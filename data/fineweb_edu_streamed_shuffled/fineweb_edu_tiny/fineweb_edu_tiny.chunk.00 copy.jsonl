Marshall, entitled \"Rapid Halfbitting Stepper\", and assigned to the same assignee as the present invention, is incorporated by reference herein for the purposes of teaching rasterization.\n\"Contour fonts\" is a term that refers to the use of outlines or contours to describe the shapes of characters used in electronic printing. In a contour font, each character shape is represented by one or more closed curves or paths that traces the boundary of the character. The contour is specified by a series of mathematical equations, which may be in any of several forms, the most common being circular arcs, straight lines, and polynomial expressions. The shape of the contour font is that of the ideal design of the character and, generally, does not depend on parameters associated with any printer. Contour fonts are ideal for use as master representations of typefaces.\nBitmap fonts or raster fonts are composed of the actual characters images that will be printed on a page, and are made by scaling contours to the appropriate size, quantizing or sampling them at the resolution of the printer, and filling the interiors of the characters with black bits or pixels. Achieving high quality in this process is difficult, except at very high resolutions, and requires knowledge of both the marking technology and typographic design considerations. Often, a bitmap font is delivered to a printer. There is a separate bitmap font for each size of a font, and sometimes separate fonts for landscape and portrait orientations.\nThe advantage of a contour font is that it can be scaled to any size and rotated to any angle by simple mathematics. Therefore, a single font suffices to represent all possible printing sizes and orientation, reducing font storage requirements, reducing the cost of font handling.\nThe difficulty in this approach is in achieving high quality character images during the sampling process which generates the raster characters from the contour masters. If the contour character is simply sampled, there will be random .+-.1 pixel variations in stroke thickness. If the printing process tends to erode black areas (common in write-white laser xerography) characters will be consistently too thin. If the printing process tends to fatten black areas (common in write black laser xerography), characters will be too thick.\nAt the high resolution employed in phototypesetters, usually greater than 1,000 spi, no special techniques are required for scaling and sampling the contour font to generate a raster font of any size. This is because although simple sampling necessarily has random one-bit errors, such errors are small compared to the size of the character, making errors insignificant. At 300, 400, and 600 spi though, character strokes are only three or four bits thick and each bit is important. The simplistic methods used by typesetter manufacturers are not sufficient.\nU.S. Pat. No. 4,675,830 to Hawkins, uses defined points in a contour font that must be grid aligned to pixel positions, but the stem widths or edges are not aligned.\nOf particular importance in generating fonts of optimal appearance are maintenance of uniform and correct stroke thickness among characters of a font and on different printing engines, uniform alignment of characters on a baseline, and uniform spacing of characters.\nIn accordance with the invention, there is provided a method for conversion of contour fonts to bitmap fonts with automatic thickening and thinning of strokes, and snapping of character edges to pixel or half pixel boundaries.\nIn accordance with the invention, there is provided a method of producing a raster font from a contour font entailing the steps of: first, deriving font metrics and character metrics of font characters in terms of arbitrary font units; scaling the font characters to a selected size and output resolution (pixels per unit length); altering the thickness of vertical and horizontal strokes of each character to a desired thickness, from the measured font metrics and character metrics, and including a difference applied to the thickness of the strokes by the printer process, to cause the strokes to be close to an integer number of pixels and thickness and to compensate for thing and thickening which the printing engine might produce; bringing the leading and trailing edges of the characters to integer pixel locations, where such locations are based on and scaling the character between the leading and trailing edges proportionally therebetween, and producing a rasterized font from the altered contour font character.\nThese and other aspects of the invention will become apparent from the following description used to illustrate a preferred embodiment of the invention in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which:\nFIG. 1 shows a block diagram of the inventive optimized scaler rasterizer system.\nFIGS. 2A-2E illustrate the development of a raster font from a contour font, using the system described in FIG. 1.\nWith reference to the drawing, where the showing is for the purpose of illustrating an embodiment of the invention and not for the purpose of limiting same, the Figure shows a block diagram of the present invention which will be referred to and described hereinafter.\nFIG. 1 shows a block diagram of the contour rasterization process of the present invention. Beginning with a contour font 10, and with a character \"H\" shown in contour for illustration purposes at FIG. 2A the contour font is analyzed initially at hint generation step 20. At the hint generation, the parameters defining the font are determined, including measurement of the following metrics and character hints:\nTABLE 1______________________________________Font Metric Comments______________________________________Cap-height Height of the H, I or similar letterX-Height Height of the lower case xAscender Height of the lower case k, b, or similar letterDescender Position of the bottom of the lower case p or qThickness of Upper Vertical stroke thicknessCase Stems on upper case H or KThickness of Upper Horizontal Stroke onCase Cross-Strokes upper case E or FThickness of Lower Vertical stroke thicknessCase Stems on lower case k or lThickness of Lower Case Horizontal strokeCross-Strokes thickness on the fThickness of AuxiliaryCharacter StemsThickness of AuxiliaryCharacter Cross-StrokesHairline thickness Thickness of the cross bar on the e or the thin part of the o______________________________________\n(See, Appendix, page 13, ICFFontIODefs.

When applied, this thickening brings fine lines up to the value of the minimum stroke thickness. The value is zero if the hairline is already greater than the minimum stroke thickness. (This process, referred to as \"adaptive thickening,\" is not disclosed in the source code in the Appendix.)\nThe actual thickening or thinning applied is equal to the sum of these three components. Each component has an independent value in the X and Y directions. The direction to move each contour control point is specified by its normal vector. The thickened character H is shown at FIG. C.\nAt step 60, the snap function or grid alignment function is applied. The coordinate system of the character is varied in the horizontal direction to move vertical and horizontal edges to positions where pixel boundaries will be after rasterization, i.e., to a whole pixel position. This is to assure uniform stroke thickness in the rasterized character images. The process is to piecewise stretch or shrink the character to force edges to align the pixel boundaries. On the left hand sides of the characters, the left edge of each stroke is moved to the closest pixel boundary, while the right edge of the stroke is moved to the pixel boundary specified by rounding the stroke thickness. This process gives priority to maintaining uniform stroke thickness over absolute stroke position. That is to say, that after the left edge of the character has been moved to a whole pixel position, the thickness of the stroke, or portion of the character, is examined to determine its thickness. The thickness has already been adjusted in the thickness of thinning step, so that it is close to a whole pixel width. Accordingly, the right edge of the character is then moved to the nearest whole pixel, based on rounding the thickness of the pixel, as opposed to moving the right hand side to the nearest pixel. On the right hand sides of characters, the rolls of left and right edges of strokes are reversed. Right edges of strokes are anchored, while left edges are rounded relatively to corresponding right edges. (see, Appendix, page 355, snap.c).\nIn one variant of this scheme, the positions of left and right index points or width points, which are those points which determine character spacing and are made to coincide in constructing words, are snapped before the vertical edges.\nIn the vertical direction, snapping is performed to piecewise stretch characters so that positions of baseline, cap-height, x-height, and descender fall on pixel boundaries. Baseline and descender position are treated as bottoms of strokes, that is, anchored, while cap-height and x-height are treated as tops of strokes, computed relative to the baseline. All characters are snapped to all of these positions, ensuring uniform character alignment. After these font metric positions are snapped, horizontal edges are snapped in the same manner as vertical edges, with lower edges of strokes anchored and upper edges snapped relative to the lower edges in the lower half of the character and upper edges of strokes anchored and lower edges snapped relative to the upper edges in the upper half of the character.\nIn both horizontal and vertical directions, snapping is performed one edge at a time. That is, the first edge is snapped, stretching the coordinate system of the character slightly on one side of the snapped edge and shrinking it slightly on the other side. The second edge is then snapped, with its pre-snapping position perhaps already modified slightly by the first snap. This sequential snapping helps preserve local character features better than simultaneous snapping of all edges does. When the second edge is snapped, its area of influence on the coordinate grid extends only up to the first snapped edge, which stays in place. This process is then repeated for the remainder of the edges. The snapped character H is shown at FIG. 2D.\nOnce each character in the adjusted contour font has been placed in the grid and appropriately thickened and thinned, the final step is to sample the adjusted contour on discrete grid. This step 70 can optionally produce half bitted output images, as controlled by the printer profile. Light half bitting produces half bitting on curves and diagonals, while heavy half bitting will also produce half bitted vertical and horizontal edges.\nRasterization in a preferred embodiment of this invention is in accordance with the process described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07\/416,211 by S. Marshall, entitled \"Rapid Halfbitting Stepper\", and assigned to the present assignee of the present invention. This application is incorporated by reference herein for the purposes of teaching rasterization. (see, Appendix, page 364, step.c and page 368, step.h for rasterization with halfbitting; page 372, bezline.c for stepping around curve; page 396, fill.c for filling). The rasterized character is shown at FIG. 2D.\nIt will not doubt be appreciated that numerous changes and modifications are likely to occur to those skilled in the art, and it is intended in the appended claims to cover all those changes and modifications which fall within the spirit and scope of the present invention.","id":"<urn:uuid:5cf8f2cc-bc5c-42e1-a62b-bddf45ac1cba>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.google.de\/patents\/US5459828","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.8994696736,"token_count":5093,"score":2.59375,"int_score":3}

Laurel wilt: A global threat to avocado production. World Avocado Congress. 186-197 In Proceedings VII World Avocado Congress. 5-9 September 2011, Cairns, Australia.\nInterpretive Summary: Laurel wilt is a lethal vascular disease of trees in the plant family Lauraceae, including avocado. It is caused by a fungal pathogen (Raffaelea lauricola) that is introduced into host trees by an exotic wood-boring beetle, the redbay ambrosia beetle (Xyleborus glabratus). The beetle was first detected in Georgia in 2002, and since has spread to six states in the southeastern U.S. Laurel wilt poses an imminent threat to commercial avocado production in south Florida, and a future threat to avocado in California, Mexico, Central and South America. Scientists at the USDA-ARS Subtropical Horticulture Research Station, in collaboration with the University of Florida, are conducting multidisciplinary research on the pest complex, including (1) evaluation of fungicides for laurel wilt, (2) screening for disease resistant avocado varieties, (3) determination of pathways for disease transmission, (4) identification of beetle attractants, repellents, and insecticides, and (5) assessment of host preferences. Information from these studies will be used by avocado growers and by state and federal action agencies engaged in monitoring programs for redbay ambrosia beetle.\nLaurel wilt kills members of the Lauraceae plant family, including avocado. The disease has invaded much of the southeastern USA, and threatens avocado commerce and homeowner production in Florida, valuable germplasm in Miami (USDA-ARS), and major production and germplasm in California and MesoAmerica. Laurel wilt is caused by a recently described fungus, Raffaelea lauricola, which is vectored by an invasive ambrosia beetle, Xyleborus glabratus. Current research topics include: disease management with fungicides; identifying host resistance; vector mitigation with insecticides and repellents; host ranges of, and interactions with, the pathogen and vector; and transmission of R. lauricola via avocado seed, scion material, root grafts and pruning tools. Although highly resistant avocado cultivars have not been identified, screening work continues on additional cultivars and new germplasm. Effective fungicides (e.g. triazoles) have been identified, but cost-effective disease management will depend on improved measures for xylem loading and retention of these chemicals. Insecticides have been identified that reduce boring activity of X. glabratus and its attraction to avocado and other hosts, but much remains to be learned about their impact on disease management. Although the disease\u2019s host range is generally restricted to American members of the Lauraceae, nonhosts that attract the beetle are known. Raffaelela lauricola rapidly colonizes avocado after infection, but to low levels; tylose and gel induction in the host, rather than xylem obstruction by fungal biomass, are associated with impeded water transport and symptom development. Seed and fruit from laurel wilt-affected avocado trees do not appear to be infected by R. lauricola.","id":"<urn:uuid:f5bb6156-473c-456e-b20e-b29dce901e8a>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.ars.usda.gov\/research\/publications\/publications.htm?seq_no_115=280283","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.8892325163,"token_count":905,"score":3.0,"int_score":3}

Tenenbaum is frustrated by how\nlittle data is shared between peers and hopes that Cancer Commons\ncould mark the dawn of a new era of open-source science.\nTenenbaum told Wired.co.uk: \"There is lots of talking in\nfragmented silos, but we want to capture all of that in one place\nand expedite the process through which science turns into\nThe first stage of Cancer Commons is to create a database where\neach different type of cancer has a \"Molecular Disease Model\" (MDM)\n-- an expert-curated reference node that catalogues the known\nmolecular subtypes of a particular cancer, linked to relevant\npathways, diagnostic tests, approved and experimental therapies and\ncurrent clinical trials. Each is akin to a dynamic research paper\nthat reflects the latest scientific, clinical and technological\nadvancements. A rapid submission and dissemination process allows\neach MDM to be maintained online and continuously updated by cancer\nspecialists and moderated by editors.\nThe project is governed by an editorial board with an impressive\nset of credentials. The 18 specialists -- chaired by George\nLundberg, former editor-in-chief of Journal of the American Medical\nAssociation and of WebMD's online properties\nand e-Medicine --\ninclude a former FDA Commissioner, a former editor of\nScience and a former president of the American Society of\nSo far, only one model has been created, for melanoma. It\nincorporates 78,185 abstracts from research papers and information\nrelating to some 1016 clinical trials that are ongoing in the\nfield. Some 11 expert editors have been assigned to that particular\nMDM, including Dr David Fisher, the head of the dermatology at\nHarvard Medical School and Dr Keith Flaherty, from the department\nof medicine at Harvard Medical School. Over the coming year the\nplan is to create MDMs for other cancers including lung, breast,\nsarcoma, and lymphoma -- each with their own experts overseeing\nIn order to harness the power of the MDM, CollabRx is developing\napps that tap into the data to aid decision-making. For example,\nthe \"Targeted Therapy Finder\" can be used by doctors to help\nidentify genetic tests that map an individual tumour's unique\ncharacteristics, and then select potential treatments based on the\nfindings. By entering information about the particular tumour,\nthey'll be given options of tests that'll help narrow down the\nparticular subtype of cancer being dealt with (as categorised by\nthe MDM), and therefore find out which treatments are the most\npromising. They can then find information about trials that are\nlooking for patients with that particular subtype.\nThe view is to develop further apps that allow doctors and\nresearchers to submit clinical observations and outcomes and then\ncollaboratively analyse them to fine-tune the MDMs. Tenenbaum would\nalso like to see patients report how they're responding to\ntreatments. He tells Wired.co.uk: \"Over time I'd like the\nresults of lab tests to go directly into the database.\"\nHe doesn't underestimate the enormity of the task, admitting\nthat not all of the details are worked out yet and that the initial\nMDMs will \"almost certainly be incomplete and wrong in places\". He\nadds: \"We don't pretend that we are going to cure cancer. But we\nought to be able to improve the outcomes for some patients.\"\nTenenbaum wants to make applications that are so compelling to\ndoctors that they'll have to use them to stay relevant in their\nfields. \"I see possibilities to slash time and development of new\ndrugs and improve patient care.\"","id":"<urn:uuid:261b3732-bc1b-48c7-9ed5-c7eb4c1cba6d>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.wired.co.uk\/news\/archive\/2011-02\/01\/cancer-commons","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9305593967,"token_count":1246,"score":2.703125,"int_score":3}

The money delivers programs to 41,500 girl members in a 34-county territory, trains more than 18,000 adult member volunteers, provides approximately $52,000 in scholarships for higher education and so much more.\nThe Girls Scouts of the USA haven't started selling their cookies online yet, but could in the next few years. The organization recommends never buying Girl Scout Cookies on any sites, including Amazon, eBay and other auction or community sites. There is no guarantee of freshness or authenticity.\nTo keep up with a technological age, the organization is using its website to help buyers easily find troops to purchase from in the area.

{"text":"Bali Climate conference has a message for rural community\nThe world leaders recognised that 20% of the global emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) can be contained by forestation. The programme, Reducing Emissions From Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) aims to compensate the developing countries in the tropical region to maintain their forests and discourages deforestation. It allows developing countries to sell carbon offsets to rich countries in return for not burning their tropical forests from 2013.\nREDD initiative is the need of the hour when largescale deforestation is taking place across the world for urbanisation, oil palm, soyabean and bio-fuel crop plantation.\nThe Bali conference also stressed upon the urgent need to cut carbon and methane emissions from tropical forests.\nThe Bali conference also adopted a resolution on adaptation fund to help poor nations to cope with damage from climate change impact like droughts, extreme weather conditions or rising seas. The Adaptation Fund now comprises only about $36 million but might rise to $1-$5 billion a year by 2030, if investments in green technology in developing nations surges. The fund distinguished the responsibilities of the Global Environment Facility and the World Bank. The fund would have a 16-member board largely from developing countries and would start operating from 2008.\nSenior researchers of the United Nations Development Fund (UNDP) had urged the developed countries to urgently discuss adaptation funds as the key to solution of the problems. The Lead author of the recent UNDP report, Kevin Watkins said that as per estimate $86 billion annually. \"The figure looks large, but actually it is only 0.2% of the rich countries GDP,\" he said and added that adaptation fund sourced from multilateral funding in the last two years was only $26 million\u2014the amount spent by UK alone on flood control for a week.\nA group of small island communities led by Biotani Indonesia Foundation has urged that the adaptation fund should include a special corpus to cover their initiatives.\nThe Bali conference succeeded in adopting a resolution on technology tranfer and also Its monitoring. It, however, failed address the vital issue of cut in GHG emissions and deferred it till 2009.\nIt also postponed until next year any consideration of a plan to fund an untested technology which captures and buries the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, emitted from power plants that burn fossil fuels.\nIt also failed to agree whether or not to allow companies to sell carbon offsets from destroying new production of powerful greenhouse gases called hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Benefiting factories have been the biggest winners under a UN scheme to reward companies which cut greenhouse gas emissions.\nBe the first to comment.","id":"<urn:uuid:425ca78c-1053-44ec-b60e-8912cf2cb747>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.financialexpress.com\/news\/Bali-Climate-conference-has-a-message-for-rural-community\/251129\/0","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.948002398,"token_count":543,"score":3.15625,"int_score":3}

Accounts Receivable\n|What are the 4 areas for conducting operations?|| 1. Purchasing|\n|What are the 4 commonly used conventions in financial statements?|| 1. The accounting period|\n2. The number of reporting periods\n3. The monetary amounts\n4. The terminology and level of detail in the financial statements\n|Common Financial Reporting Conventions, Accounting Period||The length of time covered by the financial statements. (The most common interval for external reporting is the fiscal year).|\n|Common Financial Reporting Conventions, Number of reporting periods||The number of reporting periods included in a given financial statement presentation, Both U.S. GAAP and IFRS require firms to include results for multiple reporting periods in each report.|\n|Common Financial Reporting Conventions, Monetary amounts||This includes measuring units, like thousands, millions, or billions, and the currency, such as dollars ($), euros (\u20ac), or Swedish kronor (SEK)|\n|Common Financial Reporting Conventions, Terminology and level of detail in the financial statements||U.S. GAAP and IFRS contain broad guidance on what the financial statements must contain, but neither system completely specifies the level of detail or the names of accounts. Therefore, some variation occurs.|\n|Characteristics of a Balance Sheet||A Balance Sheet:|\n1. is also known as a statement of financial position;\n2. provides information at a point in time;\n3. lists the firm's assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity and provides totals and subtotals; and\n4. can be represented as the Basic Accounting Equation.\nAssets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity\n|Accounting Equation Components|| 1. Assets|\n3. Share Holder's Equity\n|Assets|| Assets are economic resources with the potential to provide future economic benefits to a firm. |\nExamples: Cash, Accounts Receivable, Inventories, Buildings, Equipment, intangible assets (like Patents)\n|Liabilities|| Liabilities are creditors' claims for funds, usually because they have provided funds, or goods and services, to the firm.|\nExamples: Accounts Payable, Unearned Income, Notes Payable, Buildings, Accrued Salaries\n|Shareholders' Equity|| Shareholders' Equity shows the amounts of funds owners have provided and, in parallel, their claims on the assets of a firm. |\nExamples: Common Stock, Contributed Capital, Retained Earnings\n|What are the separate sections on a Balance Sheet (Balance sheet classification)||1. Current assets represent assets that a firm expects to turn into cash, or sell, or consume within approximately one year from the date of the balance sheet (i.e., accounts receivable and inventory).|\n2. Current liabilities represent obligations a firm expects to pay within one year (i.e., accounts payable and salaries payable).\n3. Non-current assets are typically held and used for several years (i.e., land, buildings, equipment, patents, long-term security investments).\n4. Noncurrent liabilities and shareholders' equity are sources of funds where the supplier of funds does not expect to receive them all back within the next year.\n|Income Statement||1. Sometimes called the statement of profit and loss by firms applying IFRS|\n2. Provides information on profitability\n3. May use the terms net income, earnings, and profit interchangeably\n4. Reports amounts for a period of time\n5. Typically one year\n6. Is represented by the Basic Income Equation:\nNet Income = Revenues - Expenses\n|Revenues||(also known as sales, sales revenue, or turnover, a term used by some firms reporting under IFRS) measure the inflows of assets (or reductions in liabilities) from selling goods and providing services to customers.|\n|Expenses||measure the outflow of assets (or increases in liabilities) used in generating revenues.|\n|Relationship between the Balance Sheet and the Income Statement|| 1. The income statement links the balance sheet at the beginning of the period with the balance sheet at the end of the period.|\n2. Retained Earnings is increased by net income and decreased by dividends.\n|Statement of Cash Flows|| The statement of cash flows (also called the|\ncash flow statement) reports information about\ncash generated from or used by:\n2. investing, and\n3. financing activities during specified time periods.\nThe statement of cash flows shows where the firm obtains or generates cash and where it spends or uses cash.\n|Classification of Cash Flows|| 1. Operations: |\ncash from customers less cash paid in carrying out the firm's operating activities\ncash paid to acquire noncurrent assets less amounts from any sale of noncurrent assets\ncash from issues of long-term debt or new capital less dividends\n|Inflows and Outflows of Cash|\n|The Relationship of the Statement of Cash Flows to the Balance Sheet and Income Statement||-The statement of cash flows explains the change in cash between the beginning and the end of the period, and separately displays the changes in cash from operating, investing, and financing activities.|\n-In addition to sources and uses of cash, the statement of cash flows shows the relationship between net income and cash flow from operations.\n|Statement of Shareholders' Equity||This statement displays components of shareholders' equity, including common shares and retained earnings, and changes in those components.|\n|Other Items in Annual Reports||Financial reports provide additional explanatory material in the schedules and notes to the financial statements.|\n|Who are the 4 main groups of people involved with the Financial Reporting Process|| 1. Managers and governing boards of reporting entities.|\n2. Accounting standard setters\nand regulatory bodies.\n3. Independent external auditors.\n4. Users of financial statements.\n|What is the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)?||An agency of the federal government, that has the legal authority to set acceptable accounting standards and enforce securities laws.|\n|What is the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)?||a private-sector body comprising five voting members, to whom the SEC has delegated most tasks of U.S. financial accounting standard-setting.|\n|GAAP||1. Common terminology includes the pronouncements of the FASB (and its predecessors) in the compilation of accounting rules, procedures, and practices known as generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).|\n2. Recently, the FASB launched its codification project which organizes all of U.S GAAP by topic (for example, revenues), eliminates duplications, and corrects inconsistencies.\n|FASB board members make standard-setting decisions guided by a conceptual framework that addresses:|| 1. Objectives of financial reporting.|\n2. Qualitative characteristics of accounting information including the relevance, reliability, and comparability of data.\n3. Elements of the financial statements.\n4. Recognition and measurement issues.\n|Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.|| Concerns over the quality of financial reporting have led, and continue to lead, to government initiatives in the United States.|\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 established the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), which is responsible for monitoring the quality of audits of SEC registrants.\n|International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)||-The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) is an independent accounting standard-setting entity with 14 voting members from a number of countries. Standards set by the IASB are International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).|\n-The FASB and IASB Boards are working toward converging their standards, based on an agreement reached in 2002 and updated since then.\n|Auditor's Opinion||Firms whose common stock is publicly traded are required to get an opinion by an independent auditor who:|\n1.Assesses the effectiveness of the firm's internal control system for measuring and reporting business transactions\n2.Assesses whether the financial statements and notes present fairly a firm's financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles\n|Basic Accounting Conventions and Concepts||1. Materiality is the qualitative concept that financial reports need not include items that are so small as to be meaningless to users of the reports.|\n2. The accounting period convention refers to the uniform length of accounting reporting periods.\n3. Interim reports are often prepared for periods shorter than a year. However, preparing interim reports does not eliminate the need to prepare an annual report.\n|Cash vs. Accrual Accounting||Cash basis|\nA firm measures performance from selling goods and providing services as it receives cash from customers and makes cash expenditures to providers of goods and services.\nA firm recognizes revenue when it sells goods or renders services and recognizes expenses in the period when the firm recognizes the revenues that the costs helped produce.\n|What Is an Account? How Do You Name Accounts?||-An account represents an amount on a line of a balance sheet or income statement (i.e., cash, accounts receivable, etc.).|\n-There is not a master list to define these accounts since they are customized to fit each specific business's needs.\n-Accountants typically follow a conventional naming system for accounts, which increases communication.\n|What Accounts Make up the Typical Balance Sheet?|\n|Current assets and current liabilities (Balance Sheet Classifications)||Receipt or payment of assets that the firm expects will occur within one year or one operating cycle.|\n|Noncurrent assets and noncurrent liabilities (Balance Sheet Classifications)||Firm expects to collect or pay these more than one year after the balance sheet date.|\n|Duality Effects of the Balance Sheet Equation (Assets = Liabilites + Shareholders' Equity)||Any single event or transaction will have one of the following four effects or some combination of these effects:|\n1.INCREASE an asset and INCREASE either a liability or shareholders' equity.\n2.DECREASE an asset and DECREASE either a liability or shareholders' equity.\n3.INCREASE one asset and DECREASE another asset.\n4.INCREASE one liability or shareholders' equity and DECREASE another liability or shareholders' equity.\nA T-account is a device or convention for organizing and accumulating the accounting entries of transactions that affect an individual account, such as Cash, Accounts Receivable, Bonds Payable, or Additional Paid-in Capital.\n|T-Account Conventions: Assets|\n|T-Account Conventions: Liabilities|\n|T-Account Conventions: Shareholders' Equity|\n|Debit vs. Credit|\nWhile T-accounts are useful to help analyze how individual transactions flow and accumulate within various accounts, journal entries formalize the reasoning that supports the transaction.\nThe attached standardized format indicates the accounts and amounts, with debits on the first line and credits (indented) on the second line:\n| Revenue or Sales:|\n(Common Income Statement Terms)\n|Assets received in exchange for goods sold and services rendered.|\n| Cost of Goods Sold:|\n(Common Income Statement Terms)\n|The cost of products sold.|\n| Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A):|\n(Common Income Statement Terms)\n|Costs incurred to sell products\/services as well as costs of administration.|\n| Research and Development (R&D) Expense:|\n(Common Income Statement Terms)\n|Costs incurred to create\/develop new products, processes, and services.|\n| Interest Income:|\n(Common Income Statement Terms)\n|Income earned on amounts lent to others or from investments in interest-yielding securities.|\n|Unique Relationships Exist Between the Balance Sheet and the Income Statement|\n|Important Account Differences||1. Balance sheet accounts are permanent accounts in the sense that they remain open, with nonzero balances, at the end of the reporting period.|\n2. In contrast, income statement accounts are temporary accounts in the sense that they start a period with a zero balance, accumulate information during the reporting period, and have a zero balance at the end of the reporting period.\n|The Financial Statement Relationships can be summarized as:|\n-After preparing the end-of-period income statement, the accountant transfers the balance in each temporary revenue and expense account to the Retained Earnings account.\n-This procedure is called closing the revenue and expense accounts. After transferring to Retained Earnings, each revenue and expense account is ready to begin the next period with a zero balance.\n|Expense and Revenue Transactions|\n|Dividend Declaration and Payment|\n|Issues of Capital Stock|\n|Posting||1. After each transaction is recognized by a journal entry, the information is transferred in the accounting system via an activity known as posting.|\n2. The balance sheet ledger accounts (or permanent accounts) where these are posted begin each period with a balance equal to the ending balance of the previous period.\n3.The income statement ledger accounts (or temporary accounts) have zero beginning balances.\n|Adjusting Entries|| There are some journal entries that are not triggered by a transaction or exchange.|\n-Rather, journal entries known as adjusting entries, result from the passage of time at the end of an accounting period or are used to correct errors (more commonly known as correcting entries).\n|Four Basic Types of Adjusting Entries|| 1.Unearned Revenues|\n|Closing Process||1. After adjusting and correcting entries are made, the income statement can be prepared.|\n2. Once completed, it is time to transfer the balance in each temporary revenue and expense account to the Retained Earnings account. This is known as the closing process.\n3. Each revenue account is reduced to zero by debiting it and each expense account is reduced to zero by crediting it.\n4. The offset account\u2014Retained Earnings\u2014is credited for the amount of total revenues and debited for the amount of total expenses.\n5. Thus, the balance of ending Retained Earnings for a period shows the difference between total revenues and total expenses.\n|Preparation of the Balance Sheet||1. After the closing process is completed, the accounts with nonzero balances are all balance sheet accounts.|\n2. We can use these accounts to prepare the balance sheet as at the end of the period.\n3. The Retained Earnings account will appear with all other balance sheet accounts and now reflects the cumulative effect of transactions affecting that account.\n|Final Step in Preparing Financial Statements: The Cash Flow Statement||1. The statement of cash flows describes the sources and uses of cash during a period and classifies them into operating, investing, and financing activities.|\n2. It provides a detailed explanation for the change in the balance of the Cash account during that period.\n3. Two approaches can be used to prepare this statement: Direct and Indirect","id":"<urn:uuid:03b12dbf-26a3-4290-b6e6-e08368916e2a>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/quizlet.com\/12638820\/financial-accounting-ch-1-2-flash-cards\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9089588523,"token_count":3227,"score":3.375,"int_score":3}
