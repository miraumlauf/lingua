{"text":"(Redirected from George C. Marshall\nGeorge Catlett Marshall (December 31, 1880\u2013October 16, 1959), was an American military leader and statesman best remembered for his leadership in the Allied victory in World War II and for his work establishing the post-war reconstruction effort for Europe, which became known as the Marshall Plan.\nMarshall was born into a middle-class family in Uniontown, Pennsylvania. While attending Virginia Military Institute he was initiated into the now dormant Beta('01) chapter of Kappa Alpha Order .\nIn 1948, he was awarded the Distiguished Achievement Award for his role and contributions during and after WWII.\nMarshall was instrumental in getting the U.S. Army and Army Air Corps reorganized and ready for war. Marshall wrote the document that would become the central strategy for all Allied operations in Europe, selected Dwight Eisenhower as Supreme Commander in Europe, and designed Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy. Throughout the remainder of the World War II, Marshall coordinated all Allied operations in Europe and the Pacific. He was characterized as the organizer of Allied victory by Winston Churchill. Time Magazine named Marshall Man of the Year in 1944.\nAfter WW II he was sent to China to negotiate a truce and build a coalition government between the Nationalists and Communists fighting the Chinese Civil War. His efforts failed and he was recalled in January 1947.\nMarshall 'retired' in November 1945 and was named Secretary of State in 1947. As such, on June 5, 1947 at a speech at Harvard University, he outlined the U.S. government's preparedness to contribute to European recovery. The European Recovery Plan, which became known as the Marshall Plan, helped Europe quickly rebuild and earned Marshall the honor of being named TIME's Man of the Year in 1948 and awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1953. In 1949 he resigned from the State Department and was named president of the American National Red Cross. He was named Secretary of Defense in 1950, but retired from politics for good in 1951 after Senator Joseph McCarthy implied he was a traitor and denounced him for making decisions that \"aided the Communist drive for world domination\". Marshall died on October 16, 1959.\nHe married Elizabeth Carter Cole of Lexington, Virginia in 1902. She died in 1927. 1930 he married Katherine Boyce Tupper Brown.\nAfter graduating from the Virginia Military Institute in 1901, he entered the U.S. Army, where he was to have a long and distinguished career. Until World War I, he was posted to various positions in the US and the Philippines, and was trained in modern warfare. During the War he had roles as a planner of both training and operations. Between WWI and WWII, he was a key planner and writer in the War Department, spent three years in China, and taught at the Army War College.\nHe went to France in the summer of 1917 as the director of training and planning for the 1st Infantry Division. In mid-1918, he was promoted to American Expeditionary Forces headquarters, where he was a key planner of American operations. He was instrumental in the design and coordination of the Meuse-Argonne offensive, which forced Germany to sue for peace.\nIn 1919 he became an aide-de-camp to General John J. Pershing. Between 1920 and 1924, while Pershing was Army Chief of Staff, Marshall worked in a number of positions in the US Army, focusing on training and teaching modern, mechanised warfare.\nHe was promoted to Brigadier General in October 1936. In 1939 he was selected by Franklin D. Roosevelt to be Army Chief of Staff, a position he held until 1945.\nDates of rank\n- Second Lieutenant, United States Army: February 2, 1902\n- First Lieutenant, United States Army: March 7, 1907\n- Captain, United States Army: July 1, 1916\n- Major, National Army: August 5, 1917\n- Lieutenant Colonel, National Army: January 5, 1918\n- Colonel, National Army: August 27, 1918\n- Major, Regular Army (reverted to permanent rank): July 1, 1920\n- Lieutenant Colonel, Regular Army: August 21, 1923\n- Colonel, Regular Army: September 1, 1933\n- Brigadier General, Regular Army: October 1, 1936\n- Major General, Regular Army: September 1, 1939\n- General, Regular Army, for service as Army Chief of Staff: September 1, 1939\n- General of the Army, Army of the United States: December 16, 1944\n- General of the Army rank made permanent in the Regular Army: April 11, 1946\nNotes about components:\n- United States Army: Regular U.S. Armed Forces prior to World War I\n- National Army: Combined conscript and regular United States forces during World War I\n- Regular Army: Regular volunteer forces after 1930.

{"text":"Discrimination against citizens because of their sexual orientation or their youth is just as unfair as discrimination based on race, religion or gender. Access to housing, hotels, theaters and restaurants should be equal to all, as a matter of plain fairness.\nThe Palm Beach County Commission recognized this truth in passing an ordinance protecting homosexuals, unmarried couples and young people from discrimination in renting or buying housing and in public accommodations. The ordinance also bans discrimination based on race, religion, gender, ethnic origin or disability, but it was the protection of gays that generated opposition and demands for a countywide referendum on the issue.\nNo other Florida county protects homosexuals against housing discrimination. In the 1970s, Dade County passed a similar ordinance but it was repealed in a voter referendum after a bitter fight.\nA Broward County effort to revise the human rights law to protect homosexuals is more complicated. The Broward law was adopted through the Florida Legislature, so a revision must get legislative approval and be ratified in a public referendum.\nPalm Beach County`s ordinance passed 4-1; commissioner Ron Howard dissented. The other four commissioners demonstrated courage by refusing to buckle under to opponents or to pass the buck to the public in a referendum. Commissioners were elected to make tough decisions; this time they did.\nThe ordinance provides exceptions: A landlord who lives on his property of four or fewer housing units and rents the rest won`t have to comply. Nor will a seasonal resident who rents his home to someone else part of the year and lives in it himself the rest of the time. Also exempt are religious organizations that own housing units.\nThose sensible exceptions leave the vast majority of housing covered under the new ordinance. Violators will face fines of up to $50,000, but it may be difficult to prove a violation. Early decisive action against violators by law enforcers, prosecutors and judges could make a clear statement that the county means business and won`t tolerate further discrimination in housing and public accommodations.","id":"<urn:uuid:04a92c65-e194-4b3c-ae6e-d4a7b6b1631d>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/articles.sun-sentinel.com\/1990-01-19\/news\/9001190945_1_ordinance-public-accommodations-housing","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9598913789,"token_count":402,"score":2.6875,"int_score":3}

{"text":"- It is not possible to clone Lonesome George now, but other endangered animals have been successfully cloned.\n- In the future, cloning and further studying Lonesome George might be possible, so scientists are focusing on preserving his tissues now.\n- Biobanks known as \"frozen zoos\" hold tissues and other remains of certain endangered animals.\nThe recent death of Lonesome George, the famed Galapagos tortoise believed to be the last representative of his subspecies, has many experts wondering how we should try to save other endangered and at-risk animals.\nCloning is one option. While cloning methods for reptiles are not as advanced as those for mammals, scientists also say they face other incredible obstacles.\n\"At the most, I could envision one male turtle of this subspecies cloned in future or maybe two males, but where are you going to get a female?\" asked Martha Gomez, a senior scientist with the Audubon Nature Institute, which has one of the world's few \"frozen zoos.\"\nFrozen Zoos stockpile biological materials from a wide variety of rare and critically endangered species. The biological material is usually composed of gametes (sperm and egg cells), embryos, tissue samples, serum and other items. Together, they represent a bank vault of irreplaceable genetic information that can be preserved for possibly hundreds of years or more. In most cases, the materials are stored in holding tanks filled with liquid nitrogen.\nOliver Ryder, director of genetics at the San Diego Zoo, spoke to Discovery News as his team was racing to the Galapagos Islands to help preserve the tissues of Lonesome George. The San Diego Zoo operates one of the other few frozen zoos.\n\"This is an extremely urgent matter,\" Ryder said. \"We had planned to meet in the Galapagos in two weeks to discuss preservation of the tortoises there. It is a bitter irony that Lonesome George died before we could even finish setting up the plans. It underscores the importance of preserving such animals.\"\n\"We are facing some logistical problems now, but we don't want to look back with 'what if's,'\" he added. \"This may be the only chance we'll have to preserve, document and study this tortoise subspecies.\"\nRyder believes discussions of cloning Lonesome George are premature at this point. Before that takes place, he thinks more must be learned about this particular tortoise's physiology and reproduction. Studying Lonesome George's remains may also help to reveal how tortoises often live to advanced ages, information that could one day lead to breakthroughs in extending human lifespans.\nFor cloning, researchers are focusing more on \"species where we have detailed knowledge of their reproductive biology,\" Ryder said. That is one reason why cats, dogs and mice were among the first animals to be cloned. Scientists are now working to clone endangered relatives of such animals, in hopes of releasing those individuals into the wild to strengthen natural populations.\nEarlier this year, Gomez and her colleagues successfully cloned endangered black-footed cats. An endangered wild ox, called a gaur, and a banteng (wild cattle) have also been successfully cloned. Work is underway to clone and otherwise increase the population of Sumatran rhinos, which presently number only about 200-300 in the wild.\nWhile one healthy clone is an interesting novelty, clones must also be able to reproduce in order to be fully successful. Gomez said that kittens of cloned wild cat parents have died \"due to problems with nuclear programing,\" but some normal kittens have resulted and continue to thrive.\nBoth she and Ryder say that there is no international policy calling for cloning and preservation of highly endangered species. Instead, isolated facilities and the work of dedicated individuals are responsible for the successes.\n\"The effort needs to be more widespread and organized,\" Gomez said.\nThrough published papers and talks, Ryder and his colleagues have repeatedly called for an organized global effort. It would need an \"overarching international body\" on par with UNESCO, he believes.\n\"The first step is saving tissue samples, as we're in the process of doing for Lonesome George,\" he said. \"But we who are among the forefront would like to train others to establish frozen zoo biobanks in other countries.\"\n\"I am confident that one day such an international structure will come together, bringing in other conservation work, such as preserving habitat,\" Ryder concluded. \"It's poignant to lose a subspecies like that of Lonesome George. People in the future will be looking back at us, wondering why we didn't act sooner.\"","id":"<urn:uuid:c901aef6-8e50-46c9-81bb-1ba56593fbbb>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/news.discovery.com\/tech\/biotechnology\/lonesome-george-cloning-120628.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9633057714,"token_count":954,"score":3.296875,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or ADHD is a common childhood illness. People who are affected can have trouble with paying attention, sitting still and controlling their impulses. There are three types of ADHD. The most common type of ADHD is when people have difficulties with both attention and hyperactivity. This is called ADHD combined type. Some people only have difficulty with attention and organization. This is ADHD inattentive subtype or Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). Other people have only the hyperactive and impulsive symptoms. This is ADHD hyperactive subtype.\nIt is a health condition involving biologically active substances in the brain. Studies show that ADHD may affect certain areas of the brain that allow us to solve problems, plan ahead, understand others' actions, and control our impulses.\nMany children and adults are easily distracted at times or have trouble finishing tasks. If you suspect that your child has ADHD, it is important to have your child evaluated by his or her doctor. In order for your child\u2019s doctor to diagnose your child with ADHD, the behaviors must appear before age 7 and continue for at least six months. The symptoms must also create impairment in at least two areas of the child's life-in the classroom, on the playground, at home, in the community, or in social settings. Many children have difficulties with their attention but attention problems are not always cue to ADHD. For example, stressful life events and other childhood conditions such as problems with schoolwork caused by a learning disability or anxiety and depression can interfere with attention.\nAccording to the National Institute of Mental Health, ADHD occurs in an estimated 3 to 5 percent of preschool and school-age children. Therefore, in a class of 25 to 30 children, it is likely that at least one student will have this condition. ADHD begins in childhood, but it often lasts into adulthood. Several studies done in recent years estimate that 30 to 65 percent of children with ADHD continue to have symptoms into adolescence and adulthood.\nNo one knows exactly what causes ADHD. There appears to be a combination of causes, including genetics and environmental influences Several different factors could increase a child's likelihood of having the disorder, such as gender, family history, prenatal risks, environmental toxins and physical differences in the brain seem to be involved.\nA child with ADHD often shows some of the following:\nDifficulties with attention:\n- trouble paying attention\n- inattention to details and makes careless mistakes\n- easily distracted\n- losing things such as school supplies\n- forgetting to turn in homework\n- trouble finishing class work and homework\n- trouble listening\n- trouble following multiple adult commands\n- difficulty playing quietly\n- inability to stay seated\n- running or climbing excessively\n- always \"on the go\"\n- talks too much and interrupts or intrudes on others\n- blurts out answers\nThe good news is that effective treatment is available. The first step is to have a careful and thorough evaluation with your child\u2019s primary care doctor or with a qualified mental health professional. With the right treatment, children with ADHD can improve their ability to pay attention and control their behavior. The right care can help them grow, learn, and feel better about themselves.\nMedications: Most children with ADHD benefit from taking medication. Medications do not cure ADHD. Medications can help a child control his or her symptoms on the day that the pills are taken.\nMedications for ADHD are well established and effective. There are two main types: stimulant and non-stimulant medications. Stimulants include methylphenidate, and amphetamine salts. Non-stimulant medications include atomoxetine. For more information about the medications used to treat ADHD, please see the Parent Med Guide. Before medication treatment begins, your child's doctor should discuss the benefits and the possible side effects of these medications. Your child\u2019s doctor should continue to monitor your child for improvement and side effects. A majority of children who benefit from medication for ADHD will continue to benefit from it as teenagers. In fact, many adults with ADHD also find that medication can be helpful.\nTherapy and Other Support: A psychiatrist or other qualified mental health professional can help a child with ADHD. The psychotherapy should focus on helping parents provide structure and positive reinforcement for good behavior. In addition, individual therapy can help children gain a better self-image. The therapist can help the child identify his or her strengths and build on them. Therapy can also help a child with ADHD cope with daily problems, pay better attention, and learn to control aggression.\nA therapist may use one or more of the following approaches: Behavior therapy, Talk therapy, Social skills training, Family support groups.\nSometimes children and parents wonder when children can stop taking ADHD medication. If you have questions about stopping ADHD medication, consult your doctor. Many children diagnosed with ADHD will continue to have problems with one or more symptoms of this condition later in life. In these cases, ADHD medication can be taken into adulthood to help control their symptoms.\nFor others, the symptoms of ADHD lessen over time as they begin to \"outgrow\" ADHD or learn to compensate for their behavioral symptoms. The symptom most apt to lessen over time is hyperactivity.\nSome signs that your child may be ready to reduce or stop ADHD medication are:\n- Your child has been symptom-free for more than a year while on medication,\n- Your child is doing better and better, but the dosage has stayed the same,\n- Your child's behavior is appropriate despite missing a dose or two,\n- Or your child has developed a newfound ability to concentrate.\nThe choice to stop taking ADHD medication should be discussed with the prescribing doctor, teachers, family members, and your child. You may find that your child needs extra support from teachers and family members to reinforce good behavior once the medication is stopped.\nWithout treatment, a child with ADHD may fall behind in school and have trouble with friendships. Family life may also suffer. Untreated ADHD can increase strain between parents and children. Parents often blame themselves when they can't communicate with their child. The sense of losing control can be very frustrating. Teenagers with ADHD are at increased risk for driving accidents. Adults with untreated ADHD have higher rates of divorce and job loss, compared with the general population. Luckily, safe and effective treatments are available which can help children and adults help control the symptoms of ADHD and prevent the unwanted consequences.","id":"<urn:uuid:40aae48c-b422-4ff3-a8dc-88f9431d1a4e>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.aacap.org\/cs\/ADHD.ResourceCenter\/adhd_faqs","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9592067003,"token_count":1307,"score":3.71875,"int_score":4}
{"text":"Deep-space communication improved with electromagnetic radiation antenna\n- Robert C. Dye\n- Technology Transfer\n- (505) 667-3404\nElectromagnetic radiation antenna has potential for deep-space communication\n- Directed Energy\n- Long-range communications\n- Medicine (Oncology)\n- RADAR imaging applications are countermeasure-resistant\n- Communications can be spatially-encrypted\n- 4-dimensional volumes of energy can be aimed at a single space-time point for directed energy applications\n- Nonspherical decay of the cusp enables low-power communications and propagation over great distances\nLos Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) researchers have developed the Lightslinger, a completely new type of antenna that produces tightly-focused packets of electromagnetic radiation fundamentally different from the emissions of conventional transmitters. The device has potential applications in RADAR, directed-energy (non-kinetic kill), secure communications, ultra-long-range communications (e.g., deep-space), medicine (oncology) and astrophysics.\nThe Lightslinger functions by producing a moving polarization pattern in a ring of alumina. By careful timing of voltages applied to electrodes that surround the alumina, the polarization pattern can be made to move superluminally, i.e., faster than the speed of light in a vacuum. Nobel laureate Vitaly Ginzberg showed both that such superluminal polarization patterns do not violate the principles of special relativity and that they emit electromagnetic radiation. Once a source travels faster than the waves that it emits, it can make contributions at multiple retarded times to a signal received instantaneously at a distance. This effect is already well known in acoustics; when a supersonic airplane accelerates through the speed of sound, a violent \u201csonic boom\u201d is heard many miles away, even if the airplane itself is rather quiet. The Lightslinger enables the same thing to be done with electromagnetic radiation; i.e., a relatively low-power source can make an \u201celectromagnetic boom\u201d, an intense concentration of radiowaves at a great distance.\nThe \u201celectromagnetic boom\u201d is due to temporal focusing, that is, focusing in the time domain. Because of this effect, part of the emitted radiation possesses an intensity that decays with distance r as 1\/r rather than as the conventional inverse square law, 1\/r2. These nonspherically-decaying wavepackets represent a game-changing technology in the applications of electromagnetic radiation.\nDevelopment stage: Working prototype\nPatent status: Patent pending\nLicensing status: Available for exclusive or non-exclusive licensing","id":"<urn:uuid:79bc5d65-38cf-489f-b8c5-6800ff88c6f7>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/moe@lanl.gov\/collaboration\/tech-transfer\/tech-transfer-summaries\/electromagnetic-radiation-antenna-has-potential-for-deep-space-communication.php","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.8813943267,"token_count":545,"score":3.34375,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Labrador Retriever originated in Newfoundland, Canada. Small water dogs were used to retrieve birds and fish; they even pulled small boats through the water. Their strong desire to work, versatility, and waterproof coats impressed fishermen, one of whom brought a dog back to England with him. Lord Malmsbury saw this dog, then called a St. John\u2019s Dog, and imported several from Newfoundland. Lord Malmsbury is credited with having started to call the dogs Labradors, although the reason is lost to history. Eventually, the English quarantine stopped additional imports from coming into the country, and the Labradors already in England were cross-bred to other retrievers. However, breed fanciers soon put a stop to that, and the breed as we know it today was born.\nLabrador Retriever is probably the most popular dog breed in the world.\nLabrador Retriever is a medium-sized, strongly built dog breed that retains its hunting and working instincts. Standing between 21.5 and 24.5 inches tall and weighing between 55 and 80 pounds, with females smaller than males, the breed is compact and well-balanced. Labrador Retrievers have short, weather-resistant coats that can be yellow, black, or chocolate. The head is broad, the eyes are friendly, and the tail is otterlike. Grooming a Labrador Retriever is not difficult, although it is amazing how much the coat can shed at times. Shedding is worst in spring and fall when the short, dense undercoat and coarser outer coat lose all the dead hair. Brushing daily during these times will lessen the amount of hair in the house.\nPhoto: Labrador Retriever puppies \u2013 Brown, Black and Yellow.\nLabrador Retrievers do everything with vigor. When it\u2019s time to play, they play hard. When it\u2019s time to take a nap, they do that with enthusiasm, too. But this desire to play and instinct to work means that Labs need vigorous exercise every day and a job to do. They need to bring in the newspaper every morning, learn to pick up their toys, and train in obedience. Labrador Retrievers do very well in many canine activities, including agility, flyball, field tests and trials, tracking, search-and-rescue work, and therapy dog work. Labrador Retrievers still enjoy swimming, and if water is available, a swim is a great way to burn off excess energy.\nEarly socialization and training can teach a Labrador Retriever puppy household rules and social manners. Training should continue throughout puppyhood and into adulthood so that the Labrador Retriever\u2019s mind is kept busy. The Labrador Retriever can learn advanced obedience, tricks, or anything else her owner wishes to teach her.\nLabrador Retrievers are great family dogs. They will bark when people approach the house but are not watchdogs or protective. Labrador Retriever puppies are boisterous and rambunctious and need to be taught to be gentle with young children. Older kids will enjoy the Lab\u2019s willingness to play. Most Labrador Retrievers are also good with other dogs and can learn to live with small pets, although interactions should be supervised. Health concerns include hip and elbow dysplasia, knee problems, eye problems, and allergies.\nThe Labrador Retriever loves to swim. However, as unlikely as it may seem, Labs do not come \u201cout of the box\u201d knowing how to swim. Furthermore, some Labs become truly nervous around water. That having been said, most Labs can be taught to swim quickly and easily, and a few simple lessons can lead to hours of enjoyment for both you and your dog. There are a number of reasons to teach your Lab to swim while he\u2019s still a pup. For one thing, it\u2019s easier on the dog. A large dog has a lot of body weight to manage in the water, and for a dog new to swimming, this can increase the slope of the learning curve. Puppies, because of their small size, have an easier time.\nSee 7.5 week old Labrador pups go to the water for the first time\nEven before you teach your Lab to swim, you can start off on the right foot by building his confidence around water. Take your dog for a walk around the local pond or lake. Encourage any interest that your dog shows in the water with verbal praise. If he is willing to get his feet wet, encourage him to do so and praise him when he does. Simple preliminaries like this lay a strong foundation for you because you teach the dog that there is no reason to fear water. Remember that the primary goal here is to provide positive experiences for your Lab around and in the water. Making sure that the aquatic site you\u2019ve chosen is safe goes a long way towards ensuring such experiences.\nLabrador Retriever Videos\nTraining Labrador Retrievers: Training Labrador puppies is best started around 2 months of age; the same time as the Labrador puppy is weaned from his mother. This life-long commitment is the beginning of a wonderful relationship between owner and dog. Here are some videos from dog training expert Melanie McLeroy to help you get started.\nTeach your Labrador to learn and respond to their name.\nTeach your Labrador to sit on command.\nTeach your Labrador to stay on command.\nTeach your Labrador to lie down on command.\nTeach your Labrador to heel.\nTeach your Labrador to come on command.\nBefore your Labrador training starts, you have to consider the training method you intend to use. This method needs to be consistent, so making the decision is one that requires some research. Many professional animal trainers use what\u2019s called positive reinforcement (believes that animals are much better behaved and easier to train when they\u2019re earning rewards and praise than if they\u2019re being punished).","id":"<urn:uuid:f1ed2d8a-27ec-4d1b-8271-d3ae5586c0ae>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/dogbreedstandards.com\/labrador-retriever\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9601872563,"token_count":1226,"score":3.078125,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Many things can trigger depression. It is common during life changes such as adolescence, marriage, birth and menopause. It can be a consequence of your upbringing - such as whether or not you were taught effective coping skills as a child. There is a genetic component to depression, and influences such as diet, stress and illness also play a part.\nBeing depressed can make you feel out of control and helpless, yet there are many ways to avoid falling into depression.\n* Examine your diet. What you eat - or don\u2019t eat - can influence your mood. The same diets that can cause heart disease and arthritis in some individuals - one that is high in sodium and saturated fat, and low in whole, fresh plant foods and unrefined essential fatty acids (EFAs) - can cause depression in others. Likewise, food allergies can also alter brain function and trigger depression (Biol Psychiatry, 1981; 16: 3-19). Wheat, milk, corn, beef and eggs are common culprits (Ann Allergy, 1982; 48: 166-71). But bear in mind that food allergies linked to depression often have an addictive quality - so whatever you eat compulsively may be contributing to the problem.\n* Psychotherapy is as effective as drugs. Cognitive behavioural therapy can help those at risk of depression to become more conscious of negative thoughts and attitudes that feed into their depressions. Patients undergoing such therapy can learn to change (or at least mitigate) these unhelpful tendencies (J Consult Clin Psychol, 1989; 57: 414-9).\n* Drug-induced depression is very common. Around 200 different classes of drugs have been implicated, including beta-blockers, tranquillisers, corticosteroids and birth-control pills, as well as alcohol and recreational drugs. If you think you may be reacting to a drug, consider switching to another family of drugs or trying other options.\n* Environmental pollutants such as heavy metals, petrochemicals, pesticides and other toxins can disrupt the nervous system and lead to mild, but chronic, mood disorders, including depression (Med Clin North Am, 1990; 74: 325-45). Similarly, exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs), especially at work (West J Med, 2000; 173: 94-100) can lead to more depression and suicide in some vulnerable individuals (Bioelectromagnetics, 2001; [Suppl 5]: S132-43).\n* St John\u2019s wort is the most effective herbal remedy for mild depression because it works in a similar way to conventional antidepressants. A standardised extract (0.03 per cent hypericin) usually at a dose of 300 mg three times a day can be just as effective as antidepressant drugs (BMJ, 1996; 313: 253-8). What\u2019s more, the side-effects are minimal.\n* Traditional acupuncture can be as good as conventional drugs for preventing relapses in depression (Compl Ther Med, 2001; 9: 216-8).\n* Electroacupuncture can benefit those suffering from major depression who cannot tolerate the side-effects of antidepressant drugs (Psychiatry Clin Neurosci, 1998; 52 [Suppl]: S338-40).\n* Stay active. People who exercise regularly have less depression (Prev Med, 2003; 36: 698- 703). Typically, any aerobic exercise, such as walking or jogging, for 20-30 minutes three or four times a week will benefit mild-to-moderate depression (BMJ, 1985; 291: 109).\n* Acknowledge your feelings. Depressed individuals often try to suppress their \u2018bad\u2019 feelings, especially those concerning distressing life experiences. \u2018Confessing\u2019 your most troubling feelings and experiences in a private diary can have significant long-term benefits on both mental and physical health (J Abnorm Psychol, 1986; 95: 274-81; J Consult Clin Psychol, 1989; 57: 414-9).\n* Get a good night\u2019s sleep. Since depression and lack of sleep can form a vicious circle, make sure you sleep well. Stick to regular bedtimes; having curtains that keep the light out will help regulate night-time melatonin secretion; and don\u2019t exercise or take stimulants such as coffee or alcohol before going to bed.","id":"<urn:uuid:9171d770-9281-450b-b87c-28bc5e2c8f52>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.healthy.net\/scr\/article.aspx?Id=2809","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9212630391,"token_count":882,"score":3.265625,"int_score":3}
{"text":"CHICAGO \u2013 Nearly 1 in 20 Americans older than 50 have artificial knees, or more than 4 million people, according to the first national estimate showing how common these replacement joints have become in an aging population.\nDoctors know the number of knee replacement operations has surged in the last decade, especially in baby boomers. But until now, there was no good fix on the total number of people living with them.\nThe estimate is important because it shows that a big segment of the population might need future knee-related care, said Dr. Daniel Berry, president of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons and chairman of orthopedic surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. He was not involved in the research.\nPeople with knee replacements sometimes develop knee infections or scar tissue that require additional treatment. But also, even artificial knees wear out, so as the operations are increasingly done on younger people, many will live long enough to almost certainly need a second or even third knee replacement.\n\u201cThese data are sobering because we didn\u2019t know what an army of people we\u2019ve created over the last decade,\u201d said Elena Losina, lead author of the analysis and co-director of the Orthopedics and Arthritis Center for Outcomes Research at Harvard\u2019s Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. \u201cThe numbers will only increase, based on current trends.\u201d\nReplacement joints can greatly improve quality of life for people with worn-out knees, but they\u2019re not risk-free and it\u2019s a major operation that people should not take lightly, she said.\nModern knee replacements in the United States date to the 1970s. Since then, advances in materials and techniques, including imaging scans to create better-fitting joints, have made the implants more durable and lifelike, surgeons say.\nLosina and colleagues came up with their estimate by analyzing national data on the number of knee replacements done from 1998-2009, U.S. census data, death statistics and national health surveys.\nFor example, in 2009, more than 600,000 knee replacement operations were done nationwide. The study estimate includes people who had knee replacement operations that year and in previous years who are still living.\nOverall, 4.5 million Americans are living with artificial knees. That includes an estimated 500,000 who have had at least two replacement operations on the same knee.\nKnee replacements are most common in people older than 80 \u2013 1 in 10 people in this age range have them, the study found. Though they\u2019re less prevalent in people younger than that, there are still more than half a million Americans in their 50s with the artificial joints, and based on current trends, operations in that age group are expected to increase.\nAccording to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, knee replacements tripled in people ages 45 to 64 between 1997 and 2009.\nDoctors think two trends have contributed to that increase: the nation\u2019s obesity epidemic and amateur athletes who don\u2019t adjust workouts to spare aging or even injured joints. Both can lead to or worsen arthritis, the main reason for replacing knees.\nDonna Brent, 63, is in the latter category. The Deerfield, Ill., administrative assistant says decades of racquetball, tennis, softball and other sports took a toll on her knees, but she got used to living with the pain, even when she became bowlegged and developed a limp. When pain \u201cstarted getting in the way of some of my sports,\u201d she gave in to her doctor\u2019s advice and had the operation last June on her right knee. She said she feels better than ever, is back to exercising and plans to resume tennis and softball when the weather warms up.\nDuring knee replacement operations, surgeons slice off a small portion of the worn-out surface on the ends of both leg bones that meet at the knee, then implant an artificial joint usually made of plastic or metal. Typical operations last about two hours, require a few days in the hospital and cost about $40,000.\nArtificial knees generally last 15 to 20 years. While some are promoted as lasting 30 years, these estimates are generally based on use among older people more sedentary than baby boomers who expect new knees to let them be as active as they were before surgery. Sometimes that\u2019s possible, though doctors often discourage knee replacement patients from engaging in high-impact sports including jogging.\nThe National Institute of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases paid for the study.","id":"<urn:uuid:62078429-1038-4e59-b941-96afd2102c07>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.durangoherald.com\/article\/20120220\/LIFESTYLE04\/702209984\/0\/lifestyle01\/Nearly-4M-US-adults%E2%80%99-knees-are-faking-it","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9672857523,"token_count":940,"score":2.53125,"int_score":3}

Sometimes we can identify the cause accurately enough from your phone or e-mail description of what is happening and what you see. Sometimes we can do this from photographs you submit, either electronically or printed on paper. But sometimes word descriptions and photographs aren't quite good enough, and we ask you to submit a specimen of an arthropod you have found, or the damage it has caused.\nThe information we give you is only as good as the information you give to us. I can't identify specimens that look like the one in the photograph above. Here are some hints that will help all of us:\n1. Make sure any photographs are CLEAR and take several, from very close up to farther away. Make sure you have sufficient light, or that you compensate with your camera to make sure we can clearly see what you are trying to show us. Learn how to use the close up mode on your digital camera.\n2. You have 20,000 of something flying around? Please give us at least - oh maybe - six of them. If it's something unusual, we need at least one full, intact set of key characteristics. If there are big individuals and little ones, try to submit a few of each size. Maybe they're different, maybe they're not, but we won't know for sure unless we see them.\n3. Label your material. Where and when was it found? What does it seem to be doing?\n4. You had 20,000 last week, but you can't find even one now? Maybe you don't have the problem anymore. Keep an eye on the situation and try not to worry.\n5. That doesn't go for termites. If you think you had a termite swarm, worry! Keep a close eye on it, try to find a least one, even if it's only a wing, and submit it for identification.\n6. You can kill most small pests by putting them in the freezer or by dropping them into alcohol. Any sort of alcohol will do. The alcohol not only kills them, it also preserves them. Never submit arthropod specimens in water (unless they are living aquatic animals). Moths and butterflies are easier to identify if they are not preserved in alcohol, so just freeze them and bring them in dry. We can also take live specimens.\n7. Some insects and mites are most easily submitted on or in a piece of the plant they are living on. It's best if the sample is as fresh as possible. Don't bake it in a hot car.\n8. A few creatures can't be identified from the sample you submit. Ants are most easily identified from the workers (the ones without the wings). Some spiders can only be identified to species if you have adults of both sexes. Small larvae, nymphs and eggs can be extremely difficult to identify. That's just the way it is.\n9. Entomologists specialize. Sometimes we have to send things off. If they only have to go to the university, turn-around time can be quick. If they have to go further, it may be a long time before you hear back.

{"text":"You're using more water than you think\nA water footprint is the total volume of freshwater used to produce the goods and services consumed. Here are some ways to lighten your water footprint.\nFri, Aug 31 2012 at 11:28 AM\nProdded by environmental consciousness \u2014 or penny pinching \u2014 you installed low-flow showerheads and fixed all the drippy facets. Knowing that your manicured lawn was sucking down an unnatural amount of water \u2014 nearly 7 billion gallons of water is used to irrigate home landscaping, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency \u2014 you ripped up the turf and replaced it with native plants.\nYou\u2019re still using a lot more water than you think.\nThe drought of 2012 has generated images of parched landscapes and sun-baked lakebeds. At least 36 states are projecting water shortages between now and 2013, according to a survey by the federal General Accounting Office. Water supplies are finite, and fickle.\nWater, we all know, is essential to life. It is also essential to agriculture, industry, energy and the production of trendy T-shirts. We all use water in ways that go way beyond the kitchen and bathroom. The measure of both direct and indirect water use is known as the water footprint.\nYour water footprint is the total volume of freshwater used to produce the goods and services consumed, according to the Water Footprint Network, an international nonprofit foundation based in the Netherlands. The Water Footprint Network has crunched the numbers and developed an online calculator to help you determine the size of your footprint.\nYou\u2019ll be astonished to know how much water you\u2019re using \u2026 once you\u2019ve converted all those metric measurements into something you can understand.\nThe average American home uses about 260 gallons of water per day, according to the EPA.\nThat quarter-pound burger you just gobbled down? More than 600 gallons of water.\nThat Ramones T-shirt? More than 700 gallons.\nSo, adjustments to your diet and buying habits can have a much greater impact on the size of your water footprint than taking 40-second showers.\nA pound of beef, for example, takes nearly 1,800 gallons of water to produce, with most of that going to irrigate the grains and grass used to feed the cattle. A pound of chicken demands just 468 gallons. If you really want to save water, eat more goat. A pound of goat requires 127 gallons of water.\nWe\u2019ve been told to cut down on our use of paper to save the forests, but going paperless also saves water. It takes more than 1,300 gallons of water to produce a ream of copy paper.\nEven getting treated water to your house requires electricity. Letting your faucet run for five minutes, the EPA says, uses about as much energy as burning a 60-watt light bulb for 14 hours. Reducing your water footprint also reduces your carbon footprint, the amount of greenhouse gases your lifestyle contributes to the atmosphere and global warming.\nSo, you could say that conserving water is more than hot air. It\u2019s connected to almost everything you do.\nRelated water stories on MNN:","id":"<urn:uuid:cca5126a-d443-4b80-89a5-01bc0108a268>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.mnn.com\/earth-matters\/wilderness-resources\/stories\/youre-using-more-water-than-you-think","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9378925562,"token_count":660,"score":2.640625,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Forcing yourself to look at the big picture, or pretending that you are a fly on the wall observing a scene as it unfolds, can be an effective anger management strategy.\nExperts say that changing the focus from being a participant in a stressful situation, to being an observer from a distanced perspective can help an individual come to a true understanding of their feelings.\nResearchers call this strategy \u201cself-distancing.\u201d\nIn a new study, college students who believed a lab partner was berating them for not following directions responded less aggressively and showed less anger when they were told to take analyze their feelings from a self-distanced perspective.\n\u201cThe secret is to not get immersed in your own anger and, instead, have a more detached view,\u201d said Dominik Mischkowski, lead author of the research performed at Ohio State University.\n\u201cYou have to see yourself in this stressful situation as a fly on the wall would see it.\u201d\nWhile other studies have examined the value of self-distancing for calming angry feelings, this is the first to show that it can work in the heat of the moment, when people are most likely to act aggressively, Mischkowski said.\nThe worst thing to do in an anger-inducing situation is what people normally do: try to focus on their hurt and angry feelings to understand them, said Brad Bushman, Ph.D., a co-author of the study.\n\u201cIf you focus too much on how you\u2019re feeling, it usually backfires,\u201d Bushman said.\n\u201cIt keeps the aggressive thoughts and feelings active in your mind, which makes it more likely that you\u2019ll act aggressively.\u201d\nStudy findings are found online in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology and will be published in a future print edition.\nTo prove the concept, researchers performed to related studies. The first involved 94 college students who were told they were participating in a study about the effects of music on problem solving, creativity and emotions.\nThe students listened to an intense piece of classical music while attempting to solve 14 difficult anagrams (rearranging a group of letters to form a word such as \u201cpandemonium\u201d). They had only seven seconds to solve each anagram, record their answer and communicate it to the experimenter over an intercom.\nBut the plan of the study was to provoke the students into anger, which the experimenters did using a technique which has been used many times in similar studies.\nThe experimenter interrupted the study participants several times to ask them to speak louder into the intercom, finally saying \u201cLook, this is the third time I have to say this! Can\u2019t you follow directions? Speak louder!\u201d\nAfter this part of the experiment, the participants were told they would be participating in a task examining the effects of music on creativity and feelings.\nThe students were told to go back to the anagram task and \u201csee the scene in your mind\u2019s eye.\u201d They were put into three groups, each of which were asked to view the scene in different ways.\nSome students were told to adopt a self-immersed perspective (\u201csee the situation unfold through your eyes as if it were happening to you all over again\u201d) and then analyze their feelings surrounding the event.\nOthers were told to use the self-distancing perspective (\u201cmove away from the situation to a point where you can now watch the event unfold from a distance and watch the situation unfold as if it were happening to the distant you all over again\u201d) and then analyze their feelings.\nThe third control group was not told how to view the scene or analyze their feelings.\nEach group was told to replay the scene in their minds for 45 seconds. Then the researchers tested the participants for aggressive thoughts and angry feelings.\nResults showed that students who used the self-distancing perspective had fewer aggressive thoughts and felt less angry than both those who used the self-immersed approach and those in the control group.\n\u201cThe self-distancing approach helped people regulate their angry feelings and also reduced their aggressive thoughts,\u201d Mischkowski said.\nIn a second study, the researchers went further and showed that self-distancing can actually make people less aggressive when they\u2019ve been provoked.\nIn this study, 95 college students were told they were going to do an anagram task, similar to the one in the previous experiment. But in this case, they were told they were going to be working with an unseen student partner, rather than one of researchers (in reality, it actually was one of the researchers).\nIn this case, the supposed partner was the one who delivered the scathing comments about following directions.\nAs in the first study, the participants were then randomly assigned to analyze their feelings surrounding the task from a self-immersed or a self-distanced perspective.\nParticipants assigned to a third control group did not receive any instructions regarding how to view the scene or focus on their feelings.\nNext, the participants were told they would be competing against the same partner who had provoked them earlier in a reaction-time task. The winner of the task would get the opportunity to blast the loser with noise through headphones \u2013 and the winner chose the intensity and length of the noise blast.\nInvestigators discovered participants who used the self-distancing perspective to think about their partners\u2019 provocations showed lower levels of aggression than those in the other two groups. That is, their noise blasts against their partner tended to be shorter and less intense.\n\u201cThese participants were tested very shortly after they had been provoked by their partner,\u201d Mischkowski said.\n\u201cThe fact that those who used self-distancing showed lower levels of aggression shows that this technique can work in the heat of the moment, when the anger is still fresh.\u201d\nOf interest is the discovery that those who used the self-distancing approach showed less aggression than those in the control group, who were not told how to view the anger-inducing incident with their partner.\nThis suggests people may naturally use a self-immersing perspective when confronted with a provocation \u2013 a perspective that is not likely to reduce anger.\nThus, the tendency to immerse oneself in a problem (anger) to work through the situation, may backfire and make an individual more aggressive.\nA better technique to use when angry is distraction \u2013 thinking of something calming to take the mind off the anger. However, even this technique is only a short-term strategy.\nMischkowski believes the research clearly shows that self-distancing is the best method to mitigate anger.\n\u201cBut self-distancing really works, even right after a provocation \u2013 it is a powerful intervention tool that anyone can use when they\u2019re angry.\u201d\nSource: Ohio State University","id":"<urn:uuid:02ca231a-b8c6-40ad-8911-29c64d8023f8>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/psychcentral.com\/news\/2012\/07\/03\/self-distancing-can-calm-aggression\/41098.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9779151082,"token_count":1421,"score":3.296875,"int_score":3}

That's equal to the amount of water used by nearly 99,000 U.S. residences annually, or enough to fill 16,000 Olympic-size pools. Ford's reduced consumption rates mean even more to regions around the world struggling with water-related issues like drought and extensive population growth.\nFord's water reduction success is a result of the company's commitment to reduce the amount of water it uses by aggressively monitoring and managing just about every drop of water going into and out of its facilities and properties, says Andy Hobbs, director, Environmental Quality Office.\nSince 2000, Ford decreased the total amount of water used around the world annually from 64 million cubic meters to 24 million cubic meters.\n\"That's about 10.6 billion gallons of water that was conserved and went to use somewhere else,\" says Hobbs.\nFord voluntarily launched its Global Water Management Initiative in 2000, putting in place ways to manage water conservation, quality and reuse of storm and process water. Ford's water strategy complements the company's overall Code of Human Rights, Basic Working Conditions and Corporate Responsibilities.\n\"Ford recognizes the critical importance of water, and is committed to conserving water and using it responsibly,\" says Robert Brown, vice president, Sustainability, Environment and Safety Engineering. \"Many vehicle manufacturing processes require water and the resource is used at every point in our supply chain.\"\nFord aims to use an average of 1,056 gallons of water to make each vehicle globally \u2013 consistent with its overall goal of a 30 percent reduction in the amount of water used per vehicle between 2009 and 2015. That is slightly more than the 1,000 gallons fire engine tankers in the U.S. are required to contain in their tanks. One cubic meter of water is equal to 264 gallons.\nContinuing the progress\nFord had a positive impact on the world's water supply in many ways during 2012. The Ford Fund, for example, supported 19 different water-related projects in China, Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, India, Germany and South Africa.\nOne project in arid Southwest China, for instance, involved 60 Ford employees from Nanjing, who helped eight families build water cellars designed to capture water during the rainy season to store and use during drier times of the year.\nAt the same time, Ford's biggest water-related projects were within its own facilities and included:\nThese accomplishments reflect Ford's overall approach to water use, which emphasizes several goals:\nMore information about Ford's water use-related efforts can be found in the company's annual sustainability report that is released annually every June.

{"text":"This book was the chosen book for the Celebration of Reading campaign, 2012\nA Dog Named Worthless:\nA Hero Is Born Children's Book\nfor K-6th Grade Humane Education\nA Dog Named Worthless: A Hero Is Born\nWritten and illustrated by Rocky Shepheard\nWelcome to Dogs Deserve Better's first Fantasy Action\/Adventure Fiction picture book for kids and adults alike! Disney-esque in tone, the book is beautifully illustrated and written by Rocky Shepheard, a long-time supporter and advocate for chained dogs. The book is full color, hardback for better protection and sturdiness, and comes to life on 32 pages.\nWorthless is a chained dog who has never lived inside the house. He suffers through cold winters and hot summers only with the help of his two friends\u2014Otto and Sly Fox. His friends plot to free him and they set off on an adventure to look for a new life somewhere where there are no chains.\nThey search for days in snow and ice until they find a place on the edge of a pond to hunker down for the winter.\nBut fate intervenes and presents an opportunity for Worthless to finally prove to himself that he is worthy of love and a good home. Will Worthless have the courage to face his fears and become the dog he has always wanted to be?\nAbout Worthless: Worthless was the name of a real dog, he was the reason that Dogs Deserve Better was founded and that's why the book was named after him. Someone actually named their dog Worthless, can you believe that? Read about his rescue here. It was fitting that the winning contest model for the book was another black lab named Maggie, beloved companion of Joe Maringo of SPARRO.\nDan Piraro - Internationally acclaimed cartoonist and creator of Bizarro:\n\"'A New Name for Worthless: A Hero is Born' is, like it's title character, anything but worthless. This is an exciting story with a full range of emotions that kids will love and adults will take pause to think about.\nThe same story that is lovingly illustrated within plays itself out in communities all over the world and the lessons learned from this story are simple but so important.

For adults, it signifies\nhope and the progress being made for the lives of chained dogs all\nover the world.\"\nTravel books exploring our unique bond with animals\nDDB Founder Tamira Thayne:\n\"When Rocky presented his idea, I was instantly intrigued by a story that is less about the reality of everyday chaining, and more a fun fiction tale featuring animal friends and foes.

The book shows children everyone has worth and is a great lesson in self esteem, as well as emphasizing the importance of loyalty and friendship and what can be accomplished when friends work together. It shows the importance of compassion and love and should inspire kids to ask questions about animal cruelty and neglect.

{"text":"Our opinion: Fostering better nutrition is a key to reducing public health costs. That makes the scarcity of large grocery stores in some urban neighborhoods, especially poor ones, a matter of public policy.\nIt\u2019s easy, and comforting, to assume that in an modern, industrialized nation, everyone eats well. Surely with programs like food stamps, even needy people are doing OK, right?\nMore than 40,000 people in Albany and Schenectady live in what are known as food deserts \u2014 places where a grocery store is at least a mile away. Many are poor. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that about 3,700 of the more than 23,000 people in Albany who don\u2019t live near a large grocer are poor. In Schenectady, about 5,400 of the more than 19,000 people for whom a supermarket trip is more like a trek are low income. Moreover, those estimates were based largely on information gathered before a recession that has made even more people poor.\nThat\u2019s not just an inconvenience. It\u2019s a public health issue in a society where the problems associated with poor nutrition and obesity are linked to the growing cost of public health care.\nOne suggestion for alleviating the problem comes from the American Cancer Society, which is reviving the controversial idea of a tax on soda and other sugar-sweetened drinks. The group suggests using the tax to help fund and evaluate child obesity programs. An even more productive use might be to devote a portion of such a tax to local efforts to lure larger grocery stores to urban neighborhoods that don\u2019t have them now.\nIt would seem doubtful, though, that the state Legislature will be any more inclined to implement a soda tax than it was last year, when it refused to do so even with the prospect of raising $400 million in new revenue and even with the urging of the state health commissioner and then-Gov. David Paterson.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not worth trying for a soda tax \u2014 encouraging kids in particular to cut back on sugary beverages is not a bad goal at all, nor is raising funds that could be used to promote a healthier citizenry. But the more likely reality is that New York and communities will have to find ways to do something about poor nutrition and food deserts without the help of a soda tax.\nHere\u2019s one direction: Since last March, Capital District Community Gardens has been supplying nine convenience stores and markets with fresh produce under a five-year, $175,000-a-year grant from the state Health Department that also helps underwrite fitness programs. Veggie Mobile Sprout, as this program is called, delivers produce twice a week at wholesale prices, enabling urban stores in Albany and Schenectady to sell fresh food at supermarket rates and offer something better than their typical fare of often fattening and less nutritious processed food. The program\u2019s goal is to become self-sustaining.\nHow many more ideas to promote healthy and affordable food choices are there that might perhaps benefit from some initial public investment or other support? Why not make identifying and nurturing those ideas part of the mission of local community development or economic development entities?\nFunding for such programs would not be handouts; beyond improving nutrition and reducing obesity with a long-term eye toward reducing public health costs, they would help get greater value out of the public assistance that goes to people in low-income neighborhoods.\nSounds like a shopping cart full of public interest to us.","id":"<urn:uuid:fc2b2237-bb58-4d64-ab60-655ff3250f48>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/blog.timesunion.com\/opinion\/green-up-%E2%80%A8urban-deserts\/16365\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9627323151,"token_count":725,"score":2.65625,"int_score":3}

{"text":"DEPUTIES OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE\nDEPUTIES OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE, representatives of Jewish communities in Russia to the government during the reign of *Alexander I (1801\u201325). After parts of *Poland-Lithuania had been annexed by Russia, the large communities sent shtadlanim to the court at St. Petersburg to represent them and defend their rights. Most of the shtadlanim were merchants or contractors who visited the city on business. When a committee was set up to frame a \"Jewish constitution\" in 1802\u201304 it was joined by several government-appointed Jewish advisers (N.N. *Notkin, A. *Peretz, and J.L. *Nevakhovich). The government also requested some important communities to send representatives to the committee. Together they tried to influence the committee in favor of Jewish rights. In 1807 the government appointed a \"Jewish committee\" to implement the inimical \"Jewish constitution\" of 1804 and proposed that the communities elect deputies to represent the Jews before the provincial governors. The memoranda of these deputies were referred to the \"Jewish committee\" in St. Petersburg and were influential in obtaining a temporary halt to the expulsion of Jews from the villages. It was also proposed to abolish the prohibition on the lease and sale of alcohol by Jews. During the invasion by Napoleon two \"deputies of the Jewish people,\" Zundel Sonnenberg and Eliezer Dillon, accompanied Alexander's military headquarters in 1812\u201313, and acted as liaison between the czar and the large Jewish population in the combat area. They regularly presented memoranda and petitions concerning Jewish affairs to the court and transmitted its instructions to the Jewish communities. After the war an attempt was made to convert the committee of deputies into a permanent institution. The Jewish communities were requested to send representatives to St. Petersburg to maintain permanent contact with the ministries of religious affairs and popular education. On August 19, 1818, electors from the 12 districts (gubernia) of the *Pale of Settlement convened and elected three deputies, Zundel Sonnenberg, Beinush Lapkovski, and Michael Eisenstadt, and three deputy representatives. In order to raise funds to cover their expenses, which probably also included furnishing bribes, the assembly resolved that every Jew was to donate the silver headpiece of his prayer shawl. The change in Alexander's policy toward the Jews at the end of his reign reduced the importance and status of the deputies. Sonnenberg was dismissed because of \"impudence toward the authorities.\" In 1825 the Jewish deputation was officially suspended \"until the need arises for a new deputation,\" and the institution was thereby abolished and not renewed. However, the government continued to make use of Jewish representatives. In 1840 consultative committees, chosen from among \"enlightened\" Jews, were created and attached to governors in Kiev and five other towns. In 1844 the function of \"Learned Jew\" (uchoni yevrei) was created, meaning an expertand consultant in Jewish religious affairs attached to the district governers and responsible for education and interior affairs.\nJ.I.

{"text":"Mexican America - Introduction\n\"Mexican America\" is a sampling of objects from the collections of the National Museum of American History. The stories behind these objects reflect the history of the Mexican presence in the United States. They illustrate a fundamentally American story about the centuries-old encounter between distinct (yet sometimes overlapping) communities that have coexisted but also clashed over land, culture, and livelihood.\nWho, where, and what is Mexico? Over time, the definitions and boundaries of Mexico have changed. The Aztec Empire and the area where N\u00e1hautl was spoken\u2014today the region surrounding modern Mexico City\u2014was known as Mexico. For 300 years, the Spanish colonizers renamed it New Spain.\nWhen Mexico was reborn in 1821 as a sovereign nation, its borders stretched from California to Guatemala. It was a huge and ancient land of ethnically, linguistically, and economically diverse regions that struggled for national unity. Texas, (then part of the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas) was a frontier region far from the dense cities and fertile valleys of central Mexico, a place where immigrants were recruited from the United States. The immigrants in turn declared the Mexican territory an independent republic in 1836 (later a U.S. state), making the state the first cauldron of Mexican American culture. By 1853, the government of Mexico, the weaker neighbor of an expansionist United States, had lost what are today the states of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and parts of Colorado and Wyoming. In spite of the imposition of a new border, the historical and living presence of Spaniards, Mexicans, indigenous peoples, and their mixed descendants remained a defining force in the creation of the American West.\n\u201cLa Am\u00e9rica Mexicana\u201d es una muestra conformada por objetos provenientes de las distintas colecciones del Museo Nacional de Historia Americana. Estos objetos reflejan la historia de la presencia mexicana en los Estados Unidos e ilustran una cr\u00f3nica fundamentalmente americana acerca del encuentro centenario entre comunidades diferentes que han coexistido, pero que tambi\u00e9n se han enfrentado, en la pugna por la tierra, la cultura y el sustento.\n\u00bfQui\u00e9n, d\u00f3nde y qu\u00e9 es M\u00e9xico? Con el transcurso del tiempo, las definiciones y los l\u00edmites de M\u00e9xico han ido cambiando. Se conoc\u00eda como M\u00e9xico al Imperio Azteca y toda el \u00e1rea donde se hablaba n\u00e1huatl \u2014actualmente la regi\u00f3n circundante a la ciudad de M\u00e9xico. Durante 300 a\u00f1os los colonizadores espa\u00f1oles se refirieron a ella como Nueva Espa\u00f1a. Cuando en 1821 M\u00e9xico resurgi\u00f3 como una naci\u00f3n soberana, sus fronteras se extend\u00edan desde California a Guatemala. En ese entonces era un antiguo e inmenso territorio conformado por regiones \u00e9tnica, ling\u00fc\u00edstica y econ\u00f3micamente diversas que luchaban por adquirir unidad nacional. Texas (en ese entonces parte de los estados mexicanos de Coahuila y Tejas) era una regi\u00f3n fronteriza lejos de las densas urbes y de los f\u00e9rtiles valles de M\u00e9xico central, donde se reclutaban inmigrantes de los Estados Unidos.

General Winfield Scott, in the lower left on a white horse, led the southern division of the U.S. Army that successfully captured Mexico City during the Mexican American War. The outcome of American victory was the loss of Mexico's northern territories, from California to New Mexico, by the terms set in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. It should be noted that the two countries ratified different versions of the same peace treaty, with the United States ultimately eliminating provisions for honoring the land titles of its newly absorbed Mexican citizens. Despite notable opposition to the war from Americans like Abraham Lincoln, John Quincy Adams, and Henry David Thoreau, the Mexican-American War proved hugely popular. The United States' victory boosted American patriotism and the country's belief in Manifest Destiny.\n- This large chromolithograph was first distributed in 1848 by Nathaniel Currier of Currier and Ives, who served as the \"sole agent.\" The lithographers, Sarony & Major of New York (1846-1857) copied it from a painting by \"Walker.\" Unfortunately, the current location of original painting is unknown, however, when the print was made the original painting was owned by a Captain B. S. Roberts of the Mounted Rifles. The original artist has previously been attributed to William Aiken Walker as well as to Henry A. Walke. William Aiken Walker (ca 1838-1921) of Charleston did indeed do work for Currier and Ives, though not until the 1880's and he would have only have been only 10 years old when this print was copyrighted. Henry Walke (1808\/9-1896) was a naval combat artist during the Mexican American War who also worked with Sarony & Major and is best known for his Naval Portfolio.\n- Most likely the original painting was done by James Walker (1819-1889) who created the \"Battle of Chapultepec\" 1857-1862 for the U.S. Capitol. This image differs from the painting commissioned for the U. S. Capitol by depicting the troops in regimented battle lines with General Scott in a more prominent position in the foreground. James Walker was living in Mexico City at the outbreak of the Mexican War and joined the American forces as an interpreter. He was attached to General Worth's staff and was present at the battles of Contreras, Churubusco, and Chapultepec. The original painting's owner, Captain Roberts was assigned General Winfield Scott to assist Walker with recreating the details of the battle of Chapultepec. When the painting was complete, Roberts purchased the painting. By 1848, James Walker had returned to New York and had a studio in New York City in the same neighborhood as the print's distributor Nathaniel Currier as well as the lithographer's Napoleon Sarony and Henry B. Major.\n- This popular lithograph was one of several published to visually document the war while engaging the imagination of the public. Created prior to photography, these prints were meant to inform the public, while generally eliminating the portrayal of the more gory details. Historians have been able to use at least some prints of the Mexican War for study and to corroborate with the traditional literary forms of documentation. As an eyewitness, Walker could claim accuracy of detail within the narrative in his painting. The battle is presented in the grand, historic, heroic style with the brutality of war not portrayed. The print depiction is quite large for a chromo of the period. In creating the chromolithographic interpretation of the painting, Sarony & Major used at least four large stones to produce the print \"in colours,\" making the most of their use of color. They also defined each figure with precision by outlining each in black. This print was considered by expert\/collector Harry T. Peters as one of the finest ever produced by Sarony & Major.\n- Currently not on view\n- Date made\n- associated date\n- Currier, Nathaniel\n- Scott, Winfield\n- Sarony & Major\n- Walker, James\n- ID Number\n- catalog number\n- accession number\n- Data Source\n- National Museum of American History, Kenneth E.

{"text":"Phantom Phone Calls\nospri.net- Alleged contact with the dead has occurred universally throughout history, taking various forms; as dreams, waking visions and auditory hallucinations, either spontaneous or induced through trance. In many cultures, the spirits of the dead have been sought for their wisdom, advice and knowledge of the future. The dead also seem to initiate their own communication, using whatever means seem to be most effective.\nWith the advent of electromagnetic technology, mysterious messages have been communicated by telegraph, wireless, phonographs and radio. A curious phenomenon of modern times is the communication via the telephone. Phone calls from the dead seem to be random and occasional\noccurrences that happen without explanation. The great majority are exchanges between persons who shared a close emotional tie while both were living: spouses, parents and children, siblings, and occasionally friends and other relatives.\nMost communications are \"intention\" calls, initiated by the deceased to impart a message, such as farewell upon death, a warning of impending danger, or information the living needs to carry out a task. For example, actress Ida Lupino's father, Stanley, who died intestate in London during World War II, called Lupino six months after his death to relate information concerning his estate, the location of some unknown but important papers.\nSome calls appear to have no other purpose than to make contact with the living; many of these occur on emotionally charged \"anniversary\" days, such as Mothers day or Fathers day, a birthday or holiday. In a typical\u201d anniversary\u201d call, the dead may do nothing more than repeat a phrase over and over, such as \"Hello, Mom, is that you?\"\nPersons who have received phone calls from the dead report that the voices are exactly the same as when the deceased was living, furthermore, the voice often uses pet names and words. The telephone usually rings normally, although some recipients say that the ring sounded flat and abnormal. In many cases, the connection is bad, with a great deal of static and line noise, and occasionally the faint voices of the other persons are heard, as though lines have been crossed. In many cases, the voice of the dead one is difficult to hear and grows fainter as the call goes on. Sometimes, the voice just fades away but the line remains open, and the recipient hangs up after giving up on further communication. Sometimes the call is terminated by the dead and the recipient hers the click of disengagement, other times, the line simply goes dead.\nThe phantom phone calls typically occur when the recipient is in a passive state of mind. If the recipient knows the caller is dead, the shock is great and the phone call very brief, invariably, the caller terminates the call after a few seconds or minutes, or the line goes dead. If the recipient does not know the caller is dead, a lengthy conversation of up to 30 minutes or so may take place, during which the recipient is not aware of anything amiss. In a minority of cases, the call is placed person-to-person, long-distance with the assistance of a mysterious operator. Checks with the telephone company later turn up no evidence of a call being places.\nSimilar phone calls from the dead are \"intention\" phone calls occurring between two living persons. Such calls are much rarer than calls from the dead. In a typical \"intention\" call, the caller thinks about making the call but never does, the recipient nevertheless receives a call. In some cases, emergencies precipitate phantom calls, a surgeon is summoned by a nurse to the hospital to perform an emergency operation, a priest is called by a \"relative\" to give last rites to a dying man and so forth.\nSome persons who claim to have had UFO encounters report receiving harassing phantom phone calls. The calls are received soon after the witness returns home, or within a day or two of the encounter, in many cases, the calls come before the witness has shared the experience with anyone, stranger still, they are often placed to unlisted phone numbers. The unidentified caller warns the witness not to talk and to \"forget\" what he or she saw.\nPhone calls allegedly may be placed to the dead as well. The caller does not find out until sometime after the call that the person on the other end has been dead. In one such case, a woman dreamed of a female friend she had not seen for several years. In the disturbing dream, she witnessed the friend sliding down into a pool of blood. Upon awakening, she worried that the dream was a portent of trouble, and called the friend. She was relieved when the friend answered. The friend explained that she had been in the hospital, had been released and was due to be readmitted in a few days. She demurred when the woman offered to visit, saying she would call later. The return call never came. The woman called her friend again, to be told by a relative that the friend has been dead for six months at the time the conversation took place.\nIn several cases studied by researchers, the deceased callers make reference to an anonymous\u201d they\u201d and caution that there is little time to talk. The remarks imply that communication between the living and the dead is not only difficult, but not necessarily desirable.\nMost phone calls from the dead occur within 24 hours of the death of the caller. Most short calls come from those who have been dead seven days or less: most lengthy calls come from those who have been dead several months. One of the longest death-intervals on record is two years.\nIn a small number of cases, the callers are strangers who say they are calling on behalf of a third party, whom the recipient later discovered is dead.\nSeveral theories exist as to the origin of phantom phone calls. (1) They are indeed placed by the dead, who somehow manipulate the telephone mechanisms and circuitry: (2) they are deceptions of elemental-type spirits who enjoy playing tricks on the living: (3) they are psychokinetic acts caused subconsciously by the recipient, whose intense desire to communicate with the dead creates a type of hallucinatory experience: (4) they are entirely fantasy created by the recipient.\nFor the most part, phantom phone calls are not seriously regarded by parapsychologists. In the early 20th century, numerous devices were built by investigators in hopes of capturing ghostly voices: many of them were modifications of the telegraph and wireless. Thomas Alva Edison, whose parents were Spiritualists, believed that a telephone could be invented that would connect the living to the dead. He verified that he was working on such a device, but apparently it never was completed before his death.\n\"Psychic telephone\" experiments were conducted in the 1940's in England and America. Interest in the phenomenon waned until the 1960\u2019s, following the findings of Konstantin Raudive that ghostly voices could be captured on electromagnetic tape.","id":"<urn:uuid:c6d4bada-2535-41ff-b2c6-f0357a52e392>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/phantomuniverse.blogspot.com\/2010\/02\/phone-calls-from-beyond.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9758814573,"token_count":1417,"score":2.59375,"int_score":3}
{"text":"H5N1 in cats\n8 March 2006\nAt the end of February 2006 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), caused by the H5N1 virus was detected in a domestic cat found dead on the northern island of Ruegen, Germany. Since mid-February, over 100 birds have died on this island and tests confirmed H5N1 infection. Also in Asia, cats and other felidae have been occasionally found to be infected with H5N1 since the start of the poultry epidemic in 2003. Experimental studies have shown that the domestic cat can become infected with the virus and that cat to cat transmission is possible in principle. The virus causes respiratory disease which can lead to death in all cat species. Serological studies in several Asian countries suggest that dogs may also contract the H5N1 infection. Countries in Europe have advised owners of pets living near H5N1 wild bird foci to keep cats indoors and dogs on a leash when taken for a walk.\nThese recent events lead to many questions by the public and pet owners to which the veterinary profession has to respond. In addition, there may be exposure of pet owners and veterinarians. For example, when animals infected with H5N1 (eg birds, dogs and cats) are brought to the veterinary clinic. Important are also the contribution veterinary practitioners can make in the surveillance of the disease for the presence of the H5N1 infection.\nThis section provides information for the general public and professionals about the risk of cats contracting H5N1 virus and the role of cats in the spread of avian influenza H5N1.\nDuring a H5N1 outbreak in poultry in 1997 in Hong Kong, the first clinical human cases of this sub-type were reported with several fatalities. From the end of 2003 to date (March 2006) 173 people have been confirmed infected with the H5N1 virus of which 93 have died. Except for 1 case, human-to-human transmission has probably not occurred. Although H5N1 is relatively common to wild birds and poultry, humans and other mammals are also at risk of HPAI infection. Highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry is of growing concern due to the current geographic extent comprising Asia, Africa and Europe showing potential for pandemic spread. The virus is highly contagious and already over 200 million domestic birds have either been culled or died of the disease. Table 1 shows the timeline for avian influenza in cats and other felidae.\n|Timeline of (H5N1) avian influenza in cats and other felidae (and civets)\n|1970s & 1980s\n||Research revealed that infection of domestic cats with influenza A subtypes H3N2 from humans, H7N3 from a turkey, and H7N7 from a harbor seal (Phoc vitulina) produces transient virus excretion and a temporary increase in body temperature but did not induce any other clinical signs of disease.\n||Two leopards and two tigers died at a zoo in Thailand after feeding on chicken carcasses. Investigation confirmed H5N1 in tissue samples from all 4 animals. This was the first report of influenza causing disease and death in big cats.\n||Research shows that domestic cats experimentally\ninfected with H5N1 develop severe disease and can spread\ninfection to other cats.\n||A H5N1 outbreak in zoo tigers in Thailand reportedly\nfed on chicken carcasses. Eventually, 147 out of the\npopulation of 441 tigers died or had to euthanized for\nanimal welfare reasons.\n||Tests on three civets that died late June 2005 in\nViet Nam revealed H5N1, marking the first infection\nof this species with the virus. These endangered Owston\u2019s\npalm civets were raised in captivity; source of infection\nis still unknown.\nOctober 05 February 06\n||FAO field veterinarians report unusual high cat mortality\nin Iraq and Indonesia in the vicinity of H5N1 outbreaks\n28 February 2006\n||H5N1 confirmed in a cat on the Baltic Sea island\nof Ruegen (Germany). Over 100 wild birds had been found\ndead on the island during previous weeks.\nRole of cats in virus transmission\nResearch has shown that domestic cats may die from H5N1 virus. Also horizontal transmission has been proven. However, it is unlikely that cats play a role in the natural transmission cycle of H5N1 viruses. Cat infections occasionally occur in association with H5N1 outbreaks in domestic or wild birds, e.g. when cats feed on infected birds. Experimental\/infected cats shed the virus via the respiratory and intestinal tract, and may therefore transmit the virus to other cats. Naturally infected cats are thus in theory, able to spread the virus.\nIn areas where H5N1 Infected wild birds are reported it can not be excluded that cats become infected. Although most wild birds infected are waterfowl, not normally the species cats interact with, H5N1 is potentially infectious to numerous other bird species and it can not be ruled out that passerines or pigeons which do interact with cats get infected.\nIn areas where poultry is infected with H5N1 there is a risk that cats become infected with H5N1 through contact with infected poultry or their faeces. Anecdotal reports support the notion that contact with infected poultry (faeces and eating infected carcasses) forms a source of infection for cats. Cats probably have little or no contribution to the spread of the disease because the number of infected poultry is much higher than the number of infected cats; poultry shed much more virus than cats. Nevertheless, cats may play a role in the spread of the virus to other animals. Report to the local veterinary authority any evidence of significant animal mortality both wild and domestic.\nTheoretically there is a possibility that cats transmit infection to humans. However, given the risk that cats become infected with HPAI is low, the risk to human infection is therefore limited.\nThe role of stray cats\nDue to their greater mobility, stray cats could spread the disease into new areas. If infected, stray cats may become a source of contamination to poultry and mammals, including humans.\nThe role of other mammals\nThe ability of catching the H5N1 virus is not restricted to cats. Reports show infection in tigers, leopards and civets. Also dogs and pigs may become infected with the virus. Given the broad host spectrum of the H5N1virus, the possibility that also other wild or domesticated mammals including seals, mustelidae or furbearing animals, become infected by contacting infected animals is present. All carnivores could become infected through eating infected poultry or infected wild birds.\nAreas where H5N1 HPAI has been diagnosed or is suspected in poultry or wild birds:\n- Report to the local veterinary authority any evidence of significant bird mortality both wild and domestic.\n- Be especially vigilant for any dead or sick cats and report such findings to the local veterinarian.\n- Make sure contact between cats and wild birds or poultry (or their faeces) is avoided and\/or keep cats inside.\n- If cats bring a sick or dead bird inside the house, put on plastic gloves and dispense of the bird in plastic bags for collection by local veterinary animal handlers.\n- Keep stray cats outside the house and avoid contact with them.\n- If cats show breathing problems or nasal discharge, a veterinarian should be consulted.\n- Do not touch or handle any sick-looking or dead cat (or other animal) and report to the authorities.\n- Wash hands with water and soap regularly and especially after handling animals and cleaning their litter boxes or coming in contact with faeces or saliva.\n- Dogs can only be taken outside the premises if kept restraint.\n- Do not feed any water birds.\n- Disinfect (e.g. with bleach 2-3 %) cages or other hardware in which sick animals have been transported or been in contact.\n- Wash animal blankets with soap or any other commercial detergent.","id":"<urn:uuid:06c69d70-74bb-44ae-8b88-d574a02ebd03>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.fao.org\/avianflu\/en\/wildlife\/wild_animals.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9348472357,"token_count":1671,"score":2.890625,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Gluten Free Facts\nWhat is gluten?\nGluten is the protein found in wheat, barley, rye and related wheat species such as spelt and kamut. It helps baked goods keep their form and chewy texture and is also added to other food items more and more, both for consistency and taste purposes.\nHelpful Hint: Buckwheat, contrary to its name, is not actually wheat and does not contain gluten.\nWhat foods contain gluten?\nThe obvious foods that contain gluten include foods made from a flour base. Wheat, barley, and rye based breads, cookies, pastries, and bagels all contain gluten. However, hidden sources of gluten are abundant in many packaged goods from soy sauce to spice mixes, to breath mints. More and more companies are voluntarily labeling their products as gluten free and some even go through a gluten free certification process.\nHere is a short list of foods that can have hidden gluten:\n- Luncheon meat\n- Blue cheese\n- Gravy and gravy powder\n- Baked beans\n- Self basting turkeys\n- Seasoning Mixes\n- Instant coffee\n- Brown rice syrup\n- Potato chips\n- Soy sauce\n- Hot Chocolate\n- Salad dressings\n- Curry powder\n- White pepper\n- Malt vinegar\n- Breath mints\n- Oats (while naturally gluten free, there is a risk of contamination through harvesting, milling, and processing; Udi\u2019s only uses certified gluten free oats) (1) (2)\nFor a full list of unsafe ingredients, click here:\nWho should eat a gluten free diet?\nSome people must eat a gluten free diet because they\u2019ve been diagnosed with Celiac Disease or Gluten Sensitivity, in which the only cure is a gluten free diet. Others eat gluten free because they suspect gluten is causing them undesirable symptoms that they wish to avoid. Still others have learned that gluten can cause inflammation and therefore they seek to eliminate it from their diet. No matter what your situation, a gluten free lifestyle may be of benefit to you.\nWho can get Celiac Disease or have a Gluten Sensitivity?\nThe short answer is: anyone. Some are more predisposed to have this disease or intolerance than others, especially if a family member has been diagnosed. It has been noted that northern European countries, specifically Nordic countries, as well as Italy and Ireland have a higher rate of Celiac Disease, and approximately 1 out of every 133 Americans have Celiac Disease. (7)\nWhat is Celiac Disease?\nCeliac Disease is an autoimmune disorder where gluten triggers the immune system to attack the lining of the small intestine. Over time, Celiac Disease can cause malabsorption, leading to a wide range of health problems such as iron and mineral deficiencies, osteoporosis, liver disease, infertility, neurological disorders, and even some forms of cancer. (3, 4)\nFor more information, click here:\nCeliac Disease and Diabetes\nAbout 1% of the total population has celiac disease. It is more common in people with type 1 diabetes. An estimated 10% of people with type 1 diabetes also have celiac disease.\nFor more information, click here:\nWhat is Gluten Anyway and Where Is It?\nBy Danna Korn, Living Gluten Free for Dummies, 2nd edition\nGluten has a couple of definitions; one is technically correct but not commonly used, and the other is commonly used but not technically correct. Here\u2019s the common definition: Gluten is a mixture of proteins in wheat, rye, and barley. Oats don\u2019t have gluten, but may be contaminated, so they\u2019re forbidden on a strict gluten-free diet, too.\nYou can find lots of information about what you can and can\u2019t eat on a gluten-free diet at www.celiac.com or other websites. But you need to have a general idea of what kinds of food have gluten in them so you know what to avoid. Foods with flour in them (white or wheat) are the most common culprits when you\u2019re avoiding gluten. The following are obvious gluten-glomming foods:\n- Cookies, cakes, and most other baked goods\nBut along with these culprits come not-so-obvious suspects too, like licorice, many (read \u2018most\u2019) cereals, and natural flavorings. When you\u2019re gluten-free, you get used to reading labels, calling manufacturers, and digging a little deeper to know for sure what you can and can\u2019t eat.\nYou have to do without these foods, but you really don\u2019t have to do without. There\u2019s a subtle but encouraging difference.

{"text":"Common Core Catholic Identity Initiative\nA national working group has begun the Common Core Catholic Identity Initiative (CCCII) to develop and disseminate resources and guidelines to assist Catholic elementary and secondary schools in integrating elements of Catholic identity (Catholic values, Scripture, Church social teachings, encyclicals, etc.) into curriculum and instruction based on the Common Core State Standards.\nThe initial phase of CCCII focuses on K-8 English\/Language Arts\/ Literacy. Resources for other subjects and for 9-12 curriculum will be developed in later phases.\nForty-six states have agreed to adopt the Common Core State Standards, a set of high quality K-12 learning standards that includes rigorous content and application of knowledge using higher-order thinking skills, leading students to college and career readiness. Currently, Catholic schools are assessing what the implications of the standards and accompanying assessments may be for them.\nWhile Catholic schools have their own local or diocesan standards, their ability to continue to provide high-quality education for their students is compelling them to consider adoption of the common core standards. Catholic schools will be impacted as curriculum resources and professional development opportunities become aligned with Common Core State Standards by producers of instructional materials, college teacher preparation programs, or regulations for participation in the federal programs that currently benefit their students and teachers. Within this environment, maintaining the uniqueness and integrity of the Catholic school will require integrating the demands of their mission and the academic expectations of their constituents and the wider education community.\nTo assist Catholic schools with enhancing Catholic identity integrated into the curriculum, the Common Core Catholic Identity Initiative (CCCII) has been launched as a collaborative project involving Catholic universities, corporations and sponsors invested in Catholic education, and the National Catholic Educational Association (NCEA).\nThe Common Core Catholic Identity Initiative has two goals:\n- to empower Catholic schools and dioceses to design and direct the implementation of the Common Core standards within the culture and context of a Catholic school curriculum\n- to infuse the Common Core standards with the faith\/principles\/values\/social justice themes inherent in the mission and Catholic identity of the school.\nThe CCCII project aims to accomplish its goals by creating a process and a product:\nPhase 1: Gather approximately 35 practitioners and curriculum and catechetics experts to pilot a CCCII ELA Unit development process to be shared with the larger Catholic educational community. (June 2012)\nPhase 2: Revise and refine the unit development process so that it can be replicated in dioceses around the country.\nPhase 3: Invite participation in development of additional CCCII ELA Units by Catholic educators around the country.\nPhase 1: Utilize the expertise and strength of experienced and innovative teachers to develop complete units\/exemplars that join Catholic identify with the Common Core curriculum standards. Utilize the expertise of CCCII leaders to develop supporting resources and guidelines. (June 2012)\nPhase 2: Post exemplar units, guidelines, and resources developed in for the June 2012 launch for open access by Catholic educators on the Catholic School Standards Project Website www.catholicschoolsstandards.org) . (July 2012)\nPhase 3: Expand exemplar units and Catholic Identity resources available for use by local Catholic schools.\nTailor the CCCII Unit development process for Catholic secondary schools.\nExpand CCCII to include additional subject areas.\nMeet the CCCII Leadership and Planning Teams","id":"<urn:uuid:1f81392d-3957-4ac5-9659-ed3112273a06>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/catholicschoolstandards.org\/common-core-catholic-identity-initiative","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9384240508,"token_count":703,"score":3.375,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Facilitator's Guide for\nTHE BELOVED COMMUNITY\nA film by Pamela Calvert\/Plain Speech\nAt the fenceline of Canada's \"Chemical Valley,\" girls\nare being born at twice the rate of boys. How do you stay in the home\nyou love when the price you pay may be your children's future?\nPLANNING A SCREENING\nTopics and Issues Relevant to THE BELOVED COMMUNITY\nAs you plan your screening, you might consider speakers, panelists, or\ndiscussion leaders who have expertise in one or more of the following\n- Children's Health\n- Community Organizing\n- Corporate Social Responsibility\n- Endocrine Disruptors\n- Environmental Justice\n- Green Chemistry\n- Human Rights\n- Native Culture, History & Land Rights\n- Precautionary Principle\n- Reproductive Health\n- Toxic Exposure & Health Impacts\n- Workplace Health and Safety\nAs You Plan Your Event\nA screening of THE BELOVED COMMUNITY can be used to spark interest\nin any of the topics listed above, as well as to inspire individual and\ncommunity action. Using the checklist below will help ensure a high quality\nand high impact event.\nSet realistic goals.\nWill you host a single screening or use the film to spur ongoing efforts?\nWill you steer a panel or discussion toward a specific topic or let the\nparticipants pursue whatever issues they choose? Be sure to include your\nevent partners in the decision making process. Being clear about your\ngoals will make it much easier to structure the event, target publicity,\nand evaluate results.\nStructure your event to match your goals.\nDo you need an outside facilitator? If your goal is to share information\nbeyond what is included in the film, are there local experts on the topic\nwho should be present? How many participants do you want? (Large groups\nare appropriate for information exchange. Small groups allow for more\nintensive dialogue and action plans.)\nArrange to involve all stakeholders.\nIt is especially important that people be allowed to speak for themselves.\nWe encourage you to seek out 'unlikely alliances' and push your own comfort\nzone, going out of your way to invite representatives of all the constituencies\nwith a potential stake in building a healthy and sustainable community.\nOnce the group is assembled, make sure that all participants have a chance\nto be heard and are treated with respect.\nChoose an accessible venue.\nIf you are bringing together different constituencies, is your venue 'neutral\nterritory'? Is it in a part of town that is reachable by various kinds\nof transportation? Does the physical configuration of the room allow for\nthe kind of discussion you hope to have? Can everyone easily see the screen\nand hear the film? Is the room comfortable?\nLeave time for feelings.\nWhen the lights come up, people may have a strong emotional response to\nthe film. This is where people make the empathetic connections that make\nall the following work possible, so it's important to encourage that personal\nresponse before moving on to questions of strategy. The conversation will\nnaturally flow into \"What do we do now?\"\nLeave time to plan for action.\nIf you want your screening to have lasting impact, it is important to\nleave time to plan action. People will be looking for something that is\nimmediate, concrete, and local. Planning next steps can help people leave\nthe room feeling energized and optimistic, even when the discussion has\nbeen difficult. It's also important to be prepared to facilitate networking.\nProvide a sign-in sheet at the door so people can share contact information\nlike email addresses. Let participants know exactly how that information\nwill (and won't) be shared. Let participants know whether or not press\nwill be present.\nFacilitating a Discussion of THE BELOVED COMMUNITY\nPeople who feel safe, encouraged, respected and challenged are likely\nto share openly and thoughtfully. As a facilitator you can encourage that\nkind of participation. Here's how:\nView the film before your event. This will both give yourself time to\nreflect so you aren't dealing with raw emotions at the same time that\nyou are trying to facilitate a discussion, as well as letting you check\nthe DVD and equipment to make sure there are no technical glitches. You\nmay want to refer to the Discussion Guide\nto get you started.\nYou don't need to be an expert on globalization or environmental justice\nto lead an event, but knowing the basics can help you keep a discussion\non track and gently correct misstatements of fact. Prior to your event,\ntake time to check the Background Information and Suggested Resources\nin the film guide handout.\nBe clear about your role.\nBeing a facilitator is not the same as being a teacher. A teacher's job\nis to convey specific information. In contrast, a facilitator remains\nneutral, helping move the discussion along without imposing her or his\nviews on the dialogue.\nKnow who might be present.\nIt isn't always possible to know exactly who might attend a screening,\nbut if you know what kinds of groups are present in your community, you\nmight be able to predict who might be represented. You can also keep in\nmind that issues can play out very differently for different groups of\npeople. Factors like geography, age, race, religion and class can all\nhave an impact on comfort levels, speaking styles and prior knowledge.\nTake care not to assume that all members of a particular group share the\nsame point of view.\nBELOVED COMMUNITY is a co-production of Plain Speech and Detroit\nPublic Television, and is distributed by California\nNewsreel.

{"text":"Special thanks to our guest blogger, Chris Myers, U.S. Space and Rocket Center\u00ae, Huntsville, AL for this post\nBringing the Cosmos to Space Camp\u00ae!\nAt the U.S. Space and Rocket Center\u00ae and Space Camp, we are constantly looking for fun and innovative ways to teach our museum guests and trainees about space history and the science and math concepts that surround it. Naturally, we were excited to participate in the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics series of instructional webinars in order to get some fresh ideas and content. The creativity started to flow as we reviewed the background material, but the amount and quality of the lesson plans and information presented to us by Mary Dussault and Erin Braswell was impressive. By the end of the first hour of the webinar, we had solid ideas and lesson plans that could be implemented in every program from summer Day Camp for 5-year-olds to Advanced Space Academy\u00ae for high-school seniors. And they meet both state and national curriculum guidelines! In this case, our target subject was astronomy.\nFor our younger trainees, we adapted the activities that dealt with colors and filters into a hands-on component for our astronomy briefing \u201cTenacious Telescopes.\u201d We use PVC pipe, colored felt and theater lighting gel in the primary colors to teach the trainees about how real telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope use filters to look for specific information, and how scientists can put these single-color images together to make a full-color picture. In addition to making it look more like a real telescope, mounting the color filter inside a PVC pipe telescope has the added bonus of keeping our filters fingerprint and wrinkle free.\nFor our Advanced Academy (junior high to high school) trainees, we added an image processing component into our existing astronomy curriculum which is made up of four components. At the beginning of the week, the trainees participate in a lecture called \u201cExploring the Night Sky\u201d where they learn the basics of astronomy and focus on finding and naming the constellations and deep space objects. Our second astronomy block is the \u201cMicro Observatory Lab,\u201d where our trainees use the Mobs software to compile full-color images of deep space objects. Our third astronomy block is a \u201cNight Telescope\u201d activity, where the trainees use real telescopes to find the same objects in the sky of which they compiled images the day before. And for our final astronomy block, our Advanced Academy trainees learn the stories behind selected constellations in our inflatable Star Lab.\nWe have been running the \u201cMicro Observatory Lab\u201d astronomy block since December, 2011, and have had more than 1,500 trainees from all over the world participate. We have so many students participating that we aren\u2019t able to display all their artwork at once, so we have set up two small rotating exhibits of 12 featured photos each here at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center, one located in the Main Museum and the other located in the Science Lab used for our summer Space Academy for Educators\u00ae camp, and we plan to add a third, larger display to our computer lab this summer.\nThese kinds of seminars and programs are what make it so awesome to be a part of the network of Smithsonian Affiliates. Imagine all the fun, innovative and educational activities you can dream up with the help of these services! So get out there and sign up for a class today!

{"text":"The Physics Help Forum not working today, at least not from my ISP, so this goes here. It's basically a math deal anyway:\nThe formula to calculate the force of a point of mass, let's call them planets, that results from its being gravitationally attracted by another point of mass is Newton's:\nWhere is the force of the planet that results from the gravitational attraction exerted upon it by the other planet, is Newton's gravity constant, and are the respecive masses of the planets, and d is the distance between them.\nFor simplicity's sake let's say all the planets considered are of the same mass, so we can write instead of .\nNow, if I'm not mistaken, the formula for calculating the force of a planet resulting from the gravitational attraction of more than two planets is:\nWhere is the force on the jth planet resulting from the gravitational attraction of the other planets, and is the distance between the jth planet and the kth planet.\nMy question is \"where is the vector addition?\" That is, when considering the force on one planet that results from the gravitational attraction of many other planets, we have to take into account not only the distance of the other planets from planet j but also their position with respect to it (right?).\nTake for example the simple case of three planets in the same plane. Planet j is at the origin. Planet k is one unit to the right of j on the x axis, while planet l is one unit up the y axis. If the masses all equal 1, then, by the formula above, the force on planet j would be:\nBut is a function of both the distance and the position, right? So we must consider not only the Gravitational Forces individually exerted upon j by k and l, but also the angle at which these forces are exerted. That is, we must add the vectors. To add vectors you just plug in the x value and y value sums of the added vectors into pythagoras' formula. The force on planet j should therefore be:\n(Where is the angle subtended by a line drawn from planet j to planet x. I.e. and )\nSo, what am I missing here?

Seen globally, transport is one of the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Yet fossil fuels are becoming scarce, will become increasingly expensive and will eventually stop being viable as transport fuels. Before this happens, climate change will have begun to have a serious impact on human lives. The authors believe that it is crucial to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy as soon as possible, especially in the transport sector. Making urban transport independent of fossil fuel is a great challenge, but the authors cite growing evidence that it can be achieved.\nContributing Partner: UNT Libraries","id":"<urn:uuid:5579e9d4-6e68-4bcf-87a3-ff20ed6954c4>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/digital.library.unt.edu\/explore\/partners\/UNT\/browse\/?fq=str_location_country%3AChina&fq=str_location_country%3ADenmark&fq=str_location_country%3AAustralia","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9270371795,"token_count":137,"score":3.34375,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Dropping a pound or two isn't necessarily a bad thing, especially if your pet's packing a few extra. But weight loss should be controlled, gradual and supervised by your veterinarian. Sudden, unexpected weight loss usually signals an underlying health problem. Cats, in particular, need frequent weight monitoring to prevent hepatic lipidosis, a debilitating liver disease.\nSome pets lose weight in the heat of summer when rising temperatures curb their appetite. At the other extreme, you'll find some pets losing weight during frigid weather because they're burning more energy while trying to keep warm. Other common causes of weight loss include stress and lactation.\nHealthy boarded pets may shed some pounds because of diet changes or the stress of a new environment, and nursing mothers burn more calories as their bodies produce milk. Although normal, these responses to environmental or lifestyle changes mean your pet uses and needs, more calories to meet increased energy requirements. Diet plays a crucial role in weight maintenance. Undernourishment and weight loss occur in pets who are fed poor-quality, inedible or spoiled food. Many underlying medical conditions such as dental disease, gastrointestinal disorders (including parasites), diabetes mellitus, liver or kidney disease, congestive heart failure and cancer make eating and absorbing nutrients difficult.\nOther conditions, including hyperthyroidism, fever and chronic infections, increase your pet's metabolism and the rate she burns calories. The result can be dramatic weight loss.\nWhat You Can Do at Home\nA nutritious diet and lots of fresh water are your pet's best defenses against unwanted weight loss. Feed your pet the right amount of high-quality food that's appropriate for her life stage and activity level. And make sure she visits the veterinarian at least once a year for a thorough examination and parasite prevention.\nWhen to Call the Veterinarian\nSee your veterinarian whenever your pet experiences unexplained weight loss. Call the doctor immediately if your pet exhibits additional symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, fever or increased thirst or urination.\nLiterally hundreds of conditions can cause weight loss in pets, so please be patient as the veterinarian makes his or her diagnosis.\nThough some of these conditions are serious, most pets who have slimmed down quickly, soon return to their original weight with no complications.","id":"<urn:uuid:683b563f-f9b9-4efb-8733-5c0a1f58a8b9>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.petco.com\/Content\/ArticleList\/Article\/12\/2\/2126\/Weight-Loss.aspx","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9345487356,"token_count":458,"score":3.046875,"int_score":3}

{"text":"LABDIEN [Hello]! My name is Hannah Rosenthal, and I am the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism at the U.S. Department of State. In Latvian, envoy means \u201c\u012apa\u0161\u0101 s\u016btne\u201d. Thank you for inviting me here today to speak to you about the importance of diversity and respect for others. I am always eager to speak to young students because so much of my work depends on your help.\nAs the Special Envoy, it is my job to monitor anti-Semitic incidents and combat such intolerance. \u201cAnti-Semitism\u201d simply means hatred for Jewish people. I monitor anti-Semitic incidents such as vandalism of religious places, anti-Semitic speech, and even violence against Jews.\nBut the truth is, I am in the relationship-building business. I am here today to tell you that young people and students can have an impact and do what I do. We must all share and strive for the same mission: to combat hate and intolerance to create a more peaceful and just world.\nIn order to fight hatred, we must begin with respecting the dignity of every individual, regardless of his or her beliefs. In fact, our differences make us human. You may have heard about the concept of the \u201cOther,\u201d or in Latvian, \u201csve\u0161inieks\u201d. There are individuals in this world who would like us to view some people as outside the larger human family.\nThe desire to stamp out or suppress or ostracize certain individuals because of who they are, how they worship, or who they love is an obstacle for all members of society. Intolerance prevents us from creating a just and peaceful society. Meanwhile, we, as society, must not stand by idly. When we stand by passively, we also pay a price.\nTerrible things can happen when intolerance and racism take hold in a society, across a continent. Hitler\u2019s Nazi ideology called for racial purity and targeted the Jews as an Other that needed to be exterminated. Some of you may know that yesterday communities around the world observed Yom HaShoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day. Yom HaShoah is a day to remember the victims of the Holocaust and to commemorate the individuals \u2013 including some Latvians -- who risked their lives to save the Jews. I understand Latvia has its own official Holocaust Remembrance Day on July 4. While we officially commemorate the Holocaust on these days, we must carry their lessons with us every day. We must stand against attitudes that value some individuals below others. We must expand the circle of rights and opportunities to all people \u2013 advancing their freedoms and possibilities.\nIntolerance is a moral, a political, and a social problem. But it is also a solvable one. It is not unchangeable. We are not born hating. Somewhere we learn to hate. We can, in fact, make hatred and intolerance something of the past. But this demands our attention. It\u2019s not easy work, but it is urgent work.\nAt the U.S. Department of State (which is like the Foreign Ministry in Latvia) I work within the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. The primary and overarching goal of the Bureau is to promote freedom and democracy and protect human rights around the world. We are constantly strengthening our policies and pushing ourselves and others to break down former walls of intolerance. Over the past three years, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has made the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people \u2013 \u201cLGBT\u201d in shorthand -- a priority of our human rights policy. As Secretary Clinton emphatically stated, \u201cGay rights are human rights and human rights are gay rights.\u201d\nIn the United States, we are inspired by the idea that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. The United States has a strong multi-ethnic heritage. Over the course of centuries, many people have immigrated to the United States in hopes of a better life with more opportunities. We embrace this diversity and continue to uphold these values in our everyday lives, actions and laws.\nI am learning that Latvia too has a diverse and multicultural history. Various tribes -- the Livs, the Letts, and the Cours -- lived here for many centuries. People from Belarus, Germany, Russia, Sweden, Ukraine, and many other places have played an important part in Latvia\u2019s history. Jews have also contributed to Latvia\u2019s heritage since the sixteenth century. In the eighteenth century, a Jewish man named Abraham Kuntze invented the famous Rigas Balzam (Latvia\u2019s signature liquor). Latvia\u2019s Jews backed the independence movement in the early twentieth century, with hundreds volunteering for service in the Latvian Army and fighting heroically during the war for independence. Latvia\u2019s Jews thrived during the independence period of the 1920s and 30s, serving in parliament and helping write Latvia\u2019s constitution. Zigfrids Meierovics, the first Foreign Minister of Latvia, and twice Prime Minister, had a Jewish father.\nSadly, when the Soviets arrived in Latvia in 1940, they shut down Jewish institutions and seized Jews\u2019 property. When the Soviets deported tens of thousands of Latvians to Siberia, hundreds of Latvian Jews were deported as well. And then, just over one year later, the Holocaust followed and approximately 70,000 of Latvia\u2019s Jews \u2013 almost 90 percent \u2013 were murdered by the Nazis and their accomplices.\nAnd yet, the Jewish people survived in Latvia. In the 1980s and 90s, Latvia\u2019s Jews once again supported Latvian independence from the Soviet Union, lending their efforts to those of the Popular Front of Latvia. Jews stood on the barricades in 1991. Today, Jews \u2013 along with all other Latvians -- are free to practice their faith and to celebrate their culture in a free Latvia. Latvian society is richer, and more diverse, because of the contributions of all these people.\nOf course, neither Latvia, nor the United States, is perfect. There are people in both of our countries who do not believe in diversity and respect in every society. However, if we condemn their words of hate, we can spread the message of dignity and respect.\nAnti-Semitism and other forms of hatred attack the very idea that every individual is born free and equal in dignity and rights. But Jews, Christians, Muslims and all religious communities are all part of the same family we call humanity. As a child of a Holocaust survivor, anti-Semitism is something very personal to me. My father was arrested \u2013 on Kristallnacht, the unofficial pogrom that many think started the Holocaust \u2013 and sent with many fellow Jews to prison and then to the Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany. And he was the lucky one \u2013 every other person in his family was murdered at Auschwitz. I have dedicated my life to eradicating anti-Semitism and intolerance with a sense of urgency and passion that only my father could give me.\nAt the State Department, we are trying to make human rights a human reality. As the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism, I have recognized that this will not be possible without the help of you, our youth and future leaders.\nLast year my colleague Farah Pandith, the Special Representative to Muslims Communities, and I launched a virtual campaign called \u201c2011 Hours Against Hate,\u201d using Facebook. Perhaps you have heard of it? We are asking you, young people around the world, to pledge a number of hours to volunteer to help or serve a population different than their own. We ask that you work with people who may look different, or pray differently or live differently. For example, a young Jew might volunteer time to read books at a Muslim pre-school, or a Russian Orthodox at a Jewish clinic, or a Muslim at a Baha\u2019i food pantry, or a straight woman at an LGBT center. We want to encourage YOU to walk a mile in another person\u2019s shoes. And while our goal was to get 2011 hours pledged, at the end of last year youth all over the world had pledged tens of thousands of hours.\nThe campaign was, in fact, so successful that we continued it into 2012. Thanks to a group of British non-governmental organizations, we are now also partnering with the London Olympic and Paralympic Games! In January, the London Olympic and Paralympics approved our application to have 2012 Hours Against Hate branded with the Olympics logo. We can now leverage the energy surrounding the 2012 Olympics to encourage athletes and fans alike to participate in combating hate and pledging their time to help or serve someone who is different from them.\nFarah and I have met hundreds of young people \u2013 students and young professionals \u2013 in Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia. They want to DO something. And I have a feeling that YOU want to DO something too. Last summer, Farah and I met with youth and interfaith leaders in Jordan, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia, and discussed reaching out to others, increasing tolerance and understanding among different religious groups, and addressed intolerance in their textbooks and lessons. Last month we traveled to Albania to encourage students from Tirana University and the local Madrasah to participate in 2012 Hours Against Hate. We held a panel discussion on the importance of religious diversity, and encouraged Albanian youth to live up to their country\u2019s important legacy of acceptance and courage: Albania was the only country that saved all of its Jews during the Holocaust. Really, we have just begun.\nSo while I fight anti-Semitism, I am also aware that hate is hate. Nothing justifies it \u2013 not economic instability, not international events, not isolated incidents of hate.\nSince the beginning of humankind, hate has been around, but since then too, good people of all faiths and backgrounds have worked to combat it. The Jewish tradition tells us that \u201cyou are not required to complete the task, but neither are you free to desist from it.\u201d\nTogether, we must confront and combat the many forms of hatred in our world today. Where there is hatred born of ignorance, we must teach and inspire. Where there is hatred born of blindness, we must expose people to a larger world of ideas and reach out, especially to youth, so they can see beyond their immediate circumstances. Where there is hatred whipped up by irresponsible leaders, we must call them out and answer as strongly as we can \u2013 and make their message totally unacceptable to all people of conscience.\nThank you again for inviting me here to speak to you today. I am now happy and excited to answer your questions.","id":"<urn:uuid:98ec614b-daef-452c-9e5b-ae03965de10f>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.state.gov\/j\/drl\/rls\/rm\/2012\/189162.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9629838467,"token_count":2200,"score":2.90625,"int_score":3}

{"text":"After the British Pyrrhic (costly) victory at Bunker Hill in 1775, British General William Howe decided a lethal blow needed to be delivered to the Patriot cause. Howe proposed to launch an attack on New York City using tens thousands of troops. He began mobilizing the massive fleet in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Meanwhile, American Commander-in-Chief George Washington had ordered General Charles Lee to prepare for the defense of the city. That June, Howe and 9,000 troops set sail for New York. Howe\u2019s army was to be met in the city by additional regiments of German and British troops. Reinforcements from Halifax led by Howe\u2019s brother would follow them.\nHowe\u2019s initial fleet arrived in New York Harbor and began landing troops on Staten Island. On April 27, 1776, British forces engaged the Americans at the Battle of Brooklyn Heights (also called the Battle of Long Island). Howe\u2019s army successfully outflanked Washington\u2019s, eventually causing the Patriots, after some resistance, to withdraw to Manhattan under the cover of darkness, thereby avoiding a potentially costly siege at the hands of the British.\nAfter failed peace negotiations, the British Army next struck at Lower Manhattan, where 12,000 British troops quickly overtook the city. Most of the Continental Army had retreated to defensible positions at Harlem Heights and then to White Plains, well north of the city, but some soldiers remained at Fort Washington in Manhattan. Howe\u2019s army chased Washington and the Continental Army into positions north of White Plains before returning to Manhattan. In Manhattan, Howe set his sights on Fort Washington, the last Patriot stronghold in Manhattan. In the furious, three-pronged attacked, British forces easily took the fort, capturing nearly 3,000 American prisoners and at least 34 cannons in the process. Most of the prisoners were taken to squalid British prison ships where all but 800 or so died of disease or starvation. General Washington, now at Fort Lee, directly across the Hudson River from Fort Washington, witnessed the events that happened. Following the fall of Fort Washington, British forces ferried up the Hudson River in barges toward Fort Lee. Washington ordered the evacuation of the fort\u2019s 2,000 soldiers across the Hackensack River at New Bridge Landing. Washington would lead his army clear across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania.\nFollowing the events in and around New York City, the outlook was bleak for the Continental Army. Morale in the army was extremely low, enlistments were ending, and desertions were commonplace. Even General Washington admitted his army\u2019s chances of success were slim. Meanwhile, General Howe ordered his army into their winter quarters that December and established several outposts from New York City south to New Brunswick, New Jersey.","id":"<urn:uuid:d9f94478-8f2d-45d3-b081-710593609b23>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/mrnussbaum.com\/history-2-2\/new_york_battles\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9620220065,"token_count":564,"score":4.0,"int_score":4}
{"text":"Free the Cans! Working Together to Reduce Waste\nIn a blog about how people share, it\u2019s worth the occasional reference to the bizarre ways that people DON\u2019T SHARE. Is it safe to say we live in a society that places great value on independence, private property, personal space, and privacy? Even sometimes extreme value? Is that why people at an 8-unit apartment building in Oakland, CA have separate caged stalls for eight separate trash cans? I know it\u2019s not nice to stare, but I walked by these incarcerated cans and could not help myself. I returned with my camera, so that I could share my question with the world: Why can\u2019t people share trash cans or a single dumpster? Or, at the very least, why can\u2019t the cans share driveway space?\nThe Zero Waste Movement has come to the Bay Area and it calls for a new use for these eight cages. Here are my suggestions:\n- Turn two of those cages into compost bins. Fill one with grass, leaves, and vegetable scraps, let it decompose for six months, then start filling the second bin in the meantime.\n- Put in a green can, which is what Oakland uses to collect milk cartons, pizza boxes, yard trimmings, and all food to send it to the municipal composting facility. If your city doesn\u2019t do this yet, tell them it\u2019s a great idea and they could be as cool and cutting edge as Oakland.\n- Put in one or two recycling cans for glass, plastic, cardboard, paper, aluminum, etc.\n- Put out a FREE STUFF box for unwanted clothing and household items. The neighbors could sort through it each week, and later put it out on the curb for passers-by to explore. Take what\u2019s left to Goodwill or a comparable donation spot.\n- Put in a few small bins for various items that can be recycled, such asbatteries and electronics, which can then be taken to an electronics recycling center every month or two. Styrofoam can be brought to a local packaging store or ceramics business that accepts used packaging material. Or, if you accumulate a bunch of plastic bags,take them to a store or to some other place that accepts used ones.\n- Put in ONE trash can. By the time you compost, recycle, re-use, redistribute, and take a few other measures to reduce your waste, you\u2019ll have almost no trash each week.\n- Install a bicycle rack or locked bicycle cage.\n- With the leftover space, put in a container garden and a bench where neighbors can gather and chat. A much more pleasant alternative to the garbage can jailhouse ambiance, wouldn\u2019t you agree?","id":"<urn:uuid:c970d9a2-a5ce-4050-9ea3-58d7bbd609a8>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/sharingsolution.com\/2009\/05\/23\/free-the-cans-working-together-to-reduce-waste\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9323602319,"token_count":575,"score":2.8125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"The bacterium Micavibrio aeruginosavorus (yellow), leeching\non a Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterium (purple).\nWhat\u2019s the news: If bacteria had blood, the predatory microbe Micavibrio aeruginosavorus would essentially be a vampire: it subsists by hunting down other bugs, attaching to them, and sucking their life out. For the first time, researchers have sequenced the genome of this strange microorganism, which was first identified decades ago in sewage water. The sequence will help better understand the unique bacterium, which has potential to be used as a \u201cliving antibiotic\u201d due to its ability to attack drug-resistant biofilms and its apparent fondness for dining on pathogens.\nAnatomy of a Vampire:\n- The bacterium has an interesting multi-stage life history. During its migratory phase it sprouts a single flagellum and goes hunting for prey. Once it find a delectable morsel of bacterium, it attacks and irreversibly attaches to the surface, and sucks out all of the good stuff: carbohydrates, amino acids, proteins, DNA, etc.\n- Sated, the cell divides in two via binary fission, and the now-depleted host is left for dead.\nHungry for Pathogens:\n- M. aeruginosavorus cannot be grown by itself; it must be cultured along with another bacteria to feed upon. A 2006 study found that it only grew upon three bacterial species, all of which can cause pneumonia-like disease in humans. A more recent study showed that it can prey upon a wider variety of microbes, most of them potentially pathogenic, like E. coli.\n- These studies also found that M. aeruginosavorus has a knack for disrupting biofilms, the dense collection of bacteria that cause harmful plaques on teeth and medical implants alike, and can be up to 1,000 more resistant to antibiotics than free-swimming bugs.\n- The bacteria can also swim through viscous fluids like mucous and kills Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the bacterium that can colonize lungs of cystic fibrosis patients and form a glue-like film.\n- These qualities have caught the eye of researchers who think it could be used as a living antibiotic to treat biofilms and various types of drug-resistant bacteria, which are a growing problem in medicine. Sequencing the organism\u2019s genome is an important step in understanding its biochemistry and how it preys on other microbes.\nClues From the Vampire Code:\n- The new study found that each phase of life involves the use (or expression) of different sets of genes. The migratory\/hunting phase involves many segments that code for flagellum formation and genes involved in quorum sensing. The attachment phase involves a wide variety of secreted chemicals and enzymes that facilitate the flow of materials from the host.\n- Micavibrio aeruginosavorus possesses no genes for amino acid transporters, a rather rare trait only seen in a few other bacterial species that depend heavily upon their host to help them shuttle these vital protein building-blocks. This absence helps explain the bacterium\u2019s dependence on a narrow range of prey, from which it directly steals amino acids. Although it remains unclear exactly how the microbe attaches to and infiltrates other cells.\nThe Future Holds:\n- The range of microbes upon which Micavibrio aeruginosavorus can survive is expanding; after being kept in laboratory conditions for years it has apparently evolved a more diverse diet. If this expansion continues, that could be a real problem for its use as an antibiotic; it could begin to eat beneficial gut bacteria, for example.\n- Researchers claim it is harmless to friendly gut microbes, but it hasn\u2019t been tested on all the varieties of bacteria present in humans.\n- Several important steps must be taken before testing in people, like learning more about what traits makes another bacteria tasty to Micavibrio aeruginosavorus. Researchers speculate the bacterium may need to be genetically altered in order to go after specific pathogens, or to reduce the risk of it causing unforeseen complications.\nReference: Zhang Wang, Daniel E Kadouri, Martin Wu.

{"text":"Download source - 8 Kb\nThis tutorial is based off of the MSDN Article #ID: Q194873. But, for a beginner, following these MSDN articles can be intimidating to say the least. One of the most often asked questions I see as a Visual C++ and Visual Basic programmer is how to call a VB DLL from VC++. Well, I am hoping to show you exactly that today. I am not going to go over the basic details of COM as this would take too long, so I am assuming you have an understanding of VB, VC++ and a little COM knowledge. It's not too hard to learn; just takes a little time. So let's get started.\nThe first thing you need to do is fire up Visual Basic 6 (VB 5 should work as well). With VB running, create a new \"ActiveX DLL\" project. Rename the project to \"vbTestCOM\" and the class to \"clsTestClass\". You can do this by clicking in the VB Project Explorer Window on the Project1 item (Step 1), then clicking in the Properties window and selecting the name property (Step 2). Do the same for the Class. Click on the class (Step 3), then the name property and enter the name mentioned above (Step 4). Your project so far should look like the folowing right hand side picture:\nOk, now we are ready to add some code to the VB Class. Click on the \"Tools\" menu, then select the \"Add Procedure\" menu item. The Add Procedure window will open up. In this window we need to add some information. First (Step 1) make sure the type is set to Function. Second (Step 2) enter a Function name called \"CountStringLength\". Finally hit the Ok button and VB will generate the new function in the class.\nYou should have an empty function with which to work. The first thing we will do is specify a return type and an input parameter. Edit your code to look like this:\nPublic Function CountStringLength(ByVal strValue As String) As Long\nWhat are we doing here? We are taking one parameter, as a String type in this case, then returning the length through the return type, which is a Long. We specify the input parameter as ByVal, meaning VB will make a copy of this variable and use the copy in the function, rather than the default ByRef, which passes the variable by reference. This way we can be sure that we do not modify the string by accident that was passed to us by the calling program. Let's add the code now.\nPublic Function CountStringLength(ByVal strValue As String) As Long\nIf strValue = vbNullString Then\nCountStringLength = 0\nCountStringLength = Len(strValue)\nIn the first line of code we are checking to see if the calling program passed us an empty, or NULL, string. If so we return 0 as the length. If the user did pass something other than an empty string, then we count it's length and return the length back to the calling program.\nNow would be a good time to save your project. Accept the default names and put it in a safe directory. We need to compile this project now. Go to the File menu and select the \"Make vbCOMTest.dll...\" menu item.\nThe compiler will produce a file called surprisingly enough: vbCOMTest.dll. The compiler will also do us the favor of entering this new DLL into the system registry. We have finished the VB side of this project, so let's start the VC++ side of it. Fire up a copy of VC++, then select from the menu, \"New Project\". The New Project window should appear. Select a \"Win32 Console Application\" (Step 1), then give it a name of \"TestVBCOM\" (Step 2). Finally, enter a directory you want to build this project in (Step 3 - your directory will vary from what I have entered).\nClick on the \"OK\" button and the \"Win32 Console Application - Step 1 of 1\" window will appear. Leave everything on this page as the default, and click the \"Finish\" button. One final window will appear after this titled \"New Project Information\". Simply click the \"Ok\" button here. You should now have an empty Win32 Console project. Press the \"Ctrl\" and hit the \"N\" key. Another window titled \"New\" will appear. Select the \"C++ Source File\" (Step 1), then enter the new name for this file called, \"TestVBCOM.cpp\" (Step 2 - make sure the Add to Project checkbox is checked and the correct project name is in the drop down combo box), then click the \"Ok\" button to finish.\nNow we are going to get fancy!\nYou need to go to your Start Menu in Windows and navigate to the \"Visual Studio 6\" menu and go into the \"Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 Tools\" sub-menu. In here you will see an icon with the name \"OLE View\". Click on it.\nThe OLE View tool will open up. You will see a window similar to this one:\nCollapse all the trees, if they are not already. This will make it easier to navigate to where we want to go. Highlight the \"Type Libraries\" (Step 1) and expand it. You should see a fairly massive listing. We need to locate our VB DLL. Now, remember what we named the project? Right, we need to look for vbTestCOM. Scroll down until you find this. Once you have found it, double click on it. A new window should appear - the \"ITypeLib Viewer\" window. We are only interested in the IDL (Interface Definition Language) code on the right side of the window. Select the entire IDL text and hit the \"Ctrl\" and \"C\" buttons to copy it to the clipboard.\nYou can close this window and the OLE View window now as we are done with the tool. We need to add the contents of the IDL file into our VC++ project folder. Go to the folder you told VC++ to create your project in and create a new text file there (If you are in Windows Explorer, you can right click in the directory and select \"New\" then scroll over following the arrow and select \"Text Document\"). Rename the text document to \"vbCOMTEST.idl\". Then double click on the new IDL file (VC++ should open it if you named it correctly with an IDL extension). Now paste the code in the file by pressing the \"Ctrl\" and \"V\" keys. The IDL text should be pasted into the file. So far, so good. Now, this IDL file is not going to do us much good until we compile it. That way, VC++ can use the files it generates to talk to the VB DLL. Let's do that now. Open a DOS window and navigate to the directory you created your VC++ project in. Once in that directory, at the prompt you need to type the following to invoke the MIDL compiler:\nE:\\VCSource\\TestVBCOM\\TestVBCOM\\midl vbTestCOM.idl \/h vbTestCOM.h\nHit the \"Enter\" key and let MIDL do its magic. You should see results similar to the following:\nClose the DOS window and head back into VC++. We need to add the newly generated vbTestCOM.h and vbTestCOM_i.c files to the project. You can do this by going to the \"Project\" menu, then selecting the \"Add to Project\" item, and scrolling over to the \"Files\" menu item and clicking on it. A window titled, \"Insert Files into Project\" will open. Select the two files highlighted in the next picture, then select the \"Ok\" button.\nThese two files were generated by MIDL for us, and VC++ needs them in order to talk to the VB DLL (actually VC++ does not need the \"vbCOMTest_i.c\" file in the project, but it is handy have in the project to review). We are going to add the following code to the \"TestVBCOM.cpp\" file now, so navigate to that file in VC++ using the \"Workspace\" window. Open the file by double clicking it and VC++ will display the empty file for editing.\nNow add the following code to the \"TestVBCOM.cpp\" file:\n_clsVBTestClass *IVBTestClass = NULL;\nhr = CoInitialize(0);\nhr = CoCreateInstance( CLSID_clsVBTestClass,\n_bstr_t bstrValue(\"Hello World\");\nhr = IVBTestClass->CountStringLength(bstrValue,\ncout << \"The string is: \" << ReturnValue << \" characters in\nlength.\" << endl;\nhr = IVBTestClass->Release();\ncout << \"CoCreateInstance Failed.\" << endl;\nIf all the code is entered in correctly, then press the \"F7\" key to compile this project. Once the project has compiled cleanly, then press the \"Ctrl\" and the \"F5\" keys to run it. In the C++ code, we include the MIDL created \"vbTestCOM.h\" file, the \"Comdef.h\" file for the _bstr_t class support and the \"iostream.h\" file for the \"cout\" support. The rest of the comments should speak for themselves as to what's occurring. This simple tutorial shows how well a person can integrate VB and VC++ apps together using COM. Not too tough actually.","id":"<urn:uuid:a5fbb498-1ce4-4861-9a4d-ac9d31394472>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.codeproject.com\/Articles\/21\/Beginner-s-Tutorial-Calling-Visual-Basic-ActiveX-D?fid=104&df=90&mpp=10&sort=Position&spc=None&select=1378774&tid=816225&PageFlow=FixedWidth","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.8787377477,"token_count":2064,"score":2.796875,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Common streaming audio formats and players\nUncompressed CD-quality WAV and AIFF files are too large to stream over the Internet for playback in real time. Instead, lighter-weight compressed formats such as MP3 and RealAudio are employed for streaming network audio. These formats use what are called \"lossy\" compression schemes, reducing file sizes by eliminating certain inaudible data from the original files without too significantly degrading playback sound quality. MP3 and RealAudio are excellent streaming formats, achieving performance factors great enough to allow real-time encoding\/decoding over current network bandwidth conditions while delivering satisfying audio quality.\nMP3 and RealAudio are not the only players in the network streaming audio arena. We'll also look at Macromedia's Flash and the Ogg Vorbis project from the Xiphophorus group. Since RealAudio's Internet history begins the earliest, we'll start with RealAudio.\nIn 1995, Progressive Networks (now RealNetworks) introduced RealAudio, the Internet's first widely-deployed streaming audio format. The RealAudio player (RealPlayer) was freely distributed to users who at that time were typically connected to the Internet via low-bandwidth modems; thus, the player supported connection rates as low as 14.4 Kbps, which delivered audio quality comparable to the sound of a decent AM radio. Faster connections such as ISDN accordingly improved reception speed and sound quality.\nBy giving away basic versions of RealPlayer and the RealProducer content-production utility, Progressive Networks seeded the market for their commercial product line and sparked an explosion in network multimedia. Today you can find an astonishing number and variety of RealAudio-enabled sites. As a curious example, I searched Google for \"realaudio history\", hoping to find some background material on the format; instead, I found thousands of sites dedicated to various historical topics, all of which included audio presentations requiring RealPlayer.\nRealPlayer: RealAudio in X\nHappily, RealPlayer is available for Linux, and you can retrieve it for free as either an RPM or tarball package from the Real.com downloads page. Installation is fairly straightforward, but there are a few snags to report. Close your web browser before installing the software, then become the root user and run the installation package. The RPM file needs to be renamed:\nmv rp8_linux20_libc6_i386_cs1_rpm rp8.linux20.libc6.i386.cs1.rpm\nbefore installing it (as root) with this command:\nrpm -i rp8.linux20.libc6.i386.cs1.rpm\nThe tarball must have its permissions set (as root again):\nchmod u+x rp8_linux20_libc6_i386_cs1.bin\nNow you can run the installation package:\nThe installation procedure will automatically set up RealPlayer as a helper application in Netscape, but be forewarned: It will also overwrite any custom settings you have for audio formats such as WAV, AIFF, and AU, so you may want to back up your Netscape preferences before installing RealPlayer. Also, the installation will not automatically update the RealAudio plug-in. Close Netscape, copy the\nrpnp.so file from your new\n$HOME\/RealPlayer directory to\n$HOME\/.netscape\/plugins, fire up Netscape again, and your RealAudio plug-in should now be enabled.

They all depend upon an existing installation of RealPlayer and act as wrappers for RealPlayer, making its functions available to console applications. The RAP and RaWrapper players require support for the frame-buffer device; I wanted to avoid the need for any special graphics support (such as SVGA, frame-buffer, or\nncurses) in my console RealAudio player, so I chose Matthew Campbell's TRPlayer.\nTRPlayer is available as a binary in RPM and DEB packages, but I chose to build the latest beta version (2.0.b2) from the source tarball. TRPlayer's only unique requirement is the slang library and header. Fortunately, slang is found on most mainstream Linux distributions, and a straightforward\n.\/configure; make should have your player ready to rock. However, due to the filesystem vagaries of Linux distributions your build may fail with this message:\nmain.cc:17: slang.h: No such file or directory make: *** [main.o] Error 1\nIf so, change this line in\nto this line:\nWhen the build is complete, become root (\nsu root), run\nmake install, and you will have a new command-line RealAudio player.

Cool...\nRealNetworks deserves praise for maintaining and steadily improving a freely available RealPlayer for Linux, particularly since there's no other way to enjoy all those RealAudio-empowered sites. Harder-core users and developers might be dismayed to learn that Real's software is available only in binary format and that source code is not freely available. Nevertheless, there's only one place to go for RealPlayer, so if you want it, there you go.\nNow let's look at that other major streaming audio format, the notorious MP3.","id":"<urn:uuid:ed3f2ebc-5ea1-4b6f-ae69-05a098955a7a>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.linuxdevcenter.com\/pub\/a\/linux\/2001\/03\/23\/streaming_media.html?page=2","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.8633424044,"token_count":1173,"score":2.59375,"int_score":3}
{"text":"1. Linguistic Background\nThe languages that are currently spoken in the Pacific\nregion can be divided broadly into three groups: the Australian and New Guinean\nlanguages formed by people who participated in the region\u2019s earliest migrations\nover a period of 20,000-30,000 years starting several tens of thousands of years\nago, and the Austronesian languages spoken by Mongoloid people who migrated\nfrom the Asian continent around 3,000 B.C. The region has numerous languages,\nincluding 250 Aboriginal languages in Australia and 750 Papuan languages on\nthe island of New Guinea (including the Indonesian territory of Irian Jaya)\nand neighboring areas. There are also 350 Austronesian languages in Melanesia,\n20 in Polynesia, 12 in Micronesia and 100 in New Guinea (Comrie, Matthews, and\nPolinsky 1996). There is wide variation not only among language groups, but\nalso among the families of languages. Few language families have been identified\namong the languages of Australia and New Guinea using the methods of comparative\nlinguistics. Pacific languages are also characterized by the small size of speaker\npopulations and by the absence of dominant languages. However, there are usually\nbilingual people who can speak or at least understand the languages of neighboring\npopulations, and it is believed that this situation has existed for a long time.\nIn terms of cultural factors, it appears that the diversification of languages\nin the Pacific region was accelerated by the emblematic function of language\nin the creation of a clear distinction between \u201cingroup\u201d and \u201coutgroup.\u201d\nThe languages of New Guinea and the region around it show diverse linkages and wide variations between languages. The Austronesian languages of the Pacific region are mostly classified as Oceanian languages, while the Chamorro and Palau languages of Micronesia are classified into the languages of Western Malaya and Polynesia (WMP, Indonesian family), and the indigenous languages of Maluku and Irian Jaya in Eastern Indonesia into the Central Malayo-Polynesian (CMP) or the South Halmahera-West New Guinea (SHWNG) subgroups. In particular, there are strong similarities between the linguistic characteristics of the CMP and SHWNG languages and those of the Melanesian branch of the Oceanian languages. These linguistic conditions and characteristics are attributable to ethnic migrations within the region over a long period of time, accompanied by contacts and linguistic merging with indigenous Papuan people. Papuan languages are still found in parts of Indonesia, including Northern Halmahera and the islands of Pantar and Alor and central and eastern Timor in the Province of Nusa Tenggara. In New Guinea, contact with Papuan languages has caused some Austronesian languages to exhibit a word order change from subject-verb-object to subject-object-verb (Austronesian Type 2) (Sakiyama 1994).\n2. Linguistic Strata\nWith the start of colonization by the European powers\nin the nineteenth century, a new set of linguistic circumstances developed in\nthe region. First, pidgin languages based on European and Melanesian languages\ngradually emerged as common languages. The establishment of plantations in Samoa\nand in Queensland, Australia, which had concentrations of people who spoke Melanesian\nlanguages, was important in providing breeding grounds for pidgin languages.\nA pidgin language is formed from elements of the grammar of both contributing\nlanguages, though the pidgin languages tend to be looked down upon from the\nperspective of the more dominant of the two parent languages. The region\u2019s\nnewly formed common languages, including Tok Pisin, Bislama, and Solomon Pidgin,\nflourished after they were taken back to the homelands of the various speakers.\nThis was possible because Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea\nwere all multilingual societies without dominant languages. The number of speakers\nof pidgin languages increased rapidly in this environment. At the same time,\nthe continuing existence of ethnic minority languages came under threat.\nExamples of pidgins that were creolized (adopted as mother languages in their own right) include Solomon Pijin, which eventually had over 1,000 speakers aged five and over (1976) in the Solomon Islands. Bislama, a mixture of over 100 indigenous languages grafted upon a base of English and French, is now spoken by almost the entire population of Vanuatu (170,000 in 1996) and is partially creolized. Of particular interest is the fact that a group of more than 1,000 people who emigrated to New Caledonia have adopted Bislama as their primary language. The situation in Papua New Guinea, which has a population of 4,300,000 (1996), is even more dramatic. By 1982 the number of people using Tok Pisin as their primary language had reached 50,000, while another 2,000,000 used it as a second language (Grimes 1996).\n3. Minority Languages and Common Languages in the Pacific Region\nThe Atlas of the World\u2019s Languages in Danger of Disappearing published by UNESCO (Wurm 1996) provides merely a brief overview of the current situation in Papua New Guinea, Australia, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. There is no mention of Micronesia, New Caledonia, or Polynesia, presumably because of a lack of information resulting from the large number of languages in these areas. The following report covers areas and languages that I have researched and endangered languages covered by field studies carried out by Japanese researchers.\n3.1 Belau (Palau), Micronesia\nAccording to Belau (Palau) government statistics (1990),\nthe total population of 15,122 people includes 61 people living on outlying\nislands in Sonsorol State, and 33 in Hatohobei (Tochobei) State. Apart from\nthe Sonsorol Islands, Sonsorol State also includes the islands of Fanah, Meril\nand Pulo An. In addition to the Hatohobei language, the language mix on these\noutlying islands also includes nuclear Micronesian (Chuukic) languages, which\nare the core Oceanian languages spoken in the Carolines. They differ from Palauan,\nwhich is an Indonesian language. To lump these languages together as the Sonsorol\nlanguages with a total of 600 speakers (Wurm and Hattori 1981-83) is as inaccurate\nas combining the Miyako dialects of Okinawa into a single classification.\nThe number of Chuukic speakers has declined steadily since these figures were compiled. Starting in the German colonial period of the early twentieth century, people have been relocated from these outlying islands to Echang on Arakabesan Island in Belau. Today there are several hundred of these people. Many of those born in the new location only speak Palauan. A study by S. Oda (1975) estimated that there were 50 speakers of Pulo Annian. The language of Meril continued to decline and has now become extinct.\nFrom the early part of the twentieth century until the end of World War II, Micronesia was under Japanese rule, administered by the South Seas Mandate. Japanese was used as a common language, and its influence is still evident today. The linguistic data on Micronesia presented by Grimes (1996) is distorted by the fact that, while the number of English speakers is shown, no mention is made of Japanese. A study carried out in 1970 (Wurm, M\u00fchlh\u00e4usler, and Tryon 1996) found that people aged 35 and over could speak basic Japanese. This group is equivalent to people aged 63 and over in 1998. An estimate based on Belau government statistics (1990) suggests that more than 1,000 of these people are still alive. In the State of Yap in the Federated States of Micronesia, where the percentage of females attending school is said to have been low, we can assume that the number of Japanese speakers has fallen below 500.\nIt has been suggested that if Japan had continued to rule Micronesia, Japanese would certainly have become the sole language in the region, and indigenous languages would have disappeared (Wurm, M\u00fchlh\u00e4usler, and Tryon 1996). This seems an overly harsh appraisal of Japan\u2019s language policy. Except in the schools, as a matter of fact no significant steps were taken to promote the use of Japanese. Micronesia previously had no common language for communication between different islands. Even today, old people from different islands use Japanese as a common language (Sakiyama 1995; Toki 1998). However, the role of this Japanese pidgin appears to have ended within a single generation, and in this sense it too is an endangered language. Pidgin Japanese continues to be used as a lingua franca by Taiwanese in their fifties and older (Wurm, M\u00fchlh\u00e4usler, and Tryon 1996), and the number of speakers is estimated to have been 10,000 in 1993 (Grimes 1996).\n3.2 Yap, Micronesia\nNgulu Atoll is situated between the Yap Islands and the Belau Islands. The Nguluwan language is a mixture of Yapese and Ulithian, which belongs to the Chuukic family. It has inherited the Ulithian phonetic system and a partial version of Yap grammar (Sakiyama 1982). Nguluwan appears to have evolved through bilingualism between Yapese and Ulithian, and to describe it as a dialect of Ulithian (Grimes 1996) is inappropriate. In 1980 there were 28 speakers. Even with the inclusion of people who had migrated to Guror on Yap Island, where the parent village is located, the number of speakers was fewer than 50. Speakers are being assimilated rapidly into the Yapese language and culture.\n3.3 Maluku, Indonesia\nThe book Atlas Bahasa Tanah Maluku (Taber et al. 1996) covers 117 ethnic languages (Austronesian, Papuan), including numbers of speakers for each language, areas of habitation and migration, access routes, simple cultural information, and basic numbers and expressions. This work is especially valuable since it corrects inaccuracies and errors in the 1977 Classification and Index of the World's Languages by C. Y. L. Voegelin and F. M. Voegelin. It also distinguishes languages and dialects according to their a priori mutual intelligibility. Fifteen languages are listed as having fewer than 1,000 speakers. They include the Nakaela language of Seram, which has only 5 speakers, the Amahai and Paulohi languages, also of Seram, which are spoken by 50 people each, and the South Nuaulu and Yalahatan languages, which have 1,000 speakers each on Seram Island. The data, however, are not complete. For example, the Bajau language is not included, presumably because of the difficulty of accessing the various solitary islands where the Bajau people live. The author researched the Yalahatan language in 1997 and in 1998, and the Bajau language (2,000 speakers) on Sangkuwang Island in 1997.\n3.4 Irian Jaya, Papua New Guinea\nDetailed information about the names, numbers of speakers,\nand research data for over 800 languages spoken in New Guinea and its coastal\nregions can be found in the works by the Barrs (1978), Voorhoeve (1975), and\nWurm (1982). However, not only the minority languages but even the majority\nlanguages other than a few have yet to be surveyed and researched adequately.\nThere are many languages for which vocabulary collection has yet to be undertaken.\nIt appears that dictionaries or grammars have been published for less than one-tenth\nof the region\u2019s languages. However, the gospel has been published in several\ndozen languages using orthographies established by SIL. Papuan languages range\nfrom those with substantial speaker populations, including Enga, Chimbu (Kuman),\nand Dani, which are spoken by well over 100,000 people, to endangered languages\nsuch as Abaga with 5 speakers (150 according to Wurm ), Makolkol with\n7 (unknown according to Wurm), and Sene with under 10. There are very many languages\nfor which the number of speakers is unknown and more up-to-date information\nis needed. Also, despite having substantially more than 1,000 speakers (Wurm\n1982; Grimes 1996), Murik is in danger of extinction due to the creolization\nof Tok Pisin (Foley 1986). Moreover, it is questionable whether the present\nlists include all of the region\u2019s languages.\nInformation about Irian Jaya is even sparser. A study on popular languages carried out by the author in 1984-85 revealed that Kuot (New Ireland), Taulil (New Britain), and Sko (Irian Jaya) all had several hundred speakers and that, in the case of Taulil in particular, an increasing number of young people were able to understand what their elders were saying but could no longer speak the language themselves. There has been a rapid shift to Kuanua, an indigenous language used in trade with neighboring Rabaul, which is replacing Taulil.\n3.5 Solomon Islands, Melanesia\nThe total population of the Solomon Islands is 390,000 (1996). There are 63 Papuan, Melanesian, and Polynesian indigenous languages, of which only 37 are spoken by over 1,000 people (Grimes 1996). The Papuan Kazukuru languages (Guliguli, Doriri) of New Georgia, which were known to be endangered as early as 1931, have become extinct already, leaving behind just some scant linguistic information. The Melanesian Tanema and Vano languages of the Santa Cruz Islands and the Laghu language of the Santa Isabel Islands were extinct by 1990. This does not mean that the groups speaking them died out, but rather that the languages succumbed to the shift to Roviana, a trade language used in neighboring regions, or were replaced by Solomon Pijin (Sakiyama 1996).\n3.6 Vanuatu, Melanesia\nThe situation in Vanuatu is very similar to that in the\nSolomon Islands. The official view, written in Bislama, is as follows:\nI gat sam ples long 110 lanwis evriwan so i gat bigfala lanwis difrens long Vanuatu. Pipol blong wan velej ol i toktok long olgeta bakegen evridei nomo long lanwis be i no Bislama, Inglis o Franis. (Vanuatu currently has 110 indigenous languages, which are all very different linguistically. On an everyday basis people in villages speak only their local languages, not Bislama, English, or French). (Vanuatu, 1980, Institute of Pacific Studies)\nAmong the Melanesian and Polynesian indigenous languages spoken by 170,000 people, or 93% of the total population (1996), there are many small minority tongues. These include Aore, which has only a single speaker (extinct according to Wurm and Hattori [1981-83]); Maragus and Ura (with 10 speakers each); Nasarian, and Sowa (with 20); and Dixon Reef, Lorediakarkar, Mafea, and Tambotalo (with 50). If languages with around 100 speakers are included, this category accounts for about one-half of the total number of languages (Grimes 1996). The spread of Bislama has had the effect of putting these languages in jeopardy.\n3.7 New Caledonia, Melanesia\nNew Caledonia has a total population of 145,000 people,\nof whom 62,000 are indigenous. As of 1981, there were 28 languages, all Melanesian\nexcept for the one Polynesian language Uvean. The only languages with over 2,000\nspeakers are Cemuhi, Paic\u00ee, Aji\u00eb, and X\u00e2r\u00e2c\u00f9\u00f9, along with Dehu and Nengone,\nwhich are spoken on the Loyalty Islands.\nDumbea (Paita), which is spoken by several hundred people, has been described by T. Shintani and Y. Paita (1983). And M. Osumi (1995) has described Tinrin, which has an estimated 400 speakers. Speakers of Tinrin are bilingual in X\u00e2r\u00e2c\u00f9\u00f9 or Aji\u00eb. Ner\u00eb has 20 speakers and Arh\u00f6 10, while Waamwang, which had 3 speakers in 1946, is now reported to be extinct (Grimes 1996). Descendants of Javanese, who began to migrate to New Caledonia in the early part of the twentieth century, now number several thousand. The Javanese language spoken by these people, which has developed in isolation from the Javanese homeland, has attracted attention as a new pidgin language.\nWhen Europeans first arrived in Australia in 1788, it is estimated that there were 700 different tribes in a population of 500,000-1,000,000 (Comrie, Matthews, and Polinsky 1996). By the 1830s Tasmanian had become extinct, and today the number of Aboriginal languages has fallen to less than one-half what it once was. However, T. Tsunoda left detailed records of the Warrungu language, the last speaker of which died in 1981, and the Djaru language, which has only 200 speakers (Tsunoda 1974, 1981). Yawuru, which belongs to the Nyulnyulan family, reportedly has fewer than 20 speakers, all aged in their sixties or older. The language is described by K. Hosokawa (1992).\nThe Pacific has been heavily crisscrossed by human migration\nfrom ancient to modern times. All Pacific countries except the Kingdom of Tonga\nwere colonized. This historical background is reflected in the existence of\nmultilevel diglossia in all regions of the Pacific.\nDepending on the generation, the top level of language in Micronesia is either English (the official language) or pidgin Japanese (used as a lingua franca among islands). The next level is made up of the languages of major islands that exist as political units, such as Palauan, Yapese and Ponapean. On the lowest level are the various ethnic languages spoken mainly on solitary islands.\nIn the Maluku Islands of Indonesia, local Malay languages such as Ambonese Malay, North Maluku Malay and Bacanese Malay, form a layer beneath the official language, Indonesian. Under them are the dominant local languages, such as Hitu, which is spoken by 15,000 people on Ambon Island, and Ternate and Tidore, which are spoken in the Halmahera region. These are important as urban languages. On the lowest level are the various vernaculars.\nIn Papua New Guinea, standard English forms the top level, followed by Papua New Guinean English. Tok Pisin and Hiri Motu are used as common languages among the various ethnic groups. Beneath these layers are the regional or occupational common languages. For example, Hiri Motu is used as the law enforcement lingua franca in coastal areas around the Gulf of Papua, Yabem as a missionary language along the coast of the Huon Gulf, and Malay as a trade language in areas along the border with Indonesia. On the next level are the ethnic and tribal languages used on a day-to-day basis.\nAn example of a similar pattern in Polynesia can be found in Hawaii, where English and Hawaiian English rank above Da Kine Talk or Pidgin To Da Max, which are mixtures of English and Oceanic languages and are used as common languages among the various Asian migrants who have settled in Hawaii. Beneath these are ethnic languages, including Hawaiian and the various immigrant languages, such as a common Japanese based on the Hiroshima dialect, as well as Cantonese, Korean, and Tagalog.\nAll of the threatened languages are in danger because of their status as indigenous minority languages positioned at the lowest level of the linguistic hierarchy. Reports to date have included little discussion of the multilevel classification of linguistic strata from a formal linguistic perspective. It will be necessary in the future to examine these phenomena from the perspectives of sociolinguistics or linguistic anthropology.\nBarr, Donald F., and Sharon G. Barr. 1978.

{"text":"Question from Amanda: Where and what acids are found in wine. Which wines have more acid (dry or sweet) and why due to the climate. Explain why and how titration can be used to determine the relative acid content of wine. If you could help answer my question i would be very grateful.\nAnswer: Hi, Amanda! Thanks for your question! I\u2019ll do my best\u2026.\nThe main grape acid is tartaric, a relatively strong acid, unlike most fruits. It\u2019s followed by malic (found in lots of fruits and vegetables) and there are trace amounts of lots of different acids. We have an article on wine components, including acid, at goosecross.com.\nGenerally, white wines are higher in acid than reds, for aesthetic reasons. Sweet wines should be the highest of all, to offset the sweetness, or the wine will be cloying.\nCool climates usually produce wines of high acid compared to warm climates because heat causes the sugar to go up and the acid to go down. A Chardonnay from Burgundy, France is almost always higher in acid than a Napa Valley Chardonnay because of the difference in climate. Imagine trying to ripen tomatoes in a cold climate\u2013they will be quite tart!\nTitration is a simple color-change test. I\u2019ve paraphrased this from a wine text: Titration is the process of determining the concentration of a substance, such as acid, in a solution by adding a carefully measured standard reagent (usually sodium hydroxide) until a reaction (change in color) occurs due to the presence of an indicator (phenolphthalein). Most home winemakers buy inexpensive kits to do this.\nI hope this helps you.

{"text":"Types of literature\nPRIMARY SOURCES are publications that report the results of original research. They may be in the form of conference papers, monographic series, technical reports, theses and dissertations, or journal articles. Because they present information in its original form (that is, it has not been interpreted or condensed or otherwise \u201crepackaged\u201d by other writers), these are considered primary sources. The works present new thinking\/discoveries\/results and unite them with the existing knowledge base. Journal articles that report original research are one of the more common and important steps in the information sharing cycle. They often go through a process in which they are \u201cpeer reviewed\u201d by other experts who evaluate the work and findings before publication.\nSECONDARY SOURCES are those which are published about the primary literature, that generalize, analyze, interpret, evaluate or otherwise \u201cadd value\u201d to the original information, OR which simplify the process of finding and evaluating the primary literature. Some examples of secondary sources are \u201creview\u201d articles and indexes or bibliographies, such as PubMed or the ScienceDirect.\nTERTIARY SOURCES compile or digest information from primary or secondary sources that has become widely accepted. They aim to provide a broad overview of a topic, or data, already proven facts, and definitions, often presented in a convenient form. They provide no new information. These include \u201creference\u201d types of works such as textbooks, encyclopedias, fact books, guides and handbooks, and computer databases such as The Handbook of the Microbiological Media and SciFinder.\nGRAY LITERATURE are source materials not available through the usual systems of publication (e.g., books or periodicals) and distribution. Gray literature includes conference proceedings, dissertations, technical reports, and working papers. Locating this type of literature is a little more difficult, but there are finding tools such as Dissertations Abstracts and PapersFirst.\nWhat is a literature review?\nA literature review discusses published information in a particular subject area, and sometimes information in a particular subject area within a certain time period.\nA literature review can be just a simple summary of the sources, but it usually has an organizational pattern and combines both summary and synthesis. A summary is a recap of the important information of the source, but a synthesis is a re-organization, or a reshuffling, of that information. It might give a new interpretation of old material or combine new with old interpretations. Or it might trace the intellectual progression of the field, including major debates. And depending on the situation, the literature review may evaluate the sources and advise the reader on the most pertinent or relevant.\nBut how is a literature review different from an academic research paper?\nWhile the main focus of an academic research paper is to support your own argument, the focus of a literature review is to summarize and synthesize the arguments and ideas of others. The academic research paper also covers a range of sources, but it is usually a select number of sources, because the emphasis is on the argument. Likewise, a literature review can also have an \"argument,\" but it is not as important as covering a number of sources. In short, an academic research paper and a literature review contain some of the same elements. In fact, many academic research papers will contain a literature review section. But it is the aspect of the study (the argument or the sources) that is emphasized that determines what type of document it is.\nWhy do we write literature reviews?\nLiterature reviews provide you with a handy guide to a particular topic. If you have limited time to conduct research, literature reviews can give you an overview or act as a stepping stone. For professionals, they are useful reports that keep them up to date with what is current in the field. For scholars, the depth and breadth of the literature review emphasizes the credibility of the writer in his or her field. Literature reviews also provide a solid background for a research paper's investigation. Comprehensive knowledge of the literature of the field is essential to most research papers.\nWho writes these things, anyway?\nLiterature reviews are written occasionally in the humanities, but mostly in the sciences and social sciences; in experiment and lab reports, they constitute a section of the paper. Sometimes a literature review is written as a paper in itself.\nExcerpt from \u201cLiterature Reviews\u201d from The Writing Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (http:\/\/writingcenter.unc.edu\/resources\/handouts-demos\/specific-writing-assignments\/literature-reviews), 2007.\nCollection Development Librarian\n1014 Boswell Ave.\nCrete NE 68333","id":"<urn:uuid:36c1f567-48f3-46f4-b9c2-332bfdf4d2b6>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/libguides.doane.edu\/biosem","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9317653775,"token_count":972,"score":3.375,"int_score":3}

{"text":"The diagnosis of Trichotillomania (TM) is synonymous with the act of recurrently pulling one\u2019s own body hair resulting in noticeable thinning or baldness. (American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, 2000, p. 674) Sites of hair pulling can include any area of the body in which hair is found, but the most common sites are the scalp, eyelashes, eyebrows, and the pubis area. (Kraemer, 1999, p. 298) The disorder itself is categorized in the DSM-IV-TR as an \u201cImpulse Control Disorder Not Elsewhere Classified\u201d along with disorders like Pathological Gambling, Pyromania, Kleptomania, and Intermittent Explosive Disorder. Although TM was previously considered to be a rare disorder, more recent research indicates that prevalence rates of TM may be as high as 2% of the general population. (Kraemer, 1999, p. 298) This prevalence rate is significantly higher than the lifetime prevalence rate of .6% that is cited as a potential baseline among college students the DSM-IV-TR. (4th ed., text rev.; DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000, p. 676) The condition appears to be more common among women and the period of onset is typically in childhood or adolescence. (Kraemer, 1999, p. 298) As is customary with most DSM-IV-TR diagnoses, the act of hair pulling cannot be better accounted for by another mental disorder (like delusions, for example) or a general medical condition. Like every disorder in the DSM-IV-TR, the disturbance must cause significant distress or impairment in functioning. (4th ed., text rev.; DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000, p. 675)\nAlopecia is a key concept that must be understood in order to complete the differential diagnosis of TM. Alopecia is a condition of baldness in the most general sense. (Shiel, Jr. & Stoppler, 2008, p. 14) Other medically related causes of alopecia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of TM, especially when working with an individual who deny pulling their hair. The common suspects include male-pattern baldness, Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE), Lichen Planopilaris (also known as Acuminatus), Folliculitis Decalvans, Pseudopelade of Brocq, and Alopecia Mucinosa (Follicular Mucinosis). (4th ed., text rev.; DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000, p. 676) Comprehensive coverage of these medical conditions is beyond the scope of this article \u2013 all of the aforementioned confounding variables can be eliminated by a general practitioner.\nThere are a number of idiosyncratic features associated with TM that bear mentioning. Although the constellation of features covered here is not sufficient to warrant a diagnosis in isolation, they can aid in the differential diagnosis process. Alopecia, regardless of the cause, has been known to lead sufferers to tremendous feats of avoidance so that the hair loss remains undetected. Simply avoiding social functions or other events where the individual (and their attendant hair loss) might be uncovered is a common occurrence. In cases where individual\u2019s focus of attention is on the head or scalp, it is not uncommon for affected individuals to attempt to hide hair loss by adopting complimentary hair styles or wearing other headwear (e.g., hats, wigs, etc). These avoidance behaviors will be the target of exposure and response prevention later in this article.\nIn addition to avoidant behavior and elaborate attempts to \u201ccover it up,\u201d individuals with TM frequently present with clinically significant difficulty in areas such as self-esteem and mood. Comorbidity, or the presence of one or more disorders in the addition to a primary diagnosis, is the rule not the exception in the stereotypical presentation of TM. Mood disorders (like depression) are the most common (65%) \u2013 anxiety (57%), chemical use (22%), and eating disorders (20%) round out the top four mostly likely candidates for comorbidity. (Kraemer, 1999, p. 298) These comorbidity rates are not overly surprising since they parallel prevalence rates across the wider population \u2013 perhaps with the notable exception of the high rate of comorbid eating disorders. We can speculate about the source of comorbidity \u2013 one possible hypothesis is that a few people who suffer TM also suffer from a persistent cognitive dissonance associated with having happy-go-lucky personality trait which leads them \u201clet the chips fall where they may.\u201d They are individuals prone to impulsivity, but they are subdued and controlled the shame, guilt, frustration, fear, rage, and helplessness associated with the social limitations placed on them by the disorder. (Ingram, 2012, p. 269) On the topic of personality, surprisingly enough, research suggests that personality disorders do not share significant overlap with TM. This includes Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) despite the fact that BPD is often associated with self-harming behavior. (Kraemer, 1999, p. 299)\nDifferentiating TM from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) can be challenging in some cases. TM is similar to OCD because there is a \u201csense of gratification\u201d or \u201crelief\u201d when pulling the hair out. Unlike individuals with OCD, individuals with TM do not perform their compulsions in direct response to an obsession and\/or according to rules that must be rigidly adhered to. (4th ed., text rev.; DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000, p. 676) There are, however, observed similarities between OCD and TM regarding phenomenology, neurological test performance, response to SSRI\u2019s, and contributing elements of familial and\/or genetic factors. (Kraemer, 1999, p. 299) Due to the large genetic component contributions of both disorders, obtaining a family history (vis-\u00e0-vis a detailed genogram) is highly recommended. The comprehensive genogram covering all mental illness can be helpful in the discovery the comorbid conditions identified above as well.\nThere is some suggestion that knowledge of events associated with onset is \u201cintriguing, but unnecessary for successful treatment.\u201d (Kraemer, 1999, p. 299) I call shenanigans. There is a significant connection between the onset of TM and the patient enduring loss, perceived loss, and\/or trauma. Time is well spent exploring the specific environmental stressors that precipitated the disorder. Although ignoring circumstances surrounding onset might be prudent when employing strict behavioral treatment paradigms, it seems like a terrible waste of time to endure suffering without identifying some underlying meaning or purpose that would otherwise be missed if we overlook onset specifics. \u201cEverything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms \u2013 to choose one\u2019s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one\u2019s own way.\u201d (Frankl, 1997, p. 86) If we acknowledge that all behavior is purposeful, then we must know and understand the circumstances around onset if we will ever understand the purpose of said behavior. I liken this to a difference in professional opinion and personal preference because either position can be reasonably justified, but in the end the patient should make the ultimate decision about whether or not to explore onset contributions vis-\u00e0-vis \u201cimagery dialogue\u201d or a similar technique. (Young, Klosko, & Weishaar, 2003, p. 123) If such imagery techniques are unsuccessful or undesired by the client, a psychodynamic conversation between \u201cinternal parts of oneself\u201d can add clarity to the persistent inability of the client to delay gratification. (Ingram, 2012, p. 292) Such explorations are likely to be time consuming, comparatively speaking, and should not be explored with patients who are bound by strict EAP requirements or managed care restrictions on the type and length of treatment. Comorbid developmental disabilities and cognitive deficits may preclude this existential exploration. I employ the exploration of existential issues of origin in the interest of increasing treatment motivation, promoting adherence, enhancing the therapeutic milieu, and thwarting subsequent lapses by anchoring cognitive dissonance to a concrete event.\nTM represents a behavioral manifestation of a fixed action patterns (FAPs) that is rigid, consistent, and predicable. FAPs are generally thought to have evolved from our most primal instincts as animals \u2013 they are believed to contain fundamental behavioral \u2018switches\u2019 that enhance the survivability of the human species. (Lambert & Kinsley, 2011, p. 232) The nature of FAPs that leads some researchers to draw parallels to TM is that FAPs appear to be qualitatively \u201cballistic.\u201d It\u2019s an \u201call or nothing\u201d reaction that is comparable to an action potential traveling down the axon of a neuron. Once they are triggered they are very difficult to suppress and may have a tendency to \u201ckindle\u201d other effects. (Lambert & Kinsley, 2011, p. 233)\nThere are some unique considerations when it comes to assessing a new patient with TM. Because chewing on or ingesting the hair is reported in nearly half of TM cases, the attending clinician should always inquire about oral manipulation and associated gastrointestinal pain associated with a connected hair mass in the stomach or bowel (trichobezoar). Motivation for change should be assessed and measured because behavioral interventions inherently require a great deal of effort. Family and social systems should not be ignored since family dynamics can exacerbate symptomatlogy vis-\u00e0-vis pressure to change (negative reinforcement), excessive attention (positive reinforcement), or both. (Kraemer, 1999, p. 299)\nWhat remains to be seen is the role of stress in the process of \u201ctriggering\u201d a TM episode. Some individuals experience an \u201citch like\u201d sensation as a physical antecedent that remits once the hair is pulled. This \u201citch like\u201d sensation is far from universal. Some clinicians and researchers believe that the abnormal grooming behavior found in TM is \u201celicited in response to stress\u201d with the necessary but not sufficient condition of \u201climited options for motoric behavior and tension release.\u201d (Kraemer, 1999, p. 299) Although this stress hypothesis may materialize as a tenable hypothesis in some cases, it\u2019s by no means typical. Most people diagnosed with TM report that the act of pulling typically occurs during affective states of relaxation and distraction. Most individuals whom suffer from TM do not report clinically significant levels of anxiety as the \u201ctrigger\u201d of bouts of hair pulling. We could attribute this to an absence of insight regarding anxiety related triggers or, perhaps anxiety simply does not play a significant role in the onset and maintenance of hair pulling episodes. Regardless of the factors that trigger episodes, a comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment that includes environmental stressors (past, present and anticipated) should be explored.\nThe options for treatment of TM are limited at best. SSRIs have demonstrated some potential in the treatment of TM, but more research is needed before we can consider SSRIs as a legitimate first-line treatment. SSRIs are worth a shot as an adjunct treatment in cases of chronic, refractory, or treatment resistant TM. I would consider recommending a referral to a psychiatrist (not a general practitioner) for a medication review due in part to the favorable risk profile of the most recent round of SSRIs. Given the high rate of comorbidity with mood and anxiety disorders \u2013 if either is anxiety or depression are comorbid, SSRIs will likely be recommended regardless. Killing two birds with one stone is the order of the day, but be mindful that some medication can interfere with certain treatment techniques like imaginal or in vivo exposure. (Ledley, Marx, & Heimberg, 2010, p. 141) Additional research is needed before anxiolytic medications can be recommended in the absence of comorbid anxiety disorders (especially with children). Hypnosis and hypnotic suggestion in combination with other behavioral interventions may be helpful for some individuals, but I don\u2019t know enough about it at this time to recommend it. Call me skeptical, or ignorant, but I prefer to save the parlor tricks for the circus\u2026\nHabit reversal is no parlor trick. My goal isn\u2019t to heal the patient; that would create a level of dependence I am not comfortable with\u2026 my goal is to teach clients how to heal themselves. Okay, but how? The combination of Competing Response Training, Awareness\/Mindfulness Training, Relaxation Training, Contingency Management, Cognitive Restructuring, and Generalization Training is the best hope for someone who seeks some relief from TM. Collectively I will refer to this collection of techniques as Habit Reversal.\nCompeting Response Training is employed in direct response to hair pulling or in situations where hair pulling might be likely. In the absence of \u201cinternal restraints to impulsive behavior,\u201d artificial circumstances are created by identifying substitute behaviors that are totally incompatible with pulling hair. (Ingram, 2012, p. 292) Just like a compulsive gambling addict isn\u2019t in any danger if spends all his money on rent, someone with TM is much less likely to pull hair if they are doing something else with their hands.\nAntecedents, or triggers, are sometimes referred to as discriminative stimuli. (Ingram, 2012, p. 230) \u201cWe sense objects in a certain way because of our application of priori intuitions\u2026\u201d (Pirsig, 1999, p. 133) Altering the underlying assumptions entrenched in maladaptive priori intuitions is the core purpose of Awareness and Mindfulness Training. \u201cThere is a lack of constructive self-talk mediating between the trigger event and the behavior. The therapist helps the client build intervening self-messages: Slow down and think it over; think about the consequences.\u201d (Ingram, 2012, p. 221) The connection to contingency management should be self evident. Utilizing a customized self-monitoring record, the patient begins to acquire the necessary insight to \u201cspot\u201d maladaptive self talk. \u201cSpotting\u201d is not a new or novel concept \u2013 it is central component of Abraham Low\u2019s revolutionary self help system Recovery International. (Abraham Low Self-Help Systems, n.d.) The customized self-monitoring record should invariably include various data elements such as precursors, length of episode, number of hairs pulled, and a subjective unit of distress representing the level of \u201curge\u201d or desire to pull hair. (Kraemer, 1999) The act of recording behavior (even in the absence of other techniques) is likely to produce significant reductions in TM symptomatlogy. (Persons, 2008, p. 182-201) Perhaps more importantly, associated activities, thoughts, and emotions that may be contributing to the urge to pull should be codified. (Kraemer, 1999, p. 300) In session, this record can be reviewed and subsequently tied to \u201chigh risk circumstances\u201d and \u201cpriori intuitions\u201d involving constructs such as anger, frustration, depression, and boredom.\nRelaxation training is a critical component if we subscribe to the \u201ckindling\u201d hypothesis explained previously. Relaxation is intended to reduce the urges that inevitably trigger the habit. Examples abound, but diaphragmatic breathing, progressive relaxation, and visualization are all techniques that can be employed in isolation or in conjunction with each other.\nContingency Management is inexorably tied to the existential anchor of cognitive dissonance described above. My emphasis on this element is where my approach might differ from some other clinicians. \u201cYou are free to do whatever you want, but you are responsible for the consequences of everything that you do.\u201d (Ingram, 2012, p. 270) This might include the client writing down sources of embarrassment, advantages of controlling the symptomatlogy of TM, etc. (Kraemer, 1999) The moment someone with pyromania decides that no fire worth being imprisoned, they will stop starting fires. The same holds true with someone who acknowledges the consequences of pulling their hair.\nHow do we define success? Once habit reversal is successfully accomplished in one setting or situation, the client needs to be taught how to generalize that skill to other contexts. A hierarchical ranking of anxiety provoking situations can be helpful in this process since self-paced graduated exposure is likely to increase tolerability for the anxious client. (Ingram, 2012, p. 240) If skills are acquired, and generalization occurs, we can reasonably expect a significant reduction in TM symptomatlogy. The challenges are significant, cognitive behavioral therapy is much easier said than done. High levels of treatment motivation are required for the behavioral elements, and moderate to high levels of insight are exceptionally helpful for the cognitive elements. In addition, this is an impulse control disorder\u2026 impulsivity leads to treatment noncompliance and termination. The combination of all the above, in addition to the fact that TM is generally acknowledged as one of the more persistent and difficult to treat disorders, prevents me from providing any prognosis other than \u201cthis treatment will work as well as the client allows it to work.\u201d\nAbraham Low Self-Help Systems.

{"text":"What motivates young people to learn?\nFun? Imagination? Fear of the future without a college education?\nIf you ask them, they will tell you that you can teach them anything if you make it matter to them.\nThe easiest way is to make it about them. Nearly 20 years ago, when I took over the History Department of a Nairobi School, the most successful thing I did was to introduce a family tree project.\nI had Kikuyu students in my classroom, and Luo and Kalenjin and several born in Britain as well as five or six born in Nairobi but with parents or grandparents born in the Indian Subcontinent. Computers barely existed, so all information was gathered by talking to family members, either in person or on the phone, waiting for visits or even writing letters. Everyone had to keep notes and start drawing their tree \u2013 and as they grew, the trees became collages, with stories and even artefacts stuck on: a coin, a bead, a piece of cloth, a photograph.\nMy students held court, sharing their research and findings, feeling the thrill of an attentive audience. They were the experts on their own lives, and they loved it (a lot more than Napoleon, who they\u2019d done the previous term).\nOf course you can\u2019t design thirteen or fourteen years of curriculum around \u2018Me\u2019 \u2013 at least not without creating a generation of narcissistic monsters. But taking time to relate distant or abstract material to those in the room, and finding ways to engage heart and emotions as well as head, makes excellent educational sense.\nThis is one area where education can learn from the non-profit sector which has long understood that you engage people by creating proximity. It\u2019s hard to care about people of whom we know nothing in a faraway country; the trick is to tell stories to bring them closer, to show the similarities between their lives and ours, to help us understand how it might feel to be them. To make it more real.\nCarl Jung wrote that people cannot stand too much reality, but I disagree: in my experience, teenagers gobble it up. It brings out the best in them, differentiating them as individuals with both abilities and passions.\n2 years ago Mayor of London Boris Johnson and I both hit on the idea of a London Curriculum (although I\u2019m pretty sure I thought of it first.) I based mine on an experimental class I\u2019d taught a few years before in the US that used our local city as a classroom. Part of my inspiration also came from CITYTerm, a brilliant programme run out of the Masters School, which uses New York City as a classroom and laboratory. In both cases the approach was project-based and relied on collaboration with experts from the city \u2013 architects, engineers, poets, social workers and entrepreneurs.\nIt can come as something of a shock to learn what\u2019s on your doorstep: the things that are closest to us exert huge influence, yet we seldom look at them carefully, let alone understand them.\nThe nearly 4 million people who have seen Chimamanda Adichie\u2019s TED Talk on the danger of a single story will also have heard her descriptions of growing up on a Nigerian university campus reading British and American children\u2019s books. She loved those books, but because of them, the first stories she wrote featured characters with white skin and blue eyes, who played in the snow and ate apples. Only later did she realise that people who looked and thought like her could be in books too.\nIn January I met Deborah Ahenkorah, Ghanaian Echoing Green Fellow and founder of the Golden Baobab Prize for African literature for children and young adults. She created the prize because\n\u201cthe tremendous lack of good quality African children\u2019s literature dawned on me. A continent so large and richly diverse has tons of wonderful stories to share with young people everywhere: where were these stories?\u201d\nLast year they had more than 400 entries from 25 African countries. They also run workshops for writers and illustrators, and have plans to establish distribution channels across the continent to ensure that African books reach African children in their schools and, at last, in their own homes.\nAnd it\u2019s not just African children on the continent who need stories about themselves. There are millions of children of African heritage in the diaspora who never read stories that connect them with their own identities either. For stories cross continents too. Last month in Ghana I visited the slave castles of the Gold Coast and saw the door of no return through which millions of men, women and children left, many of whom ended their days in Jamaica. With over 200,000 Ghanaians and 250,000 Jamaicans in London, shouldn\u2019t these stories be told in British schools too?\nWho else is in our classrooms? Are we telling their stories?\nGrowing up is an identity project, and if we want to engage young people, we need to show them that school is the place to learn about the things they care about. We do that best by nurturing schools\u2019 most valuable secret weapons \u2013 infectiously enthusiastic teachers.

{"text":"How To Win At Science Fairs (Dec, 1960)\nHow To Win At Science Fairs\nby Ronald Benrey\nYOU CAN WIN at a Science Fair as long as one thing interests you more than winning does. This is your project itself. It is going to be judged on scientific thought, creative ability, and presentation. You will really have to know the field your project is concerned with. This takes effort. Since you lack the means of a professional laboratory, you will have to do much with little. This takes trial and error and just plain work. Your presentation must be attractive and clear. This means good workmanship, which takes time and care. You are going to have to show some originality. After all, there is no use doing what everybody else is doing: be different. For this, you have to have the other three under control. By the way, the \u201claymen\u201d who see your exhibit will ask all kinds of questions. Have good answers at your fingertips. The judges won\u2019t be laymen, and any double-talk will scream to them that you don\u2019t know your subject. It may also make them suspect that the best parts of your project are not your work. This would be unjust, perhaps, but deadly. Now, whether your entry covers a large table top or can just be tucked under your arm, it is going to be a big job. It can\u2019t be left for a \u201ccrash program\u201d in the last few weeks before the Fair. It is going to eat up big portions of your time, energy, and spending money for the next several months. All this demands your interest. But it isn\u2019t simply a matter of \u201cfun. \u201d Licking this challenge may be a turning point in your life. With or without a scholarship prize, your career may begin with it.\nAs a reader of Electronics Illustrated your project will probably deal with electronics or applied physics rather than with biological or earth sciences. Select your topic carefully from a broad subject that really interests you. A massive effort in the direction of a passing fancy will result in a mediocre project at best. Take a limited subtopic that you think worth investigating and that you feel able to handle.\nTo ease financial strain, plan now to build your project over a long period of time, say six months, on a pay-as-you-build basis.\nOnce you have a rough idea of your project\u2019s general form, don\u2019t dash into construction.\nVisit technical libraries and learn all you can about current professional work in the field, and its technical jargon. This will give you much important information and helpful hints, and when you finally face the judges, you will know your subject.\nHere is a prickly question. It is up to you to be realistic and honest with yourself when you choose a topic. Your science teachers and advisers will certainly be helpful, but the final decision must be yours. In other words, if you have never handled a soldering iron before, don\u2019t take on a project requiring elaborate electronic instrumentation. If you have enough time you can work up to a complex project by building a few simpler devices, like many described in EI. This is another reason for starting NOW. \u2013 Why not get your feet wet by assembling some test equipment from kits? You will certainly need a multimeter anyway, for any project, and it will be something you can use \u201cforever. \u201d\nAnother touchy subject: discussion of this often scares off good potential science fairers. Nobody requires or expects a science fair project to produce a radical new scientific discovery. However, this does not imply that an entrant can\u2019t find a new angle on an old problem. Merely duplicating a project described in a magazine shows the judges only one thing: the builder can follow directions. The main benefit of entering a science fair is the challenge of thinking a real problem out, all the way through. Your project can be for \u201cdemonstration\u201d rather than \u201cresearch, \u201d but make sure you come up with fresh, clear, meaningful ways to present your material. Stay away from last year\u2019s winning project: it was good last year. Avoid \u201cstaples\u201d (like Tesla coils) unless they are only part of a \u2018wider original project.\nYour project should be well presented and look impressive, but impressive need not mean expensive. Judges seldom look twice at an exhibit loaded down with excess and borrowed equipment when the same results could have been obtained more economically and without false show. Novel use of common materials shows creative ability, and this is an important judging criterion. Remember, how you solved your problem is what counts at a science fair, and not merely that you solved it. Also, neatness counts! Aside from being impossible to troubleshoot, a rat\u2019s nest of wiring is typical of losing projects. Time spent color-coding leads, installing wire harness and cable clamps will result in a much more attractive and more reliable project. But know what you are doing! Don\u2019t harness leads in a circuit that demands point-to-point wiring, or cable grid and plate leads together in an amplifier circuit. Read up on layout and construction techniques, and allow yourself time to make and correct mistakes. Prior planning will also pay off in dollars and cents, since you can save by purchasing some components (like resistors) in quantity, and if you live near a big city you can shop around for some items in the military surplus stores, modifying your design if necessary to take odd-value components. Now, sit back and start your thinking. The time to start is right now.\nIS YOUR WINNING PROJECT HERE?\nRADIO TELESCOPE: Home-built sensitive low-noise receiver, simple antenna system. Try to make simple \u201cradio map.\u201d\nGUIDANCE SYSTEM: For model ear. Can be programmed to run around science fair grounds without hitting anything, or to reach pre-chosen destination.\nSOLAR CELLS: Home-built unit as part of demonstration of basic physics of solar cells: display on recent professional research results: off-beat practical applications (eyeglass type hearing aid?).\nMOON MOUSE: \u201cTo be landed on the Moon. \u201d Self-propelled, radio controlled from Earth, instrumented and transmitter equipped.

{"text":"The Convention adjourned from July 26th to August 6th to allow the Committee of Detail \u2013 composed of John Rutledge of South Carolina, Edmund Randolph of Virginia, Nathaniel Gorham of Massachusetts, Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut, and James Wilson of Pennsylvania \u2013 to prepare a rough draft of a constitution, based on the series of resolutions the delegates had debated, amended, and debated again. When the Convention re-convened, the Committee of Detail presented its report, made up of twenty-three articles. The Convention spent the remainder of August reviewing and further revising these articles.\nWe the People of\u2026\nDelegates quickly agreed to accept the Committee of Detail\u2019s preamble and Articles I and II, affirming the new government would be called the Unites States of America and consist of Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches. This agreement masked the critical issue that the Convention had debated throughout \u2013 was this to be a union of states or of people? The Committee of Detail\u2019s constitution began, \u201cWe the people of the States (emphasis added) of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, South-Carolina, and Georgia, do ordain, declare, and establish the following Constitution for the Government of Ourselves and our Posterity.\u201d The Convention would not end with that language in the preamble.\nRepresentation: Who, What, and How Many?\nDiscussion of the Committee of Detail report continued to include the structure and powers of the legislative branch. Some of the key questions included: Who can elect representatives? How many representatives will there be? What will be their qualifications?\nDelegates debated whether to allow non-land owners to the right to vote for House members, or reserve the franchise to property owners. Gouverneur Morris wanted to restrict voting to those with property, considering them more educated and better able to choose wise leaders. \u201cThe ignorant and dependant,\u201d Morris stated, \u201ccan be\u2026 little trusted with the public interest.\u201d Colonel Mason countered arguments of this kind, saying all citizens should have equal voting rights and privileges. Doctor Franklin sided with Colonel Mason believing that restricting the right to vote to land owners would cause contention among the people. In the end Morris\u2019s proposal to restrict the franchise to property owners was defeated soundly (7-1-1).\nJust as the Convention rejected a plan to restrict voting to property owners, they also rejected a proposal to restrict elective office to property owners. South Carolina\u2019s Charles Pinckney moved that \u201cthe President of the U.S., the Judges, and members of the Legislature should be required to swear that they were respectively possessed of a cleared unencumbered Estate\u201d \u2013 in an amount to be agreed upon by members of the Convention. This proposal went nowhere. Benjamin Franklin expressed his \u201cdislike of every thing that tended to debase the spirit of the common people,\u201d and observed that \u201csome of the greatest rogues he was ever acquainted with, were the richest rogues.\u201d Madison reports that Pinckney\u2019s motion \u201cwas rejected by so general a no, that the States were not called.\u201d\nThe Convention did have a sentiment in favor of strong citizenship requirements for legislators. The Committee of Detail\u2019s report required members of the House be U.S. citizens for three years prior to election, and members of the Senate for four years. Some, including George Mason and Morris, agreed that a lengthy citizenship requirement would protect the legislature from foreign intrigue. Others, including Madison and Franklin, pointed to the number of foreign friends who had helped the states during the war for independence. Delegates sided with Mason and Morris, agreeing to requirements that members of the House be citizens for seven years and members of the Senate for nine years prior to election.\nOn the question of how many representatives would make up the national legislature, Article IV of the Committee of Detail Report stated that the House of Representatives would initially consist of sixty-five members, and that in the future, members of the House would be added \u201cat the rate of one for every forty thousand.\u201d Madison, expecting the Union to grow rapidly, thought that rate would quickly lead the House to grow too large. Others thought that time would make this issue irrelevant. Mr. Nathaniel Gorham from Massachusetts asked, \u201cCan it be supposed that this vast country including the Western territory will 150 years hence remain one nation? Mr. Oliver Ellsworth observed that \u201cIf the government should continue so long, alterations may be made in the Constitution\u201d through the amendment process. Delegates agreed to add the language \u201cnot exceeding\u201d to the one representative for 40,000 citizen ratio, making that a ceiling and not a floor. Controversy over this provision would re-emerge before the end of the Convention, however.\nThe Specter of Slavery\nLikewise, controversy would emerge about slavery. Consideration of the apportionment of representatives raised the question of whether slaves would be included within that ratio.

{"text":"What They Are and How to Learn More about the Appellate Courts and the Justices Who Serve on Them\nEvery four years, more than a third of California\u2019s 99 court of appeal justices face California voters for retention. In addition, several of the seven justices on the California Supreme Court face retention elections every four years. These are not contested elections; no one may run against the justices. Instead, the voters simply decide whether the justice shall continue to serve. If a majority of voters cast \"yes\" votes for a particular justice, that justice remains for another term. The Code of Judicial Ethics requires all judges \"to be faithful to the law regardless of partisan interests, public clamor or fear of criticism . . . .\" The retention election system, adopted by California voters as part of the State Constitution, is designed specifically to foster judges\u2019 independence from improper external pressures.\nBecause supreme court justices hold statewide offices, voters everywhere in California decide whether to retain them. In contrast, because court of appeal justices serve in districts, voters in each district alone decide whether to retain them. California\u2019s 99 court of appeal justices are divided among six districts, centered in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego, Fresno, and San Jose.\nSupreme and appellate court justices generally do not actively campaign for retention. The only promise they can make voters is to decide appeals impartially and according to the law, without fear or favor toward any individual or group. However, they do seek to provide helpful information to voters. The justices have worked closely and actively with the Secretary of State\u2019s Office to help the public learn more about the appellate courts, who the appellate justices are, and what they do.\nAs a consequence, voters everywhere in California can easily get biographical information on every justice who appears on the ballot. As to supreme court justices, the information is contained in the statewide ballot pamphlet sent to all voters by the Secretary of State. As to court of appeal justices, the official statewide voter pamphlet does not contain biographical sketches, but does refer voters to an Internet website and a toll-free telephone hotline so they may obtain justices\u2019 biographies, either on-line or through receipt of the Judicial Information Bookleton request. The Secretary of State\u2019s Internet website and Judicial Information Booklet also include brief descriptions of the appellate courts and how they differ from trial courts.\nTo gain access to these materials, voters may go to the Secretary of State\u2019s Internet website at http:\/\/www.ss.ca.gov\/ or call the telephone hotline at 1(800) 345-VOTE.\nWhile supreme and appellate court justices perform their roles quietly and without fanfare, the public can find much of their work published in law books titled \"California Reports,\" \"California Appellate Reports\" and \"California Reporter.\" Each of California\u2019s 58 counties has a public law library containing these books, as do law schools and most law offices. Recently issued opinions are available on the same day they are filed at 'Opinions' which is maintained by the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC), State of California.\nAdding to the data supplied by the Secretary of State, the Judicial Branch\u2019s website that you are currently reading from also contains biographical information about all the appellate court justices, as well as informative articles entitled \"How Appellate and Supreme Court Justices are Selected\" and \"What Appellate Justices Do.\"","id":"<urn:uuid:19b4e4f2-853a-4b46-baf8-25a9494b759b>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.courts.ca.gov\/selfhelp\/4192.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9415530562,"token_count":706,"score":2.609375,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Westat has applied our strong statistical, environmental, and data collection skills to design, conduct, and analyze environmental studies for more than 25 years. We have applied national field resources to the collection of environmental samples in homes, schools, and industrial facilities and coordinated analyses at specialized laboratories, following EPA's and our own quality assurance specifications.\nNational Children's Study (NCS)\nWestat has been awarded the contract to serve as the coordinating center for the National Children's Study (NCS) \u2014 the largest study ever undertaken within the United States to assess the effects of the environment on child and adult health. The full nationwide study would follow more than 100,000 children from prior to conception through adulthood, seeking information to prevent and treat such health problems as autism, birth defects, diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. Westat will collect data, compile and analyze statistics, and ensure that the study proceeds according to design.\nEnvironmental measures proposed for inclusion in the study include toxicants in air, water, and household dust and body burden data to be collected from urine, saliva, and blood. Toxicants to be studied include pesticides, metals, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), phytoestrogens, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and more.\nSix Vanguard Centers have been selected to pilot and complete the first phases of the study. The centers, which include a variety of universities, hospitals, health departments, and other organizations, will work within their communities to recruit participants, collect and process data, and pilot new research methods for incorporation into the full study.\nNCS is led by a consortium of Federal agency partners: the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (including the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences at the National Institutes of Health, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\nExposure Assessment and Environmental Epidemiology\nOur work in the area of exposure assessment and environmental epidemiology has included studies of exposure to pesticides, particulate matter, PCBs, heavy metals, and volatile organic compounds in a variety of populations, including children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised. Westat conducted the National Human Exposure Assessment Regional Survey in Maryland, a multimedia, multicontaminant field study of long-term exposure that included the collection of blood and urine samples for environmental exposure. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey now includes measurements of environmental exposure to dozens of contaminants through sampling of blood, urine, hair, and other body tissues and fluids. Other Westat environmental epidemiology studies include studies of the health effects relating to the following exposures:\n- Air pollution among the elderly in Maryland and California and school children in California and Texas;\n- Pesticides among children throughout the United States;\n- Microbial pathogens among bathers in recreational water;\n- Mercury in the seafood consumed by subsistence fishermen and women of childbearing age;\n- Indoor allergens in the homes and daycare centers of children throughout the United States; and\n- Asbestos in homes, schools, and commercial buildings throughout the United States.\nWater Quality has been the focus of several projects for the EPA. Westat has performed the following:\n- Evaluated the best technology available for minimizing the adverse environmental impact of cooling water intake structures;\n- Analyzed water quality impairment from concentrated animal feeding operations; and\n- Designed, conducted, and analyzed the results of industry surveys to determine whether current effluent guidelines were appropriate for current manufacturing technologies used in the iron and steel, meat products, and aquaculture industries.\nWestat's work in the area of lead hazards has included two national surveys of lead-based paint hazards in housing, an assessment of exposure to lead in child-care centers and homes, and the analysis of data on lead levels in soil. Our staff has performed the following:\n- Produced technical guidance documents on lead contamination of various media (soil, water, and dust);\n- Developed risk communication materials for the general public;\n- Designed a series of examinations to certify lead inspections;\n- Evaluated training programs designed to train janitors and others to work safely around lead paint; and\n- Designed a protocol for measuring the blood lead levels of children living in remediated housing.\nHealth and Environment Chapter of the EPA's State of the Environment Report\nWestat assisted EPA in preparing the health and environment chapter of the EPA's State of the Environment Report. Written in a style appropriate for the general public, yet in conformance with the standards of the health and environmental research communities, the report addresses the following:\n- Health status of the U.S. population;\n- Human exposure to environmental pollutants;\n- Diseases related to environmental pollution; and\n- Data gaps and emerging issues.\nHazardous Waste Survey\nFor the EPA's Office of Solid Waste, Westat designed and implemented the Hazardous Waste Survey.

{"text":"Joint use is a way to increase opportunities for children and adults to be more physically active. It refers to two or more entities \u2014 usually a school and a city or private organization \u2014 sharing indoor and outdoor spaces like gymnasiums, athletic fields and playgrounds. The concept is simple: share resources to keep costs down and communities healthy.\nExamples of joint use agreements:\nA principal unlocks the school gate after hours so neighbors can shoot hoops or play ball on evenings and weekends.\nA school and swim team share a pool.\nA school opens its soccer field to a local league for weekend games.\nA YMCA opens its gym to the local PE teacher so students have a place to exercise.\nWhy is joint use needed?\nThe research is clear: the more active children are, the healthier they will be now and when they grow up. Yet certain places make physical activity harder instead of easier. Place matters since experts now know that where we live, work and play \u2014 the physical environment itself \u2014 determines, to a large degree, whether we will be healthy.\nToo often, kids find the gate to their school\u2019s blacktop or basketball court locked after school hours, locking them out of opportunities to be active. Closing off recreational facilities after school leaves many children and families struggling to incorporate physical activity into their daily routines. They may live in an area without a nearby park or be unable to afford exercise equipment or a gym membership.\nJoint use agreements can fix these problems. Joint use makes physical activity easier by providing kids and adults alike with safe, conveniently located and inviting places to exercise and play. Besides making sense from a health perspective, joint use agreements make sense financially because they build upon assets a community already has. Sharing existing space is cheaper and more efficient than duplicating the same facilities in other parts of the community.\nWhere is joint use happening?\nJoint use is happening in cities throughout California and across the nation. In fact, the concept of joint use is not new. Schools have shared their land and facilities for community use for over 200 years. Most states, including California, have policies to encourage or require schools to make facilities open to the public. In California, a 2008 survey conducted by the Center for Cities and Schools revealed that close to 60 percent of responding school districts already have some type of joint use partnership, but thousands still do not.\nHow does it work?\nJoint use agreements facilitate a partnership between two or more entities, often school districts and local government agencies (e.g. parks and recreation or nonprofit organizations, to open up spaces such as playgrounds, athletic fields, pools, and gymnasiums to the community outside of school hours or to open up community facilities to schools at a reduced cost or for free.\nJoint use partnerships can be formal (based on a legal document) or informal (based on a handshake), but formal agreements offer increased protections for both the facility and the community group using the facility. Since school staffing can change over time, personal relationships are not the most secure way to guarantee access to facilities into the future. A formal agreement can also help prevent problems related to maintenance, operations, liability, ownership or cost from arising.\nMaintenance\u2013 How can we keep the space in good condition? Joint use agreements can detail each partner\u2019s goals to help ensure that school properties are respected and maintained. When school resources are being shared, it\u2019s important to have joint use agreements that specify who needs to make repairs and who will address wear and tear to the property. Some school officials have noticed a decrease in vandalism since implementing a joint use agreement. They have noted that when the community shares school resources, they take pride and ownership in the space, which can help deter vandalism.\nOperations \u2014 Who will unlock the gate? Who will run the programs? These questions can be answered with joint use agreements so that partners know what they are responsible for.\nLiability\u2013What if someone gets hurt? Experts say most schools\u2019 existing liability insurance is sufficient to cover any liability issues associated with joint use. Joint use agreements can identify liability concerns and make sure they are accounted for.\nOwnership\u2013 How does joint use affect how decisions are made about the property? Joint use agreements should outline a process for resolving any conflicts that may surface. They should also highlight how the partnership will benefit each party.\nCost\u2013 How expensive will the partnership be? Joint use agreements can be used to define how much each partner contributes. Partnerships do not need to cost a lot to be successful. Agreements can help partners anticipates what costs might be.","id":"<urn:uuid:5c29112c-9367-4cee-b67d-9c4fbd2fda01>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.jointuse.org\/resources\/joint-use-101\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.955776453,"token_count":940,"score":3.65625,"int_score":4}

Please take a look around and have a great day.\nHow Scouting Started in the United States\nOne day in 1909 in London, England, an American visitor, William D. Boyce, lost his way in a dense fog. He stopped under a street lamp and tried to figure out where he was. A boy approached him and asked if he could be of help.\nYou certainly can, said Boyce. He told the boy that he wanted to find a certain business office in the center of the city.\nI\u2019ll take you there, said the boy.\nWhen they got to the destination, Mr. Boyce reached into his pocket for a tip. But the boy stopped him.\nNo thank you, sir. I am a Scout. I won\u2019t take anything for helping.\nA Scout? And what might that be? asked Boyce.\nThe boy told the American about himself and about his brother scouts. Boyce became very interested. After finishing his errand, he had the boy take him to the British Scouting office.\nAt the office, Boyce met Lord Robert Baden-Powell, the famous British general who had founded the Scouting movement in Great Britain. Boyce was so impressed with what he learned that he decided to bring Scouting home with him.\nOn February 8, 1910, Boyce and a group of outstanding leaders founded the Boy Scouts of America. From that day forth, Scouts have celebrated February 8, as the birthday of Scouting in the United States.\nWhat happened to the boy who helped Mr. Boyce find his way in the fog? No one knows. He had neither asked for money nor given his name, but he will never be forgotten. His good turn helped bring the scouting movement to our country.\nIn the British Scout Training Center at Gilwell Park, England, Scouts from the United States erected a statue of an American Buffalo in honor of this unknown scout.

The report stems from a workshop held by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network (GCRMN) at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in the Republic of Panama, from 29 April-5 May 2012.\nAccording to the report, rates of decline on most reefs show no signs of slowing. However, many reefs in the Netherlands Antilles and Cayman Islands have 30% or more live coral cover. The causes of these regional differences in reef conditions are not well understood, beyond the role of human exploitation and disturbance.\nCarl Gustaf Lundin, Director, IUCN Global Marine and Polar Programme, notes that the major causes of coral decline include overfishing, pollution, disease, and bleaching caused by rising temperatures resulting from the burning of fossil fuels.\nIUCN has recommended local action to improve the health of corals, including limits on fishing through catch quotas, an extension of marine protected areas (MPAs), a halt to nutrient runoff from land, and a reduction on the global reliance on fossil fuels.

{"text":"Two teachers at Norview High School in Norfolk, VA were recently put on administrative leave by the school after a parent complained about a video that she saw in Government class. The video informed its audience on how to assert their constitutional rights during various encounters with police, such as during a car or house search. It was accompanied by a one page handout about a person\u2019s rights when stopped and arrested by the police. When the girl came home after school that day, she told her mother \u201cYou won\u2019t believe what we are learning in Government. They are teaching us how to hide our drugs.\u201d The woman promptly called the school to complain about what was taught to her daughter, and the teachers were subsequently suspended.\nThere are two things that are rather irksome about these series of events. First, why are parents are so ready to jump to conclusions and act on those assumptions? It\u2019s a little hard to believe that teachers would be lecturing their students on the best way to hide drugs from the police. If the girl\u2019s mother had just inquired as to what was actually taught that day, it would have been clear that this was Government class as usual, just an exercise in educating youth on the Constitution.\nSecond, and more importantly, why are schools eager to appease parents at the drop of a hat? These are institutions filled with education professionals: teachers know what their students should learn and what the appropriate materials for teaching them are. A school\u2019s administration should trust that the teacher is making reasonable choices as to how a child is taught and with what. In response to a parent\u2019s complaint, they should first research the allegations. The administration at Norview High School, for instance, could have a gotten a copy of the leaflet given to students. They also could have watched the video to see if anything inappropriate was shown. Instead, the school acquiesced to the demands of one uninformed parent. Sometimes, Mother doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s best. That\u2019s why we have schools and teachers.\nUnfortunately, this is not a new problem. Schools all over the country have bowed down to raging parents over something they don\u2019t think is appropriate for their child. It\u2019s a distressing thought that a parent\u2019s misunderstanding about a certain book or a particular lesson in school can translate into a child\u2019s incomplete education. Learning about an individual\u2019s constitutional rights enhances one\u2019s education and can even make for a better citizen. School administrators need to have more confidence in themselves and their teachers. They need to stick to what they believe is important for a child\u2019s education.","id":"<urn:uuid:a4dee370-849c-4c50-bca2-fa569742a920>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/ncacblog.wordpress.com\/2010\/06\/09\/teachers-get-in-trouble-for-teaching-students-about-their-constitutional-rights\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9836153984,"token_count":549,"score":2.5625,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Increasing Local Contrast\nThe previous section showed adjustments to the brightness and contrast of the entire image. The adjustment changes every pixel of original brightness value A to the same final brightness value B, regardless of the pixel\u2019s neighbors. Another class of operations increases the visibility of local differences between pixels, by suppressing the longer-range variations. These neighborhood functions use a moving neighborhood, usually a small circle, that compares or combines the central pixel and the neighbors to produce a new value that is assigned to the central pixel to construct a new image. Then the neighborhood shifts to the next pixel and the process is repeated. These calculations are applied to the pixel brightness values in a color coordinate system such as HSI or LAB that leaves the color values unchanged.\nFor instance, local equalization functions just like the histogram equalization procedure, except that it takes place within a moving circular neighborhood and assigns a new value only to the central pixel. The result makes a pixel that is slightly brighter than its surroundings brighter still, and vice-versa, enhancing local contrast. The result is usually added back in some proportion to the original image to produce a more visually pleasing result, as shown in the Local Equalization interactive Java tutorial.\nSharpening of images to increase local contrast is almost universally applied by publishers to counter the visual blurring effect of halftoning images in the printing process. This is usually done by a convolution using a kernel of weights, just as the Gaussian smoothing function shown above. But in this application, some of those weights will have negative values. For instance, the Laplacian sharpening filter in Table 1 combines each pixel with its eight adjacent neighbors as shown in the Laplacian Sharpening interactive Java tutorial.\nA more flexible extension of this basic idea is the widely used (and as often misused) unsharp mask. The name derives from a century-old darkroom procedure that required printing the original image at 1:1 magnification but out of focus onto another piece of film (this was the unsharp mask), and then placing the two films together to print the final result. Where the original negative was dense, the mask was not (and vice versa) so that little light was transmitted, except near detail and edges where the mask was out of focus.\nThe same effect can be produced in the computer by applying a Gaussian blur to a duplicate of the original and then subtracting it from the original. The difference between the two images is just the detail and edges removed by the blurring. The original image is then added back to the difference to increase the visibility of the details while suppressing the overall image contrast. In the Unsharp Masking interactive Java tutorial, the result image is automatically scaled to the range of the display so that negative values that can result from the calculation are not lost.\nOne of the characteristics of the unsharp mask is the formation of bright and dark \u201chaloes\u201d adjacent to the dark and bright borders (respectively) of structure in the image. This increases their visibility, but can hide other nearby information. A related approach using neighborhood ranking rather than Gaussian blurring alleviates this problem. The method applies a median filter to remove fine detail, subtracts this from the original to isolate the detail, and then adds the original image back to enhance the visibility as shown in the Rank Masking interactive Java tutorial. This method is called a rank mask, but is sometimes (incorrectly) referred to as a top hat filter (the real top hat is shown below).\nNote that all of these local enhancement methods are very noise sensitive, because both random speckle and shot noise produce pixels that are different from their local neighborhood. Image noise must be removed before enhancement is attempted, or the visibility of the noise will be increased as shown in the Comparison of Local Contrast Enhancement Methods interactive Java tutorial.\nThe top hat filter is also a based on neighborhood ranking, but unlike the procedure above it uses the ranked value from two different size regions. The brightest value in a circular interior region is compared to the brightest value in a surrounding annular region. If the brightness difference exceeds a threshold level, it is kept (otherwise it is erased). The Top Hat Filter interactive Java tutorial shows the filter\u2019s operation. If the interior and annular regions are drawn as shown in the diagram in Figure 1, the reason for the filter name becomes apparent. The interior region is the crown and the threshold is its height, while the surrounding annulus is the brim of the hat. This operation is particularly well suited for finding the spikes in Fourier transform power spectra, as illustrated previously.\nThe top hat is also good for locating any features of a known size by adjusting the radius of the crown. Objects too large to fit into the crown of the hat are selectively removed. Reversing the logic to use the darkest values in both regions enables the same procedure to isolate dust or other dark features. By replacing the interior value by the mean of the surroundings, the dust can be selectively removed. In this application, shown in the Rolling Ball Filter interactive Java tutorial, the method is called a rolling ball filter.\nJohn C.

Instead, this is supported using the i (PCRE_CASELESS) pattern modifier. Other pattern modifiers are also available for changing the matching strategy.\n- The POSIX functions find the longest of the leftmost match, but PCRE stops on the first valid match. If the string doesn't match at all it makes no difference, but if it matches it may have dramatic effects on both the resulting match and the matching speed. To illustrate this difference, consider the following example from \"Mastering Regular Expressions\" by Jeffrey Friedl. Using the pattern one(self)?(selfsufficient)? on the string oneselfsufficient with PCRE will result in matching oneself, but using POSIX the result will be the full string oneselfsufficient. Both (sub)strings match the original string, but POSIX requires that the longest be the result.\nadd a note User Contributed Notes Differences from POSIX regex - [1 notes]\njasen at treshna dot com \u00b6\n1 year ago","id":"<urn:uuid:31708733-dbee-47f1-88c5-054e01a19ca2>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/fr2.php.net\/manual\/en\/reference.pcre.pattern.posix.php","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.8179521561,"token_count":362,"score":2.5625,"int_score":3}

We have directly compared the effect of 21 types of chemical modifications on siRNA activity and toxicity in a total of 2160 siRNA duplexes.

Collectively, our results provide unique insights into the tolerance for chemical modifications and provide a simple guide to successful chemical modification of siRNAs with improved activity, stability and low toxicity.","id":"<urn:uuid:b5654d8e-0f08-4bf6-9a7c-6fd03e5fe0e7>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/publikationen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de\/solrsearch\/index\/search\/searchtype\/authorsearch\/author\/%22Dalibor+Odad%C5%BEi%C4%87%22\/start\/0\/rows\/10\/subjectfq\/PASSENGER-STRAND+","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.8938946724,"token_count":233,"score":2.734375,"int_score":3}
{"text":"CDC's Office on Disability and Health focuses on the prevention of secondary conditions and health promotion among persons with disabilities. Emphasis is on scientific support for surveillance of disabilities, cost-effectiveness of prevention strategies focused on secondary conditions and health promotion activities, and identifying risk and protective factors for secondary conditions. This is implemented through providing funds to states for public health activities addressing the needs of persons with disabilities. The program emphasizes secondary conditions which cross diagnostic categories, and focus on broader disability areas. This is a relatively new approach to prevention programs for CDC, which historically focused on the primary prevention of disabling conditions. The program is focusing on activities that will enhance the ability to measure performance in this new area. This performance measure reflects a first step toward building a data collection system that will enable CDC to monitor trends related to health and quality of life among people with disabilities.\nPerformance Goals and Measures\nPerformance Goal: By 2002, a national network will exist that will provide all states with better access to data on disabilities for their use in analyzing the needs of people with disabling conditions.\n|FY Baseline||FY 1999 Appropriated||FY 2000 Estimate|\n|0 (1997).||By 1999, the number of states who have begun using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) disability module will be increased to 15.||By 2000, the number of states who have begun using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) disability module will be increased to 25.|\nCurrently, there is not a data collection system in place that could be used to measure outcomes that focus on actual improvements in the quality of life of people with disabling conditions. As a result, the performance measure that has been selected for this program involves the nationwide implementation of a data collection system by the year 2002. We believe that, although challenging, nationwide implementation of the BRFSS' disability module by 2002 is feasible. However, this represents a change in direction for CDC's disabilities program, which previously focused on preventing primary disabilities. As part of on-going strategic planning efforts, the program has refocused its efforts on promoting health and improving quality of life among people with disabilities. 1997 is the first year that CDC has funded states to address these issues. As a result, the program is focusing on activities that will enhance the ability to measure performance in this new area. Tracking of the implementation of this data collection system will be accomplished through a requirement that all CDC state grantees report on whether they are utilizing the module. The cost of this data collection effort will be minimal.\nVerification\/Validation of Performance Measures: This performance measure will be verified by reviews of the reports required by cooperative agreement recipients.\nLinks to DHHS Strategic Plan\nThis objective is closely linked to DHHS Goal 5: Improve public health systems.","id":"<urn:uuid:a529888e-a478-47b2-8761-75809ef8d263>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/program\/performance\/fy2000plan\/2000xiidisabl.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9357686043,"token_count":564,"score":2.59375,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Assessing Students' Understanding of Complex Systems\nAssessing student understanding of complex thinking is quite challenging. As with assessing student learning on any topic, the first step is to identify your learning goals for your students. Once you have identified learning goals, it becomes easier to choose one or more assessment tools appropriate to the task.\nHere is a list of possible learning objectives related to students' thinking about complex systems (i.e., skills expected from students who exhibit complex systems thinking). While this is in no way intended to be a comprehensive list of possible learning goals, it may help you to articulate your own list.\nA student who demonstrates complex systems thinking can:\n- Identify and explain the characteristics of a complex system\n- Describe and\/or model a process where there is a feedback mechanism at work\n- Build a model that mimics the expected behavior of the target system\n- Identify stocks\/reservoirs and flows\n- Correctly identify positive\/negative feedbacks\n- Test a model through trial and error and comparison to real-world data\n- Explore the possible outcomes of a system under different parameters\n- Bridge across scales: student explanations of processes show fidelity across scales (e.g., a student applies the concept of homeostasis at multiple levels)\n- Create and interpret graphical information\n- Predict attributes of system behavior based on specific inputs or components of the system\n- Understand that a complex system is irreducible, unpredictable, historical, nonlinear, and has emergent properties, and be able to describe what these terms mean\nA number of assessment tools can be used to assess students' understanding (or progress toward understanding) of complex systems. A few of these tools are listed below.\nA concept map is a diagram with hierarchical nodes, labeled with concepts. The nodes are linked together with directional lines and are arranged from general to specific. By developing concept maps, students literally illustrate their understanding of a complex system. This method can be used for summative or formative assessment, and has the benefit of highlighting any misconceptions.\nStudents can develop and run physical or computer models to gain an understanding of how a system works. The choices a student makes in developing a model (what components of the system to include, how they are linked, and so on), along with how the student explains his or her choices, illustrate that student's understanding of the system in question. Their ability to explain the behavior of the model (describe the outcomes given different inputs, find patterns in the output, etc.) offers further opportunity for assessment. This method can be employed for summative or formative assessment (or both).\nAn understanding of graphical representations of data is an essential component of data analysis. Students can demonstrate their understanding of complex systems by interpreting graphical data illustrating the relationships between system variables. This method can be employed for summative or formative assessment (or both). For more information about using graphs in the classroom, see the Starting Point web pages on describing and analyzing graphs.\nAssessing Students' Thinking Processes\nMuch frustration can be avoided by engaging in formative assessment: assessing student learning during the learning process. One way to do this is to incorporate several \"checkpoints\" in each teaching activity or assignment where you ask students to articulate what the results are and how they got there. This serves two functions: 1) it exposes misconceptions or misapplications at an early stage, and 2) it requires students to think about what they are doing and why -- and whether their progress makes sense in the context of what they know or expect. This opens up the realm of metacognition, wherein students think specifically about their own learning and engage in self-monitoring and self-regulatory behavior. Research demonstrates that metacognition improves learning (Lovett, 2008 ).","id":"<urn:uuid:2e8b8aa5-69b0-451f-a0f1-f733ed427b6e>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/serc.carleton.edu\/NAGTWorkshops\/complexsystems\/assessing.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9254475236,"token_count":773,"score":3.65625,"int_score":4}

{"text":"Debt Ceiling to allow U.S. Debt to hit historic level in early 2013\nWhile there have been and continue to be a significant number of hands wringing over the fiscal cliff , which takes effect on December 31, perhaps the REAL issue is coming very early in 2013: the U.S. Debt Ceiling.\nThe fiscal cliff is being discussed on every business report on television, radio, Internet blogs and print media. As you most likely know, fiscal cliff is the name given to the event associated with the simultaneous expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts, the increase in the payroll tax and the immediate reduction of federal government spending. For reference, here are links to APMEX\u2019s special reports n the fiscal cliff.\nFiscal Cliff is but the Beginning\nWhile the sudden and significant impact of multiple changes in the economy is surely creating anxiety and uncertainty in both the personal lives and business of Americans, this is likely only the beginning of issues as the United States begins to respond to the \u201cnew normal\u201d following the Great Recession.\nHowever, the next increase in the federal debt ceiling \u2013 the maximum amount the U.S. may borrow as set by Congress \u2013 will establish the maximum U.S. Federal Debt at about $18 trillion. While this is, of course, a huge level of debt and the largest debt of any country, the U.S. also has the world\u2019s largest economy.\nThe question that each country must address is \u201cHow much debt can this country afford?\u201d The answer depends on a number of factors and is often measured in the ratio of debt to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the borrowing country. Historically, for the U.S., this ratio has generally been between 30 percent and 65 percent, from 1950 until the beginning of the Great Recession in 2008.\nU.S. Debt is at Historically High and Dangerous Levels\nWhen the next debt ceiling is set by Congress, most likely in early 2013, presuming borrowing to the ceiling and low GDP growth, the U.S. Debt to U.S. GDP ratio will most likely be about 120 percent, a level more than double the historical levels since 1950.\nHow does this compare to other countries? Below is a table of several key countries around the world. Also, here is a complete list of countries with Debt to GDP levels provided by the International Monetary Fund.\nThe History and the Current Status of the U.S. Debt Ceiling\nDuring World War I in 1917, the U.S. Congress passed a law requiring Congressional approval on the aggregate debt outstanding of the United States. Prior to this, Congress was required to approve each and every debt offering. Since 1950, there have been 95 changes to the debt ceiling; since 2000 there have been 13 changes, or about one per year. You can read about the History of the U.S. Debt Ceiling or see a listing of all changes to the U.S. Debt Ceiling, use Table 7.3.\nSince 2000, the increases in the U.S. Debt Ceiling have been larger than in previous years as the United States borrowed more to finance the 2000 dot-com bust, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the Federal support of the Great Recession of 2007\u20132008.\nThe current status of the U.S. Public Debt and the Debt Limit is shown in the charts below. The U.S. Debt has increased by more than 15 percent since January 2011. The current U.S. Debt is very close to the U.S. Debt Ceiling of about $16.5 trillion and, accordingly, Congress will be required to take action very soon.\nThe U.S. Debt has increased $2.1 trillion, or about 15percent, in just two years since January 2011. Despite the large increase, the Federal Government has almost borrowed to the limit.\nThe U.S. Debt Ceiling must be raised in the very near future, most likely in a few months. As the chart below shows, at the end of October 2012, only about $172 billion remained available under the U.S. Debt Ceiling. In November 2011, federal borrowing increased by $119 billion, and if that were the borrowing rate for November 2012, almost all of the available U.S. Debt availability would be consumed.\nNote: In an article in The Wall Street Journalon December 12, 2003, it was reported that the U.S. Treasury currently has only about $67 billion remaining in borrowing capacity.\nThe red line represents the total borrowing capacity of the United States that is above the current aggregate outstanding U.S. Debt. Since January 2012, U.S. borrowing has increased such that the remaining availability has declined each month , leaving the availability in November 2012 at just $172 billion. Here is the U.S. Treasury Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States.\nGold and the U.S. Debt in 2012 and Beyond\nWith much debate on the fiscal cliff and future debate on the debt ceiling, the end result will be that the U.S. will most likely continue to be in a period of very high federal debt relative to the GDP. This relationship cannot be changed in a year and perhaps not even in five years.\nThe Europeans are ahead of the United States in addressing their debt to GDP issues with Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Italy. Spain will most likely become a problem as well. The solution in Europe has been the same as the solution in the U.S.: the Central Banks create more currency to keep the economy from falling even further.\nA recent article in Barron\u2019s, titled \u201cIs Bad News Still Good News for Gold?\u201d Randall Forsyth, the author, in the last paragraph says\nAs long as authorities try to do whatever it takes to hold the system of fiat currencies and indebted governments from flying apart, paper money will continue to lose value relative to the traditional store of value, gold.","id":"<urn:uuid:c505c2e6-2111-4528-9e20-3531f0540c72>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/blog.apmex.com\/2012\/12\/18\/special-report-fiscal-cliff-u-s-debt-ceiling-is-the-real-issue\/?like=1&source=post_flair&_wpnonce=c1ce40f6e1","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9578103423,"token_count":1228,"score":2.921875,"int_score":3}
{"text":"It's normal for parents to disagree and argue from time to time. Parents might disagree about money, home chores, or how to spend time. They might disagree about big things \u2014 like important decisions they need to make for the family. They might even disagree about little things that don't seem important at all \u2014 like what's for dinner or what time someone gets home.\nSometimes parents can disagree with each other and still manage to talk about it in a calm way, where both people get a chance to listen and to talk. But many times when parents disagree, they argue. An argument is a fight using words.\nMost kids worry when their parents argue. Loud voices and angry words parents might use can make kids feel scared, sad, or upset. Even arguments that use silence \u2014 like when parents act angry and don't talk to each other at all \u2014 can be upsetting for kids.\nIf the argument has anything to do with the kids, kids might think they have caused their parents to argue and fight. If kids think it's their fault, they might feel guilty or even more upset. But parents' behavior is never the fault of kids.\nWhat Does It Mean When Parents Fight?\nKids often worry about what it means when parents fight. They might jump to conclusions and think arguments mean their parents don't love each other anymore. They might think it means their parents will get a divorce.\nBut parents' arguments usually don't mean that they don't love each other or that they're getting a divorce. Most of the time the arguments are just a way to let off steam when parents have a bad day or feel stressed out over other things. Most people lose their cool now and then.\nJust like kids, when parents get upset they might cry, yell, or say things they don't really mean. Sometimes an argument might not mean anything except that one parent or both just lost their temper. Just like kids, parents might argue more if they're not feeling their best or are under a lot of stress from a job or other worries.\nKids usually feel upset when they see or hear parents arguing. It's hard to hear the yelling and the unkind words. Seeing parents upset and out of control can make kids feel unprotected and scared.\nKids might worry about one parent or the other during an argument. They might worry that one parent may feel especially sad or hurt because of being yelled at by the other parent. They might worry that one parent seems angry enough to lose control. They might worry that their parent might be angry with them, too, or that someone might get hurt.\nSometimes parents' arguments make kids cry or give them a stomachache. Worry from arguments can even make it hard for a kid to go to sleep or go to school.\nWhat to Do When Parents Fight\nIt's important to remember that the parents are arguing or fighting, not the kids. So the best thing to do is to stay out of the argument and go somewhere else in the house to get away from the fighting or arguing. So go to your room, close the door, find something else to do until it is over. It's not the kid's job to be a referee.\nWhen Parents' Fighting Goes Too Far\nWhen parents argue, there can be too much yelling and screaming, name calling, and too many unkind things said. Even though many parents may do this, it's never OK to treat people in your family with disrespect, use unkind words, or yell and scream at them.\nSometimes parents' fighting may go too far, and include pushing and shoving, throwing things, or hitting. These things are never OK. When parents' fights get physical in these ways, the parents need to learn to get their anger under control. They might need the help of another adult to do this.\nKids who live in families where the fighting goes too far can let someone know what's going on. Talking to other relatives, a teacher, a school counselor, or any adult you trust about the fighting can be important.\nSometimes parents who fight can get so out of control that they hurt each other, and sometimes kids can get hurt, too. If this happens, kids can let an adult know, so that the family can be helped and protected from fighting in a way that hurts people.\nIf fighting is out of control in a family, if people are getting hurt from fighting, or if people in the family are tired of too much fighting, there is help. Family counselors and therapists know how to help families work on problems, including fighting.\nThey can help by teaching family members to listen to each other and talk about feelings without yelling and screaming. Though it may take some work, time, and practice, people in families can always learn to get along better.\nIs It OK for Parents to Argue Sometimes?\nHaving arguments once in a while can be healthy if it helps people get feelings out in the open instead of bottling them up inside. It's important for people in a family to be able to tell each other how they feel and what they think, even when they disagree. The good news about disagreeing is that afterward people usually understand each other better and feel closer.\nParents fight for different reasons. Maybe they had a bad day at work, or they're not feeling well, or they're really tired. Just like kids, when parents aren't feeling their best, they can get upset and might be more likely to argue. Most of the time, arguments are over quickly, parents apologize and make up, and everyone feels better again.\nHappy, Healthy Families\nNo family is perfect. Even in the happiest home, problems pop up and people argue from time to time. Usually, the family members involved get what's bothering them out in the open and talk about it. Everyone feels better, and life can get back to normal.\nBeing part of a family means everyone pitches in and tries to make life better for each other. Arguments happen and that's OK, but with love, understanding, and some work, families can solve almost any problem.","id":"<urn:uuid:12d027d4-f1ad-47d0-baaa-eea0edc16cc9>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/kidshealth.org\/PageManager.jsp?dn=RadyChildrensHospital&lic=102&cat_id=20068&article_set=22653&ps=304","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9713375568,"token_count":1240,"score":3.28125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"A testosterone test measures the blood level of the male sex hormone testosterone. Testosterone, which plays an important role in sexual development, is produced mainly by the testes in boys and in much smaller amounts by the ovaries in girls. Testosterone is also produced by the adrenal glands in both girls and boys.\nIn young boys, testosterone levels are normally low. As puberty approaches \u2014 usually between the ages of 10 and 14 \u2014 the pituitary gland (a pea-sized gland near the base of the brain) secretes two hormones (luteinizing hormone, or LH; and follicle-stimulating hormone, or FSH) that work together to stimulate the testes to make testosterone.\nIncreased testosterone production is what causes boys to develop deeper voices, bigger muscles, and body and facial hair. It also helps the testes produce sperm, and it plays a role in speeding a boy's growth in height during puberty.\nTwo separate assessments may be performed as part of a testosterone test:\ntotal testosterone, which measures the entire amount of testosterone in the body, including both the amount bound to proteins that help transport the hormone through the bloodstream and free testosterone\nfree testosterone, which measures only the testosterone that's not attached to proteins\nThe doctor may order one or both tests. However, because sexual development involves many other hormones, a more complete picture can often be obtained by performing other tests at the same time, including an LH or FSH test. For example, low levels of testosterone can be due to a problem with the testes' production of testosterone or to the pituitary gland not making enough of the hormones that stimulate the testes to produce testosterone.\nWhy It's Done\nDoctors may order a testosterone blood test if a boy appears to be entering puberty earlier or later than expected. High levels are associated with precocious (early) puberty, while low levels may indicate a delay in sexual development. In girls, high levels can be associated with the appearance of masculine characteristics, such as facial hair.\nThe test may also be used in either boys or girls to check for damage or disease of the testes, ovaries, adrenal glands, or pituitary gland, or to check for steroid use.\nIn teens and adults, testosterone levels can help doctors evaluate fertility or menstrual problems and sexual function.\nNo special preparations are needed for this test. The doctor may want to perform the test in the morning, when testosterone levels usually are highest.\nOn the day of the test, it may help to have your child wear a short-sleeve shirt to allow easier access for the technician who will be drawing the blood.\nA health professional will clean the skin surface with antiseptic, and place an elastic band (tourniquet) around the upper arm to apply pressure and cause the veins to swell with blood. Then a needle is inserted into a vein (usually in the arm inside of the elbow or on the back of the hand) and blood is withdrawn and collected in a vial or syringe.\nAfter the procedure, the elastic band is removed. Once the blood has been collected, the needle is removed and the area is covered with cotton or a bandage to stop the bleeding. Collecting blood for this test will only take a few minutes.\nWhat to Expect\nCollecting a sample of blood is only temporarily uncomfortable and can feel like a quick pinprick. Afterward, there may be some mild bruising, which should go away in a few days.\nThe blood sample will be processed by a machine and the results are commonly available after a few days.\nThe testosterone test is considered a safe procedure. However, as with many medical tests, some problems can occur with having blood drawn:\nfainting or feeling lightheaded\nhematoma (blood accumulating under the skin causing a lump or bruise)\npain associated with multiple punctures to locate a vein\nHelping Your Child\nHaving a blood test is relatively painless. Still, many children are afraid of needles. Explaining the test in terms your child can understand might help ease some of the fear.\nAllow your child to ask the technician any questions he or she might have. Tell your child to try to relax and stay still during the procedure, as tensing muscles and moving can make it harder and more painful to draw blood. It also may help if your child looks away when the needle is being inserted into the skin.\nIf You Have Questions\nIf you have questions about the testosterone test, speak with your doctor.","id":"<urn:uuid:aafb4e60-d364-46e2-b7de-0991f82b4eb1>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/kidshealth.org\/PageManager.jsp?dn=BannerHealth&lic=160&cat_id=174&article_set=63300&ps=104","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.938770175,"token_count":925,"score":3.703125,"int_score":4}

{"text":"Hundred Years' War (1369\u201389)\n||This article includes a list of references, but its sources remain unclear because it has insufficient inline citations. (May 2012)|\n|Hundred Years' War (1369-1389)|\n|Part of Hundred Years' War|\nThe Battle of Najera\n| Kingdom of France\nCrown of Castile\n|Kingdom of England|\n|Commanders and leaders|\n| Charles V of France\nCharles VI of France\n| Edward III of England\nRichard II of England\n|Casualties and losses|\nThe Caroline War was the second phase of the Hundred Years' War between France and England, following the Edwardian War. It was so-named after Charles V of France, who resumed the war after the Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny (signed 1360). In May 1369, the Black Prince, son of Edward III of England, refused an illegal summons from the French king demanding he come to Paris and Charles responded by declaring war. He immediately set out to reverse the territorial losses imposed at Br\u00e9tigny and he was largely successful in his lifetime. His successor, Charles VI, made peace with the son of the Black Prince, Richard II, in 1389. This truce was extended many times until the war was resumed in 1415.\nThe reign of Charles V saw the English steadily pushed back. Although the English-backed claimant to the Duchy of Brittany, John of Montfort, defeated and killed the French claimant, Charles of Blois, at the Battle of Auray in 1364, John and his heirs eventually reconciled with the French kings. The War of the Breton Succession ended in favour of the English, but gave them no great advantage. In fact, the French received the benefit of improved generalship in the person of the Breton commander Bertrand du Guesclin, who, leaving Brittany, entered the service of Charles and became one of his most successful generals.\nAt about the same time, a war in Spain occupied the Black Prince's efforts from 1366. The Castilian Civil War pitted Pedro the Cruel, whose daughters Constance and Isabella were married to the Black Prince's brothers John of Gaunt and Edmund of Langley, against Henry of Trast\u00e1mara. In 1369, with the support of Du Guesclin, Henry deposed Pedro to become Henry II of Castile. He then went to war with England, which was allied with Portugal.\nTwenty years of war \nJust before New Year's Day 1370, the English seneschal of Poitou, John Chandos, was killed at the bridge at Lussac-les-Ch\u00e2teaux. The loss of this commander was a significant blow to the English. Jean III de Grailly, the captal de Buch, was also captured and locked up by Charles, who did not feel bound by \"outdated\" chivalry. Du Guesclin continued a series of careful campaigns, avoiding major English field forces, but capturing town after town, including Poitiers in 1372 and Bergerac in 1377. Du Guesclin, who according to chronicler Jean Froissart, had advised the French king not to engage the English in the field, was successful in these Fabian tactics, though in the only two major battles in which he fought, Auray (1364) and N\u00e1jera (1367), he was on the losing side and was captured but released for ransom. The English response to Du Guesclin was to launch a series of destructive military expeditions, called chevauch\u00e9es, in an effort at total war to destroy the countryside and the productivity of the land. But Du Guesclin refused to be drawn into open battle. He continued his successful command of the French armies until his death in 1380.\nIn 1372, English dominance at sea, which had been upheld since the Battle of Sluys, was reversed, at least in the Bay of Biscay, by the disastrous defeat by a joint Franco-Castilian fleet at the Battle of La Rochelle. This defeat undermined English seaborne trade and supplies and threatened their Gascon possessions.\nIn 1376, the Black Prince died, and in April 1377, Edward III of England sent his Chancellor, Adam Houghton, to negotiate for peace with Charles, but when in June Edward himself died, Houghton was called home. The underaged Richard of Bordeaux succeeded to the throne of England. It was not until Richard had been deposed by his cousin Henry Bolingbroke that the English, under the House of Lancaster, could forcefully revive their claim to the French throne. The war nonetheless continued until the first of a series of truces was signed in 1389.\nCharles V died in September 1380 and was succeeded by his underage son, Charles VI, who was placed under the joint regency of his three uncles. On his deathbed Charles V repealed the royal taxation necessary to fund the war effort. As the regents attempted to reimpose the taxation a popular revolt known as the Harelle broke out in Rouen. As tax collectors arrived at other French cities the revolt spread and violence broke out in Paris and most of France's other northern cities. The regency was forced to repeal the taxes to calm the situation.\nSee also \n- Ormrod, W., (2002). Edward III. History Today. Vol. 52(6), 20 pgs.\n- Ayton, A., (1992).

{"text":"PHP, while originally designed and built to run on Unix, has had the ability since version 3 to run on Windows. That includes 9x, ME, NT, and 2000. In this article I'm going to go through the process of installing PHP on Windows and explain what you should look out for.\nOn Windows, as on Unix, you have two options for installing PHP: as a CGI or as an ISAPI module. The obvious benefit of the latter is speed. The downside is that this is still somewhat new and may not be as stable. But, before you do anything, you have to do some prep work, which is pretty simple. Once you've downloaded and unzipped the Windows binary version of PHP, you have to copy\nphp4isapi.dll from the sapi\/ directory to WINNT\/system or WINDOWS\/system directories. You'll also probably want to move\nphp.ini-dist from your installation directory to the\nWINDOWS\/ directory and rename it to\nphp.ini, if you plan on changing any of the precompiled defaults. Now you're ready to go, regardless of whether you use PHP as a CGI or ISAPI module.\nFor NT\/2000, you'll need to tell IIS how to recognize PHP. Thanks to the wonders of GUI, this can easily be accomplished with a few mouse clicks. First, fire up the Microsoft Management Console or Internet Service Manager, depending on whether you're using NT or 2000. Click on the Properties button of the web node you'll be working with. In this example we'll use Default Web Server. Click the ISAPI Filters tab and then click Add. Use\nphp as the name and in the path put the location of\nphp4isapi.dll, which should be\nC:\\WINNT\\system\\ in this example.\nConfiguring IIS to recognize PHP.\nUnder the Home Directory tab, click the Configuration button, then click Add for Application Mappings. Use the same location of\nphp4isapi.dll as you did with ISAP Filters and use\n.php as the extension. Here comes the caveat!! As a test, I tried using as my path the temporary location of\nphp4isapi.dll, which was in the install directory on my desktop. Windows 2000 popped up a wonderfully annoying little box telling me I'm stupid and I should go dunk my head in the sand. OK, so it wasn't quite that wordy, but that's how I took it. Apparently Windows 2000 and IIS require App Mappings to be under the WINDOWS dir at least. So keep that in mind if you don't like sand up your nose.\nNow, click OK on the Properties dialog. The next thing to do is start and stop IIS. This isn't the same as pushing the stop and start buttons on the Management Console. You should go to a command (or cmd, as it were) window and type\nnet stop issadmin. Wait for it to tell you what it's doing, as if you were nosy enough to care, and then type\nnet start w3svc. Why they didn't make it\nnet start iisadmin is beyond me. But I'm a Unix guy, and logic seems to be my downfall here. But I digress...\nSo now you have PHP installed as an ISAPI module on Windows! Aren't you happy? Probably not, because you probably don't believe me. Well, if you need proof just go to\nC:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\ and put a file called\ntest.php in there. Inside that file put the following code:\n<?php phpinfo(); ?>\nThen pull up\ntest.php in your browser. If you see the PHP Info page, it worked! Now this probably goes without saying, so I'll say it. You have to pull up\ntest.php as a web page in the browser using\nhttp:\/\/. If you give the path for the file using\nfile:\/\/, then you'll get a raw output of the code, which is no fun.\nThe PHP Info page indicates success.\nOn Windows 9x\/ME, you're somewhat restricted to PWS (Personal Web Server). Of course there are alternatives such as OmniHTTPd, but we don't have all day here! Anyway, this is far simpler. It's mainly just a matter of a registry entry.\nAfter you've moved\nphp4ts.dll to the appropriate directories, you should open up your favorite registry editor. At this point I note the obligatory warnings about fooling around with the registry, blah, blah, blah... In\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\w3svc\\parameters\\Script Map, you'll want to add an entry with the name of\n.php and a value of\nNext, go start up the PWS Manager. For each of the directories that you want to make PHP aware, you have to right-click on that directory and check the executable box.\nNow you're ready. Perform the same test (\ntest.php) as I described above, and have fun making all those ASP cronies jealous at the the guru-like glow that surrounds you!\nDarrell Brogdon is a web developer for SourceForge at VA Linux Systems and has been using PHP since 1996.\nRead more PHP Admin Basics columns.\nDiscuss this article in the O'Reilly Network PHP Forum.\nReturn to the PHP DevCenter.\nCopyright \u00a9 2009 O'Reilly Media, Inc.","id":"<urn:uuid:26746c26-10ba-46d1-9738-1e79ec76d82b>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.oreillynet.com\/lpt\/a\/509","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9334549308,"token_count":1155,"score":2.609375,"int_score":3}

It killed the ancient Romans--and now it's killing me\"\nclassical Latin (n.)\nLatin inscription in the Colosseum\n|Spoken in||Roman republic, Roman empire|\n|Region||mare nostrum (Mediterranean)|\n|Era||75 BC to the 3rd century AD, when it developed into Late Latin|\n|Writing system||Latin alphabet|\n|Official language in||Roman republic, Roman empire|\n|Regulated by||Schools of grammar and rhetoric|\nThe range of Latin, 60 AD\nClassical Latin in simplest terms is the socio-linguistic register of the Latin language regarded by the enfranchised and empowered populations of the late Roman republic and the Roman empire as good Latin. Most writers during this time made use of it. Any unabridged Latin dictionary informs moderns that Marcus Tullius Cicero and his contemporaries of the late republic while using lingua Latina and sermo Latinus to mean the Latin language as opposed to the Greek or other languages, and sermo vulgaris or sermo vulgi to refer to the vernacular of the uneducated masses, regarded the speech they valued most and in which they wrote as Latinitas, \"Latinity\", with the implication of good. Sometimes it is called sermo familiaris, \"speech of the good families\", sermo urbanus, \"speech of the city\" or rarely sermo nobilis, \"noble speech\", but mainly besides Latinitas it was Latine (adverb), \"in good Latin\", or Latinius (comparative degree of adjective), \"good Latin.\"\nLatinitas was spoken as well as written. Moreover, it was the language taught by the schools. Prescriptive rules therefore applied to it, and where a special subject was concerned, such as poetry or rhetoric, additional rules applied as well. Now that the spoken Latinitas has become extinct (in favor of various other registers later in date) the rules of the, for the most part, polished (politus) texts may give the appearance of an artificial language, but Latinitas was a form of sermo, or spoken language and as such retains a spontaneity. No authors are noted for the type of rigidity evidenced by stylized art, except possibly the repetitious abbreviations and stock phrases of inscriptions.\nGood Latin in philology is \"classical\" Latin literature. The term refers to the canonicity of works of literature written in Latin in the late Roman republic and the early to middle Roman empire: \"that is to say, that of belonging to an exclusive group of authors (or works) that were considered to be emblematic of a certain genre.\" The term classicus (masculine plural classici) was devised by the Romans themselves to translate Greek \u1f10\u03b3\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 (egkrithentes), \"select\", referring to authors who wrote in Greek that were considered model. Before then, classis, in addition to being a naval fleet, was a social class in one of the diachronic divisions of Roman society according to property ownership by the Roman constitution. The word is a transliteration of Greek \u03ba\u03bb\u1fc6\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 (kl\u0113sis) \"calling\", used to rank army draftees by property from first to fifth class.\nClassicus is anything primae classis, \"first class\", such as the authors of the polished works of Latinitas, or sermo urbanus. It had nuances of the certified and the authentic: testis classicus, \"reliable witness.\" It was in this sense that Marcus Cornelius Fronto (an African-Roman lawyer and language teacher) in the 2nd century AD used scriptores classici, \"first-class\" or \"reliable authors\" whose works could be relied upon as model of good Latin. This is the first known reference, possibly innovated at this time, to classical applied to authors by virtue of the authentic language of their works.\nIn imitation of the Greek grammarians, the Roman ones, such as Quintilian, drew up lists termed indices or ordines on the model of the Greek lists, termed pinakes, considered classical: the recepti scriptores, \"select writers.\" Aulus Gellius includes many authors, such as Plautus, who are currently considered writers of Old Latin and not strictly in the period of classical Latin. The classical Romans distinguished Old Latin as prisca Latinitas and not sermo vulgaris. Each author (and work) in the Roman lists was considered equivalent to one in the Greek; for example Ennius was the Latin Homer, the Aeneid was a new Iliad, and so on. The lists of classical authors were as far as the Roman grammarians went in developing a philology. The topic remained at that point while interest in the classici scriptores declined in the medieval period as the best Latin yielded to medieval Latin, somewhat less than the best by classical standards.\nThe Renaissance brought a revival of interest in restoring as much of Roman culture as could be restored and with it the return of the concept of classic, \"the best.\" Thomas Sebillet in 1548 (Art Po\u00e9tique) referred to \"les bons et classiques po\u00e8tes fran\u00e7ois\", meaning Jean de Meun and Alain Chartier, which was the first modern application of the word. According to Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, the term classical, from classicus, entered modern English in 1599, some 50 years after its re-introduction on the continent. Governor William Bradford in 1648 referred to synods of a separatist church as \"classical meetings\" in his Dialogue, a report of a meeting between New-England-born \"young men\" and \"ancient men\" from Holland and England. In 1715 Laurence Echard's Classical Geographical Dictionary was published. In 1736 Robert Ainsworth's Thesaurus Linguae Latinae Compendarius turned English words and expressions into \"proper and classical Latin.\" In 1768 David Ruhnken (Critical History of the Greek Orators) recast the mold of the view of the classical by applying the word canon to the pinakes of orators, after the Biblical canon or list of authentic books of the Bible. Ruhnken had a kind of secular catechism in mind.\nIn 1870 Wilhelm Sigismund Teuffel in Geschichte der R\u00f6mischen Literatur (A History of Roman Literature) innovated the definitive philological classification of classical Latin based on the metaphoric uses of the ancient myth of the Ages of Man, a practice then universally current: a Golden Age and a Silver Age of classical Latin were to be presumed. The practice and Teuffel's classification, with modifications, are still in use. His work was translated into English as soon as published in German by Wilhelm Wagner, who corresponded with Teuffel. Wagner published the English translation in 1873. Teuffel divides the chronology of classical Latin authors into several periods according to political events, rather than by style. Regarding the style of the literary Latin of those periods he had but few comments.\nTeuffel was to go on with other editions of his history, but meanwhile it had come out in English almost as soon as it did in German and found immediate favorable reception. In 1877 Charles Thomas Cruttwell produced the first English work along the same lines. In his Preface he refers to \"Teuffel's admirable history, without which many chapters in the present work could not have attained completeness\" and also gives credit to Wagner.\nCruttwell adopts the same periods with minor differences; however, where Teuffel's work is mainly historical, Cruttwell's work contains detailed analyses of style. Nevertheless like Teuffel he encounters the same problem of trying to summarize the voluminous detail in a way that captures in brief the gist of a few phases of writing styles. Like Teuffel, he has trouble finding a name for the first of the three periods (the current Old Latin phase), calling it mainly \"from Livius to Sulla.\" The language, he says, is \"\u2026marked by immaturity of art and language, by a vigorous but ill-disciplined imitation of Greek poetical models, and in prose by a dry sententiousness of style, gradually giving way to a clear and fluent strength\u2026\" These abstracts have little meaning to those not well-versed in Latin literature. In fact, Cruttwell admits \"The ancients, indeed, saw a difference between Ennius, Pacuvius, and Accius, but it may be questioned whether the advance would be perceptible by us.\"\nSome of Cruttwell's ideas have become stock in Latin philology for better or for worse. While praising the application of rules to classical Latin, most intensely in the Golden Age, he says \"In gaining accuracy, however, classical Latin suffered a grievous loss. It became cultivated as distinct from a natural language\u2026 Spontaneity, therefore, became impossible and soon invention also ceased\u2026 In a certain sense, therefore, Latin was studied as a dead language, while it was still a living.\" These views are certainly debatable; one might ask how the upper classes of late 16th century Britain, who shared the Renaissance zealousness for the classics, managed to speak spontaneous Latin to each other officially and unofficially after being taught classical Latin by tutors hired for the purpose. Latinitas in the Golden Age was in fact sermo familiaris, the spoken Latin of the Roman upper classes, who sent their children to school to learn it. The debate continues.\nA second problem is the appropriateness of Teuffel's scheme to the concept of classical Latin, which Teuffel does not discuss. Cruttwell addresses the problem, however, altering the concept of the classical. As the best Latin is defined as golden Latin, the second of the three periods, the other two periods considered classical are left hanging. While on the one hand assigning to Old Latin the term pre-classical and by implication the term post-classical (or post-Augustan) to silver Latin Cruttwell realizes that this construct is not according to ancient usage and asserts \"\u2026the epithet classical is by many restricted to the authors who wrote in it [golden Latin]. It is best, however, not to narrow unnecessarily the sphere of classicity; to exclude Terence on the one hand or Tacitus and Pliny on the other, would savour of artificial restriction rather than that of a natural classification.\" (This from a scholar who had just been complaining that golden Latin was not a natural language.) The contradiction remains; Terence is and is not a classical author depending on context.\nAfter defining a \"First Period\" of inscriptional Latin and the literature of the earliest known authors and fragments, to which he assigns no definitive name (he does use the term \"Old Roman\" at one point), Teuffel presents \"the second period\", his major, \"das goldene Zeitalter der r\u00f6mischen Literatur\", the Golden Age of Roman Literature, dated 671 \u2013 767 AUC or 83 BC \u2013 14 AD according to his time reckoning, between the dictatorship of Lucius Cornelius Sulla and the death of the emperor Augustus. Of it Wagner translating Teuffel writes\nThe golden age of the Roman literature is that period in which the climax was reached in the perfection of form, and in most respects also in the methodical treatment of the subject-matters. It may be subdivided between the generations, in the first of which (the Ciceronian Age) prose culminated, while poetry was principally developed in the Augustan Age.\nThe Ciceronian Age was dated 671\u2013711 AUC (83 BC \u2013 43 BC), ending just after the assassination of Gaius Julius Caesar, and the Augustan 711\u201367 AUC (43 BC \u2013 14 AD), ending with the death of Augustus. The Ciceronian Age is further divided by the consulship of Cicero in 691 AUC or 63 BC into a first and second half. Authors are assigned to these periods by years of principal achievements.\nThe Golden Age had already made an appearance in German philology but in a less systematic way. In Bielfeld's 1770 Elements of universal erudition the author says (in translation): \"The Second Age of Latin began about the time of Caesar [his ages are different from Teuffel's], and ended with Tiberius. This is what is called the Augustan Age, which was perhaps of all others the most brilliant, a period at which it should seem as if the greatest men, and the immortal authors, had met together upon the earth, in order to write the Latin language in its utmost purity and perfection.\" and of Tacitus \"\u2026his conceits and sententious style is not that of the golden age\u2026\". Teuffel evidently received the ideas of a golden and silver Latin from an existing tradition and embedded them in a new system, transforming them as he thought best.\nIn Cruttwell's introduction, the Golden Age is dated 80 BC \u2013 14 AD (\"from Cicero to Ovid\"), which is about the same as Teuffel's. Of this \"Second Period\" Cruttwell says that it \"represents the highest excellence in prose and poetry,\" paraphrasing Teuffel. The Ciceronian Age is now \"the Republican Period\" and is dated 80\u201342 BC through the Battle of Philippi. Later in the book Cruttwell omits Teuffel's first half of the Ciceronian and starts the Golden Age at Cicero's consulship of 63 BC, an error perpetuated into Cruttwell's second edition as well. He must mean 80 BC as he includes Varro in Golden Latin. Teuffel's Augustan Age is Cruttwell's Augustan Epoch, 42 BC \u2013 14 AD.\nThe literary histories list all authors canonical to the Ciceronian Age even though their works may be fragmentary or may not have survived at all. With the exception of a few major writers, such as Cicero, Caesar, Lucretius and Catullus, ancient accounts of Republican literature are glowing accounts of jurists and orators who wrote prolifically but who now can't be read because their works have been lost, or analyses of language and style that appear insightful but can't be verified because there are no surviving instances. In that sense the pages of literary history are peopled with shadows: Aquilius Gallus, Quintus Hortensius Hortalus, Lucius Licinius Lucullus and many others who left a reputation but no readable works; they are to be presumed in the Golden Age by their associations. A list of some canonical authors of the period, whose works have survived in whole or in part (typically in part, some only short fragments) is as follows:\nThe Golden Age is divided by the assassination of Julius Caesar. In the wars that followed the Republican generation of literary men was lost, as most of them had taken the losing side; Marcus Tullius Cicero was beheaded in the street as he enquired from his litter what the disturbance was. They were replaced by a new generation that had grown up and been educated under the old and were now to make their mark under the watchful eye of the new emperor. As the demand for great orators was more or less over, the talent shifted emphasis to poetry. Other than the historian Livy, the most remarkable writers of the period were the poets Vergil, Horace, and Ovid. Although Augustus evidenced some toleration to republican sympathizers, he exiled Ovid, and imperial tolerance ended with the continuance of the Julio-Claudian Dynasty.\nAugustan writers include:\nIn his second volume, on the Imperial Period, Teuffel initiated a slight alteration in approach, making it clearer that his terms applied to the Latin and not just to the age, and also changing his dating scheme from years AUC to modern. Although he introduces das silberne Zeitalter der r\u00f6mischen Literatur, \"the Silver Age of Roman Literature\", 14\u2013117 AD, from the death of Augustus to the death of Trajan, he also mentions regarding a section of a work by Seneca the Elder a wenig Einfluss der silbernen Latinit\u00e4t, a \"slight influence of silver Latin.\" It is clear that he had shifted in thought from golden and silver ages to golden and silver Latin, and not just Latin, but Latinitas, which must at this point be interpreted as classical Latin. He may have been influenced in that regard by one of his sources, E. Opitz, who in 1852 had published a title specimen lexilogiae argenteae latinitatis, mentioning silver Latinity. Although Teuffel's First Period was equivalent to Old Latin and his Second Period was equal to the Golden Age, his Third Period, die r\u00f6mische Kaiserheit, encompasses both the Silver Age and the centuries now termed Late Latin, in which the forms seemed to break loose from their foundation and float freely; that is, literary men appeared uncertain as to what \"good Latin\" should mean. The last of the Classical Latin is the Silver Latin. The Silver Age is the first of the Imperial Period and is divided into die Zeit der julischen Dynastie, 14\u201368; die Zeit der flavischen Dynastie, 69\u201396; and die Zeit des Nerva und Trajan, 96\u2013117. Subsequently Teuffel goes over to a century scheme: 2nd, 3rd, etc., through 6th. His later editions (which came out in the rest of the late 19th century) divide the Imperial Age into parts: the 1st century (Silver Age), the 2nd century: Hadrian and the Antonines and the 3rd through the 6th Centuries. Of the Silver Age proper, pointing out that anything like freedom of speech had vanished with Tiberius, Teuffel says\n\u2026the continual apprehension in which men lived caused a restless versatility\u2026 Simple or natural composition was considered insipid; the aim of language was to be brilliant\u2026 Hence it was dressed up with abundant tinsel of epigrams, rhetorical figures and poetical terms\u2026 Mannerism supplanted style, and bombastic pathos took the place of quiet power.\nThe content of new literary works was continually proscribed by the emperor (by executing or exiling the author), who also played the role of literary man (typically badly). The talent therefore went into a repertory of new and dazzling mannerisms, which Teuffel calls \"utter unreality.\" Crutwell picks up this theme:\nThe foremost of these [characteristics] is unreality, arising from the extinction of freedom\u2026 Hence arose a declamatory tone, which strove by frigid and almost hyterical exaggeration to make up for the healthy stimulus afforded by daily contact with affairs. The vein of artificial rhetoric, antithesis and epigram\u2026 owes its origin to this forced contentment with an uncongenial sphere. With the decay of freedom, taste sank\u2026\nIn Crutwell's view (which had not been expressed by Teuffel), Silver Latin was a \"rank, weed-grown garden\", a \"decline.\" Cruttwell had already decried what he saw as a loss of spontaneity in Golden Latin. That Teuffel should regard the Silver Age as a loss of natural language and therefore of spontaneity, implying that the Golden Age had it, is passed without comment. Instead, Tiberius brought about a \"sudden collapse of letters.\" The idea of a decline had been dominant in English society since Edward Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Once again, Cruttwell evidences some unease with his stock pronouncements: \"The Natural History of Pliny shows how much remained to be done in fields of great interest.\" The idea of Pliny as a model is not consistent with any sort of decline; moreover, Pliny did his best work under emperors at least as tolerant as Augustus had been. To include some of the best writings of the Silver Age, Cruttwell found he had to extend the period through the death of Marcus Aurelius, 180 AD. The philosophic prose of that good emperor was in no way compatible with either Teuffel's view of unnatural language or Cruttwell's depiction of a decline. Having created these constructs, the two philologists found they could not entirely justify them; apparently, in the worst implications of their views, there was no classical Latin by the ancient definition at all and some of the very best writing of any period in world history was a stilted and degenerate unnatural language.\nWriters of the Silver Age include the following.\nOf the additional century granted by Cruttwell and others of his point of view to Silver Latin but not by Teuffel the latter says \"The second century was a happy period for the Roman State, the happiest indeed during the whole Empire\u2026 But in the world of letters the lassitude and enervation, which told of Rome's decline, became unmistakeable\u2026 its forte is in imitation.\" Teuffel, however, excepts the jurists; others find other \"exceptions,\" recasting Teuffels's view.\nThe style of language refers to repeatable features of speech that are somewhat less general than the fundamental characteristics of the language. The latter give it a unity allowing it to be referenced under a single name. Thus Old Latin, Classical Latin, Vulgar Latin, etc., are not considered different languages, but are all referenced under the name of Latin. This is an ancient practice continued by moderns rather than a philological innovation of recent times. That Latin had case endings is a fundamental feature of the language. Whether a given form of speech prefers to use prepositions such as ad, ex, de for \"to\", \"from\" and \"of\" rather than simple case endings is a matter of style. Latin has a large number of styles. Each and every author has a style, which typically allows his prose or poetry to be identified by experienced Latinists. The problem of comparative literature has been to group styles finding similarities by period, in which case one may speak of Old Latin, Silver Latin, Late Latin as styles or a phase of styles.\nThe ancient authors themselves first defined style by recognizing different kinds of sermo, or \"speech.\" In making the value judgement that classical Latin was \"first class\" and that it was better to write with Latinitas they were themselves selecting the literary and upper-class language of the city as a standard style and all sermo that differed from it was a different style; thus in rhetoric Cicero was able to define sublime, intermediate and low styles (within classical Latin) and St. Augustine to recommend the low style for sermons (from sermo). Style therefore is to be defined by differences in speech from a standard. Teuffel defined that standard as Golden Latin.","id":"<urn:uuid:ca387b2a-7df2-4bb1-8e2d-9e82dcdc8b5a>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/dictionary.sensagent.com\/Classical_Latin\/en-en\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9565777779,"token_count":5107,"score":2.859375,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Multistate Outbreak of Human Salmonella Chester Infections (Final Update)\nPosted September 9, 2010\nThis outbreak appears to be over. However, Salmonella is an important cause of human illness in the United States. More information about Salmonella, and steps people can take to reduce their risk of infection, can be found on the CDC Salmonella Web Page.\nPersons Infected with the Outbreak Strain of Salmonella Chester, United States, by State\nInfections with the Outbreak Strain of Salmonella Chester, by Week of Illness Onset\nCDC collaborated with public health officials in many states, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA\/FSIS), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to investigate a multistate outbreak of Salmonella serotype Chester infections. Investigators used DNA analysis of Salmonella bacteria obtained through diagnostic testing to identify cases of illness that were part of this outbreak.\nAs of 9:00 AM EDT on August 27, 2010, a total of 44 individuals infected with a matching strain of Salmonella Chester have been reported from 18 states since April 11, 2010. The number of ill people identified in each state with this strain is as follows: AK (1), CA (5), CO (2), GA (8), IL (1), KY (1), MA (2), MN (2), MO (1), NC (1), OK (1), OR (2), SC (2), TN (1), TX (3), UT (3), VA (4), and WA (4). Among those for whom information is available about when symptoms started, illnesses began between April 4, 2010 and June 16, 2010. Case-patients ranged in age from <1 to 88 years old, and the median age was 36 years. Fifty-four percent of patients were female. Among the 43 patients with available hospitalization information, 16 (37%) were hospitalized. No deaths were reported.\nThe outbreak can be visually described with a chart showing the number of people who became ill each day. This chart is called an epidemic curve or epi curve. For more details, please see the Salmonella Outbreak Investigations: Timeline for Reporting Cases.\nInvestigation of the Outbreak\nA widely distributed contaminated food product might cause illnesses across the United States. The identity of the contaminated product often is not readily apparent. In outbreaks like this one, identification of the contaminated product requires conducting detailed standardized interviews with persons who were ill. It may also require conducting interviews with non-ill members of the public (\"controls\") to get information about foods recently eaten and other exposures to compare with information from the ill persons. The investigation is often supplemented by laboratory testing of suspected products.\nCollaborative investigative efforts of officials in many local, state, and federal public health, agriculture, and regulatory agencies linked this outbreak to Marie Callender\u2019s Cheesy Chicken & Rice single-serve frozen entr\u00e9es. During June 14-18, 2010, CDC and public health officials in multiple states conducted an epidemiologic study by comparing foods eaten by 19 ill and 22 well persons. Analysis of this study suggested that eating a Marie Callender's frozen meal was a source of illness. Ill persons (89%) were significantly more likely than well persons (14%) to report eating a frozen meal. All ill persons (100%) who ate frozen meals reported eating a Marie Callender's frozen meal. None of the well persons who ate a frozen meal reported eating a Marie Callender's frozen meal. There was insufficient data from this study to implicate a specific frozen meal type. However, many of the ill persons reported eating a Marie Callender's Cheesy Chicken & Rice frozen entr\u00e9e in the week before becoming ill. Additionally, two unopened packages of Marie Callender\u2019s Cheesy Chicken & Rice single-serve frozen entr\u00e9es collected from two patients\u2019 homes (one collected in Minnesota on June 18, and one in Tennessee on July 19) yielded Salmonella Chester isolates with a genetic fingerprint indistinguishable from the outbreak pattern.\nOn June 17, 2010, ConAgra Foods announced a precautionary recall of Marie Callender's Cheesy Chicken & Rice single-serve frozen entr\u00e9es after being informed by the CDC of a possible association between this product and the outbreak of Salmonella Chester infections.\nOn June 17, 2010, USDA's FSIS announced ConAgra's recall.\nView recalled food package [PDF - 6 pages] posted by FSIS.\nClinical Features\/Signs and Symptoms\nMost people infected with Salmonella develop diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps 12\u201372 hours after infection. Infection is usually diagnosed by culture of a stool sample. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Although most people recover without treatment, severe infections can occur. Infants, elderly people, and those with weakened immune systems are more likely than others to develop severe illness. When severe infection occurs, Salmonella may spread from the intestines to the bloodstream and then to other body sites and can cause death unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics.\nMore general information about Salmonella can be found here under Salmonella FAQs.\nAdvice to Consumers\n- Salmonella is sometimes present in raw foods (e.g., chicken, produce, and spices) which can be used as ingredients in not-ready-to-eat frozen dinners.\n- Consumers should follow the instructions on the package label of the frozen dinner. Conventional ovens are better at cooking foods thoroughly. Microwave ovens vary in strength and tend to cook foods unevenly.\n- If you choose to cook the frozen dinner using a microwave, be sure to:\n- Cook the food for the time specified for your microwave's wattage.\n- Let the food \"stand\" for the stated time, so cooking can continue.\n- Use a food thermometer to make sure that it is fully cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit.\n- Individuals who think they might have become ill from eating a Marie Callender's frozen dinner should consult their health care providers.\n- Consumers who have Marie Callender's Cheesy Chicken & Rice single-serve frozen entr\u00e9es in their freezer should discard them or return them to their retailer for a refund.\n- Consumers are urged to read and follow the preparation instructions on the label of all frozen entrees. If the package says \u201cDo Not Microwave,\u201d consumers should follow that instruction and use a conventional oven. Consumers should use a food thermometer to make sure the entrees reach at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit.\n- General Information: Salmonella\n- Description of the Steps In a Foodborne Outbreak Investigation\n- CDC's Role During a Multi-State Foodborne Outbreak Investigation\n- Two Minnesota cases of Salmonella infection linked to national recall of frozen meals\n- Cooking Safely in the Microwave Oven\nCDC's Role in Food Safety\nAs an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), CDC leads federal efforts to gather data on foodborne illnesses, investigate foodborne illnesses and outbreaks, and monitor the effectiveness of prevention and control efforts. CDC is not a food safety regulatory agency but works closely with the food safety regulatory agencies, in particular with HHS's U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Food Safety and Inspection Service within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). CDC also plays a key role in building state and local health department epidemiology, laboratory, and environmental health capacity to support foodborne disease surveillance and outbreak response. Notably, CDC data can be used to help document the effectiveness of regulatory interventions.","id":"<urn:uuid:e80979e4-dc90-433e-87c7-2ff9f0083129>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/salmonella\/chester\/index.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9372903109,"token_count":1598,"score":2.65625,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Teaching Strategies: Effective Discussion Leading\nWhile lecturing is a fast and direct way to communicate a body of knowledge, discussion encourages students to discover solutions for themselves and to develop their critical thinking abilities. They learn how to generate ideas, consider relevant issues, evaluate solutions, and consider the implications of these solutions. Thus, although discussion is not as efficient as lecture in conveying facts, it helps students learn how to think better and more clearly about the facts that they should learn from their reading and their lectures.\nLeading a discussion, however, offers its own set of challenges: participants can spend too much time exploring small, sometimes irrelevant issues, forget that they are progressing toward an identifiable goal, and become bored. The leader must guide the conversation carefully without stifling creativity and students' initiative and without surrendering to some students' desire for answers that they can write down and memorize.\nHere are four strategies that can help faculty and TAs encourage students explore issues themselves:\nWe all know that creating a fine lecture requires research and planning; we sometimes forget that leading a good discussion requires the same research and planning and demands spontaneous responses in the classroom. The beauty of the extra demand is that developing the skills for intervening and directing discussions leads to exciting, productive exchanges that help students learn to think clearly and creatively, while simultaneously inspiring you to teach more thoroughly and carefully.\n\"Discussions: Leading and Guiding, but Not Controlling,\" The\nTeaching Professor VI, 8 [October 1992].)","id":"<urn:uuid:03dc16ec-33ae-4c39-a06b-93924571a72e>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/trc.virginia.edu\/Publications\/Teaching_Concerns\/Fall_1993\/TC_Fall_1993_Teaching_Strategies.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9542757273,"token_count":304,"score":4.03125,"int_score":4}
{"text":"|Regions with significant populations|\n|New York, Massachusetts, Michigan, Louisiana, Ohio, Iowa, Texas|\n|Related ethnic groups|\nSyrian Americans are residents of the United States of Syrian ancestry or nationality. This group includes Americans of Syrian ancestry, Syrian first generation immigrants, or descendants of Syrians who emigrated to the United States. Syrian Americans may be members of a number of differing ethnicities, including Arabs, Assyrians\/Syriacs, Antiochian Greeks, Kurds, Armenians and Circassians. It is believed that the first significant wave of Syrian immigrants to arrive in the United States was in 1880. Many of the earliest Syrian Americans settled in New York, Boston, and Detroit. Immigration from Syria to the United States suffered a long hiatus after the United States Congress passed the Immigration Act of 1924, which restricted immigration. More than 40 years later, the Immigration Act of 1965, abolished the quotas and immigration from Syria to the United States saw a surge. An estimated 64,600 Syrians emigrated to the United States between 1961 and 2000.\nThe overwhelming majority of Syrian immigrants to the US from 1880 to 1960 were Christian, a minority were Jewish, whereas Muslim Syrians arrived in the United States chiefly after 1965. According to the United States 2000 Census, there were 142,897 Americans of Syrian ancestry, about 12% of the Arab population in the United States.\nThe first Syrian immigrants arrived in the United States from Ottoman Syria. Most of them came from Christian villages around Mount Lebanon, while around 5-10% were Muslims of different sects. A small number were also Palestinians. According to historian Philip Hitti, approximately 90,000 \"Syrians\" arrived in the United States between 1899 and 1919. An estimated 1,000 official entries per year came from the governorates of Damascus and Aleppo, which are governorates in modern-day Syria, in the period between 1900 and 1916. Early immigrants settled mainly in Eastern United States, in the cities of New York, Boston and Detroit and the Paterson, New Jersey area. In the 1920s, the majority of immigrants from Mount Lebanon began to refer themselves as \"Lebanese\" instead of \"Syrians\".\nSyrians, like most immigrants to the United States, were motivated to immigrate to the United States to pursue the American Dream of economic success. Many Christian Syrians had immigrated to the United States seeking religious freedom and an escape from Ottoman hegemony. Thousands of immigrants returned to Syria after making money in the United States; these immigrants told tales which inspired further waves of immigrants. Many settlers also sent for their relatives.\nAlthough the number of Syrian immigrants was not sizable, the Ottoman government set constraints on emigration in order to maintain its populace in Greater Syria. The United States Congress passed the Immigration Act of 1924, which greatly reduced Syrian immigration to the United States. However, the quotas were annulled by the Immigration Act of 1965, which opened the doors again to Syrian immigrants. 4,600 Syrians immigrated to the United States in the mid-1960s. Due to the Arab-Israeli and religious conflicts in Syria during this period, many Syrians immigrated to the United States seeking a democratic haven, where they could live in freedom without political suppression. An estimated 64,600 Syrians immigrated to the United States in the period between 1961 and 2000, of which ten percent have been admitted under the refugee acts.\nAccording to the United States 2000 Census, there are 142,897 Americans of Syrian ancestry living in the United States. New York City has the biggest concentration of Syrian Americans in the United States. Other urban areas, including Boston, Dearborn, New Orleans, Toledo, Cedar Rapids, and Houston have large Syrian populations. Syrian Americans are also numerous in Southern California (i.e. the Los Angeles and San Diego areas) and Arizona, many are descendants of farm laborers invited with their farm skills to irrigate the deserts in the early 20th century.. Many recent Syrian immigrants are medical doctors who studied at Damascus and Aleppo Universities and pursued their residencies and fellowships in the United States.\nThe traditional clothing of the first Syrian immigrants in the United States, along with their occupation as peddlers, led to some xenophobia. Dr. A. J. McLaughlin, the United States health officer at Marine Hospital, described Syrians as \"parasites in their peddling habits.\" However, Syrians reacted quickly to assimilate fully into their new culture. Immigrants Anglicized their names, adopted the English language and common Christian denominations. Syrians did not congregate in urban enclaves; many of the immigrants who had worked as peddlers were able to interact with Americans on a daily basis. This helped them to absorb and learn the language and customs of their new homeland. Additionally, military service during World War I and World War II helped accelerate assimilation. Assimilation of early Syrian immigrants was so successful that it has become difficult to recognize the ancestors of many families which have become completely Americanized.\nPost 1965 Immigration was mostly Muslim, and unlike their Christian counterparts they faced a somewhat greater difficulty in assimilating because of their Islamic faith and the \"back to the roots\" trend that gripped America in the 1960s and 1970s. Generally, they are not overly desirous of giving up their identity as Arabs, which might be a result of the bloom in multiculturalism to respect their Islamic religious customs and traditions in the United States.\nChristian Syrian Americans arrived in the United States in the late 19th century. Most Christian Syrian Americans are Greek Orthodox. There are also many Catholic Syrian Americans; most branches of Catholicism are of the Eastern rite, such as Maronite Catholics, Melkite Greek Catholics, Armenian Catholics, Syrian Catholics, and Assyrian Chaldean Catholics. There are only few minor differences between the different branches of Catholicism; such differences include the language\/s church services are conducted, and the belief in papal infallibility. A few Christian Syrian Americans are Protestant. There are also members of the Assyrian Church of the East and Ancient Church of the East. The first Syrian American church was founded in Brooklyn, New York in 1895 by Saint Raphael of Brooklyn. There are currently hundreds of Eastern Orthodox churches and missions in the United States. Saint Nicholas and Saint George are popular saints for the Orthodox.\nMuslim Syrian Americans arrived chiefly after 1965. The largest sect in Islam is the Sunni sect, forming 74% of the Muslim Syrian population. The second largest sect in Islam in Syria is the Alawite sect, a religious sect that originated in Shia Islam but separated from other Shiite Islam groups in the ninth and tenth centuries. Most, if not all, Alawi Syrians come from the rural areas of Latakia Governorate. Muslim Syrian Americans have often found it difficult practicing their religion in the United States; For example, some Muslims, who are required to pray five times a day as part of Muslim rite, argue that there aren't enough mosques in the United States.\nDruzes form the third largest sect in Syria, which is a relatively small esoteric monotheistic religious sect. Early Syrian immigrants included Druze peddlers. Muslim Syrian Americans have often found it difficult practicing their religion in the United States;\nSyrian Jews first immigrated to the United States around 1908 and settled mostly in New York. Initially they lived on the Lower East Side; later settlements were in Bensonhurst and Ocean Parkway in Flatbush, Brooklyn. The Syrian Jewish community estimates its population at around 50,000.\nEarly Syrian Americans were not involved politically. Business owners were usually Republican, meanwhile labor workers were usually Democrats. Second generation Syrian Americans were the first to be elected for political roles. In light of the Arab-Israeli conflict, many Syrian Americans tried to affect American foreign policy by joining Arab political groups in the United States. In the early 1970s, the National Association of Arab-Americans was formed to negate the stereotypes commonly associated with Arabs in American media. Syrian Americans were also part of the Arab American Institute, established in 1985, which supports and promotes Arab American candidates, or candidates commiserative with Arabs and Arab Americans, for office. Mitch Daniels, the current Governor of Indiana, is a descendant of Syrian immigrants with relatives in Homs.\nThe majority of the early Syrian immigrants arrived in the United States seeking better jobs; they usually engaged in basic commerce, especially peddling. Syrian American peddlers found their jobs comfortable since peddling required little training and mediocre vocabulary. Syrian American peddlers served as the distribution medium for the products of small manufacturers. Syrian peddlers traded mostly in dry goods, primarily clothing. Networks of Syrian traders and peddlers across the United States aided the distribution of Syrian settlements; by 1902, Syrians could be found working in Seattle, Washington. Most of these peddlers were successful, and, with time, and after raising enough capital, some became importers and wholesalers, recruiting newcomers and supplying them with merchandise. By 1908, there were 3,000 Syrian-owned businesses in the United States. By 1910, the first Syrian millionaires had emerged.\nSyrian Americans gradually started to work in various m\u00e9tiers; many worked as physicians, lawyers, and engineers. Many Syrian Americans also worked in the bustling auto industry, bringing about large Syrian American gatherings in areas like Dearborn, Michigan. Later Syrian emigrants served in fields like banking, medicine, and computer science. Syrian Americans have a different occupational distribution than all Americans. According to the 2000 census, 42% of the Syrian Americans worked in management and professional occupations, compared with 34% of their counterparts in the total population; additionally, more Syrian Americans worked in sales than all American workers. However, Syrian Americans worked less in the other work domains like farming, transportation, construction, etc. than all American workers. According to the American Medical Association (AMA) and the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS) which represents the American health care provoiders of Syrian descent www.sams-usa.net there are estimated 4000 Syrian physicians practicing in the United States representing 0.4% of the health workforce and 1.6% of international medical graduates. However the reported number of Syrian American phyicians does not include the second and third generation of Syrian descent, therefore it is estimated that there are 10,000 Syrian American physicians practice in the United States. Arabi M, Sankri-Tarbichi AG. The metrics of Syrian physicians' brain drain to the United States. Avicenna J Med [serial online] 2012 [cited 2012 Oct 27];2:1-2. Available from: http:\/\/www.avicennajmed.com\/text.asp?2012\/2\/1\/1\/94802.\nThe median level of earnings for Syrian men and women is higher than the national earning median; employed Syrian men earned an average $46,058 per year, compared with $37,057 for all Americans and $41,687 for Arab Americans. Syrian American families also had a higher median income than all families and lower poverty rates than those of the general population.\nSyrians value strong family ties. Unlike young Americans, young Syrians find leaving their family unnecessary to set up their independence; the reason being, is that Syrian society just like Southwest Asia, North Africa and the wider Eastern world, places great emphasis on the group rather than the individual. In the West the individual is key and the group is secondary. Respect and social status are important in Syrian societies. Men are respected for their financial success or their honesty and sincerity. Syrians are characterized by their magnanimity and graciousness, ethics which are integral to Syrian life.\" However, much of the Syrian traditions have diminished with time, mainly due to the fast pace of life in America which encourages individual independence.\nSyrians consider eating an important aspect of social life. There are many Syrian dishes which have become popular in the United States. Unlike many Western foods, Syrian foods take more time to cook, are less expensive and usually more healthy. Pita bread (khubz), which is round flat bread, and hummus, a dip made of ground chickpeas, sesame tahini, lemon juice, and garlic, are two popular Syrian foods. Baba ghanoush, or eggplant spreads, is also a dish made by Syrians. Popular Syrian salads include tabbouleh and fattoush. The Syrian cuisine includes other dishes like stuffed zucchini (mahshe), dolma, kebab, kibbeh, kibbeh nayyeh, mujaddara, shawarma, and shanklish. Syrians often serve selections of appetizers, known as meze, before the main course. Za'atar, minced beef, and cheese manakish are popular hors d'\u0153uvre. Syrians are also well known for their cheese. A popular Syrian drink is the arak beverage. One of the popular desserts made by Syrians is the baklava, which is made of filo pastry filled with chopped nuts and soaked in honey.\nSyrian music includes several genres and styles of music ranging from Arab classical to Arabic pop music and from secular to sacred music. Syrian music is characterized by an emphasis on melody and rhythm, as opposed to harmony. There are some genres of Syrian music that are polyphonic, but typically, most Syrian and Arabic music is homophonic. Syrian music is also characterized by the predominance of vocal music. The prototypical Arabic music ensemble in Egypt and Syria is known as the takht, and relies on a number of musical instruments that represent a standardized tone system, and are played with generally standardized performance techniques, thus displaying similar details in construction and design. Such musical instruments include the oud, kanun, rabab, ney, violin, riq and tableh. The Jews of Syria sang pizmonim.\nModern Syrian music has incorporated instruments from the West, including the electric guitar, cello, double bass and oboe, and incorporated influences from jazz and other foreign musical styles.\nTraditional clothing \nTraditional dress is not very common with Syrian Americans, and even native Syrians; modern Western clothing is conventional in both Syria and the United States. Ethnic dance performers wear a shirwal, which are loose, baggy pants with an elastic waist. Some Muslim Syrian women wear a hijab, which is a headscarf worn by Muslim women to cover their hair. There are various styles of hijab.\nSyrian Americans celebrate many religious holidays. Christian Syrian Americans celebrate most Christian holidays usually celebrated in the United States. They celebrate Christmas and Easter, but since most Syrians are Eastern Orthodox, they celebrate Easter on a different Sunday than most other Americans. Some Christians celebrate various Saints' days. Syrian American Jews celebrate the Jewish holidays, such as Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Sukkot, Purim, Passover and Shavuot. Few Syrians celebrate Syria's independence day, April 17. As American citizens, many Syrians celebrate American holidays like Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Thanksgiving Day.\nMuslim Syrian Americans celebrate three main Muslim holidays: Ramadan, Eid ul-Fitr (Lesser Bairam), and Eid ul-Adha (Greater Bairam). Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic year, during which Muslims fast from dawn to sunset; Muslims resort to self-discipline to cleanse themselves spiritually. After Ramadan is over, Muslims celebrate Eid ul-Fitr, when Muslims break their fasting and revel exuberantly. Muslims also celebrate Eid ul-Adha (which means The Festival of Sacrifice) 70 days after at the end of the Islamic year, a holiday which is held along with the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, Hajj.\nDating and marriage \nSyrian Americans prefer traditional relationships and disfavor casual dating. Muslims can only date after completing their marriage contact, kitabt al-kitab (Arabic: \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628, which means \"writing the book\"), a period that ranges from a few months to a year or more to get used to living with one another. After this time period, a wedding takes place and fulfills the marriage. Muslims tend to marry other Muslims only. Unable to find other suitable Muslim Syrian Americans, many Muslim Syrian American have married other Muslim Americans.\nSyrian American marriages are usually very strong; this is reflected by the low divorce rates among Syrian Americans, which are below the average rates in the United States. Generally, Syrian American partners tend to have more children than average American partners; Syrian American partners also tend to have children at early stages of their marriages. According to the United States 2000 Census, almost 62% of Syrian American households were married-couple households.\nSyrian Americans, including the earliest immigrants, have always placed a high premium on education. Like many other Americans, Syrian Americans view education as a necessity. Generally, Syrian and other Arab Americans are more highly educated than the average American. In the 2000 census it was reported that the proportion of Syrian Americans to achieve a bachelor's degree or higher is one and a half times that of the total American population. Many Syrian Americans now work as engineers, scientists, pharmacists, and physicians.\nSyrians are mainly Arabic speakers. While some may speak the formal literary Arabic, many Syrians speak Syrian Arabic, a dialect which belongs to the Levantine Arabic family of dialects. There are also sub-dialects in Syrian Arabic; for example, people from Aleppo have a distinct and distinguishable accent, one that differs considerably from that of people from Homs or Al-Hasakah. Syrians can usually comprehend and understand the dialects of most Arabs, especially those who speak any form of Levantine Arabic.\nMany old Syrian American families have lost their linguistic traditions because many parents do not teach their children Arabic. Newer immigrants, however, maintain their language traditions. The 2000 census shows that 79.9% of Syrian Americans speak English \"very well\". Throughout the United States, there are schools which offer Arabic language classes; there are also some Eastern Orthodox churches which hold Arabic services.\nNotable people and contributions \nSometimes some confusion occurs between Greater Syria and the modern Syria when determining the place of origin of the earliest Syrian Americans. However, the following list comprises notable Americans who are originally people of modern Syrian heritage.\n- Paula Abdul (born June 19, 1962), is a television personality, jewelry designer, multi-platinum Grammy-winning singer, and Emmy Award-winning choreographer.

{"text":"Catholic and Protestant reformers in the 16th century occasionally spoke scornfully of Anabaptists as \"new monks,\" referring to Anabaptist insistence on holy living and intense spiritual life (e.g., TA Elsa\u00df 1, 110-13). Anabaptists occasionally accepted the comparison (Klassen, William and Walter Klaassen, eds. and trans. The Writings of Pilgram Marpeck, Classics of the Radical Reformation, vol. 2. Scottdale, PA: Herald Press, 1978: 217) but more frequently rejected it (Klassen & Klaassen: 215-16; Menno, Writings, 369, 401), in part because monks often came from the socially privileged classes. Several scholars have used monastic history as an aid to interpret Anabaptism (Troeltsch, Ritschl, Davis, Snyder, Martin). Many Anabaptists and Mennonites, beginning with the Hutterite chronicle, pointed to quasi-monastic sectarian medieval movements, especially Waldenses, as forerunners of Anabaptism (these theories are promulgated or discussed by Keller, Gratz, Verduin, Durnbaugh). One of the most extensive efforts to relate monasticism and Anabaptism drew on both monastic and quasi-monastic traditions (Davis). Most scholars have carefully limited their interpretations to pointing out \"intellectual parallels\" or general similarities; some have argued for direct continuity and influence.\nThe crucial interpretive question revolves around the nature of monasticism: is it a nonconforming sectarian development critical of the institutional church (Workman) or an intensified institutional core of the ecclesiastical establishment? Or, did monasticism begin as a charismatic, lay, \"sectarian\" movement in the 4th century but become fully integrated into the sacramental, ecclesial, institutional church by the early Middle Ages (Rousseau, Martin)? How central the critical, separatist aspect of early monasticism is to monastic identity is disputed, even by those within the monastic community (Eoin de Bhaldraithe). Particularly significant in this regard is the distinction between contemplative monastic orders (Benedictine, Cistercian, Carthusian) and more lay-oriented, urban mendicant orders and houses of regular canons of the late Middle Ages (Franciscans, Dominicans, Augustinian Friars, Praemonstratensians, Augustinian Canons). The latter orders were associated with the middle class and were visibly and pastorally active; the former were often but not always associated with the nobility and lived in secluded and rural areas. Most Anabaptist links to \"monks\" appear to have been with the mendicants and canons regular. Michael Sattler is the main exception to this generalization.\nMost interpreters agree that Anabaptists rejected the sacramental and institutional \"culture-church\" of the Middle Ages in favor of a voluntary, non-institutionalized, even anti-clerical church of the faithful few, in effect, reducing the church to a devout \"monastic\" core. At issue among scholars is whether the label \"monastic\" should properly be applied to a sectarian, pure church vision such as that held by Anabaptists, since most monks did not believe that the church was made up solely of monastics, rather, they believed that monks and nuns were part, perhaps the most important part, of the church. The qualities and virtues prized by Anabaptists and Mennonites (hospitality, humility, community, Gelassenheit, obedience, repentance, nonresistance, etc.) were also prime monastic virtues, although all medieval Catholics were exhorted to practice these same virtues.\nSignificant parallels to monastic spirituality are found in the Mennonite period of post-Anabaptist history in which Anabaptist first-generation identity was transformed into a sacramental, ecclesial, institutional, cultural (ethnic) faith, even though Mennonites, Amish, and Hutterites avoided the language of sacramental and institutional Christianity (Cronk, Martin). During the 1980s growing Mennonite concern about the role of single adults in the church has not yet taken account of the traditional Christian monastic theology, with its implications for both marriage and singleness. Recent scholarship on monasticism emphasizes the social role of celibate communities, which enhanced the role of marriage while creating a sphere of activity for those remaining unmarried (Brown, Leclercq). Further research is needed in all these areas of Anabaptist and Mennonite history and culture.\nCronk, Sandra. \"Gelassenheit: The Rites of the Redemptive Process in the Old Order Amish and Old Order Mennonite Communities.\" PhD dissertation, U. of Chicago, 1977.

{"text":"- Our Story\n- In Memory\nVaccination and Immunotherapy for Alzheimer\u2019s Disease\nVaccination against amyloid is a promising approach for the development of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) therapeutics. Approximately half of the investigational new therapeutics in human clinical trials for AD are active or passive immunotherapeutics.\nActive vaccination involves the injection of an antigen and relies on the production of antibodies in the vaccinated patient. Four human clinical trials of active vaccination currently are under way. Passive immunization is also a promising strategy that involves the production of antibodies outside of the patient and injection of these antibodies. There are currently 12 clinical trials of passive immunization. You can check for Alzheimer therapeutics in human clinical trials by visiting www.clinicaltrials.gov and searching for key words \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s and immunotherapy.\u201d\nThinking out of the box\nThe development of vaccinations as a strategy for treating or preventing Alzheimer\u2019s is an example of thinking out of the box. Vaccinations commonly are associated with infectious diseases, like influenza, small pox and polio, which appear to have little in common with neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer\u2019s. Moreover, the brain is an immunoprivileged site with little access to antibodies, so it seems unlikely antibodies would be protective in the brain.\nResearchers were pleasantly surprised when Dale Schenk and co-workers at Elan Inc. reported that vaccination of transgenic mouse models of AD against the amyloid A\u00df peptide prevented amyloid deposition in young animals and removed pre-existing amyloid deposits in older animals. Subsequent work showed that immunization against A\u00df prevented or reversed many other pathological features and prevented cognitive dysfunction in transgenic mice and non-human primates. This vaccine (Elan AN1792) was tested in human clinical trials, where it showed similar beneficial effects of removing amyloid deposits and slowing cognitive decline in patients with significant levels of anti-A\u00df antibodies, but the clinical trial was halted because 6 percent of the patients developed meningoencephalitis, an inflammatory side effect.\nSecond-generation vaccines and passive immunization\nTo circumvent the unwanted inflammatory side effects, second-generation active vaccines have been developed and passive immunization strategies have been explored. The second-generation vaccines use small pieces of the amyloid A\u00df sequence to avoid activating the T-cells responsible for meningoencephalitis, while passive immunization bypasses the human immune response by directly supplying antibodies. These newer strategies have shown the same beneficial effects in transgenic mice and passive immunization has shown some promise in a subset of patients in human trials, but they have raised new questions about their effectiveness and potential new side effects. Elan\/Wyeth reported preliminary results from clinical trials of their monoclonal antibody, Bapineuzimab, that demonstrated only a small benefit in a subgroup of patients who lack the apoE4 genotype. They also failed to observe an improved benefit with an increased dose of antibody and reported side effects, like a buildup of fluid in the brain. Results of active vaccination human clinical trials with second-generation vaccines remain to be reported.\nThird-generation vaccines and antibodies: Thinking perpendicular to the box\nBoth second-generation vaccines and antibodies suffer from a common problem. They both target linear amino acid sequences found in normal human proteins (the amyloid precursor protein) and in the amyloid deposits themselves. Making antibodies against normal human proteins can cause autoimmune side effects, in which the immune system is attacking normal human cells in addition to the Alzheimer\u2019s pathology. Fortunately, it is difficult to make antibodies against self-proteins because of immune suppression of auto antibodies. Third-generation vaccines seek to overcome these problems of autoimmune side effects and autoimmune suppression by using antibodies that target structures specific to the amyloid aggregates and that do not react with normal human proteins.\nCure Alzheimer\u2019s Fund has been supporting two projects that seek to develop third-generation immunotherapeutics. Dr. Charles Glabe\u2019s laboratory is developing active vaccines and monoclonal antibodies that recognize conformations of the amyloid peptide that only occur in the pathological amyloid oligomer aggregates, while Dr. Rob Moir\u2019s lab is working on cross-linked amyloid peptides (CAPs) that are only found in disease-related aggregates. Dr. Glabe\u2019s strategy relies on the fact that when the A\u00df peptide aggregates into \u00df-sheet oligomers, it creates new antibody recognition sites, known as epitopes, that are not found on native proteins. The surprising finding is that these oligomer-specific antibodies recognize amyloid oligomers from other diseases that involve amyloids formed from sequences unrelated to A\u00df. This means the same antibodies also may be effective for other amyloid-related neurodegenerative diseases, like Parkinson\u2019s disease.\nThe explanation for why the antibodies are specific for amyloid oligomers that involve several individual peptide strands arranged in a sheet and yet recognize these sheets when they are formed from other amino acid sequences is simple and elegant (Figure 1). It is now known that most pathological amyloids aggregate into simple and very regular structures where the peptide strands are arranged in parallel and where the amino acid sequence is in exact register. This is like a sheet of paper upon which the same sentence is written on each line. The individual amino acids line up and down the sheet in homogeneous tracts, known as \u201csteric zippers.\u201d The steric zippers do not occur in normal protein structures and the oligomer-specific antibodies are thought to recognize these steric zipper patterns on the surface of the sheets. Since all proteins are made up using the same 20 amino acids, any sequence in this parallel, in-register structure gives rise to the same steric zippers regardless of the linear sequence, which can explain why the antibodies recognize the oligomers formed by different proteins.\nDr. Moir\u2019s group is working on CAPs, where A\u00df is cross-linked by oxidation of a tyrosine residue at position 10 of the peptides\u2019 sequence. A\u00df is oxidized after it is produced from the amyloid precursor protein as a consequence of the abnormally high level of oxidative activity in a brain with AD and the peptides\u2019 propensity to bind redox active metals. Excessive CAPs generation is associated with the disease state and is not a normal feature of A\u00df biology. The cross-linking at tyrosine 10 that gives rise to CAPs may serve to align the peptides in a parallel, in-register fashion and promote the generation of still-larger oligomeric aggregates that display steric zippers on their surface.\nDr. Moir and Dr. Rudy Tanzi\u2019s labs found that natural antibodies to CAPs are reduced in the blood of patients with AD. More recently, evidence published by Tony Weiss-Coray\u2019s group at Stanford University supports the idea that antibodies that recognize steric zippers and CAPs may be important for protecting against Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The levels of these antibodies that target the zippers and CAPs were among the highest in young, normal humans; levels dropped with aging and with AD. Furthermore, the results of a recent study supported by Baxter Biosciences of patients that received human antibodies purified from normal individuals (IVIg) reported that antibody treatment reduced the risk of being diagnosed with AD by 42 percent over the five-year study period. This is one of the most remarkable reports of prevention of AD by any therapy. Although the normal human antibodies that target amyloid primarily recognize the steric zippers and CAPs, these antibodies are present at relatively low levels. It is reasonable to imagine that an even greater protective effect might be achieved by boosting the levels of these protective antibodies by either active vaccination or passive immunization.\nFigure 1 shows how the same steric zipper patterns are formed on parallel, in-register oligomers from completely different sequences. A segment of the A\u00df sequences is shown in the upper left corner and a random sequence is shown in the upper right. Each amino acid is designated by a capital letter. Typical antibodies recognize the linear sequence (from left to right) indicated in the horizontal boxes, which is unique to each sequence. When the peptides aggregate to form pathological oligomers, they line up in a parallel, in-register fashion, shown below. This gives rise to steric zippers that run up and down the sheet perpendicular to the sequence, shown in vertical boxes. Aggregation-dependent, disease-specific antibodies recognize the steric zippers from many different amyloid sequences. Zippers from F and V amino acids are shown in boxes, but there are potentially 20 different zippers; one for each of the 20 amino acids.\nThe fact that a completely random sequence can form the same type of steric zipper as is found in A\u00df amyloid in Alzheimer\u2019s disease means we can use a non-human, random peptide sequence as a vaccine to produce a protective immune response that has a very low potential for autoimmune side effects. Vaccines based on non-human peptides, like diphtheria and pertussis toxin, are so safe they routinely are given to infants. There is no reason to expect that a vaccine for AD that targets the disease-specific steric zippers wouldn\u2019t be as safe and free of side effects. A goal of the research funded by Cure Alzheimer\u2019s Fund is to do the preclinical investigations that are a necessary prelude to getting these third-generation vaccines and monoclonal antibodies that target disease-specific epitopes into human clinical trials.","id":"<urn:uuid:063831fb-bde6-43d4-95fe-4286849bf7d1>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.curealzfund.org\/2009\/10\/vaccination-and-immunotherapy-alzheimer%E2%80%99s-disease?page=70","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9405506849,"token_count":2013,"score":2.890625,"int_score":3}

With the aid of a PR2, Henry was able to scratch an itch for himself for the first time in 10 years.\nWhile this is only a first step, it demonstrates how people with severe physical disabilities could use personal robots to gain independence. In another example, Henry recently used the PR2 to shave his cheek. We are actively researching ways for Henry and others to perform tasks like these on a daily basis.\nCurrently, Henry uses a head tracker to operate a variety of experimental user interfaces. These interfaces allow him to directly move the robot's body, including its arms and head. They also let him invoke autonomous actions, such as navigating in a room and reaching out to a location.\nRobots that complement human abilities are extremely valuable, especially when they help us do things that we can't do by ourselves. Our goal is to get robots in homes to help people like Henry and Jane Evans. This is just the beginning.\nLeila Takayama Recognized by MIT Technology Review's TR35 Listing of the World's Top Young Innovators for 2012","id":"<urn:uuid:a598bb26-9bcf-4c37-b446-316a1826452a>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.willowgarage.com\/blog\/2011\/07\/13\/robots-humanity?page=4","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9684308171,"token_count":363,"score":3.015625,"int_score":3}
{"text":"| ||What Your Doctor Is Saying || |\nWhat Are the Odds? Understanding Risk\nLast reviewed on September 12, 2012\nBy Robert H. Shmerling, M.D.\nBeth Israel Deaconess Medical Center\n\"If you take this medication, you will reduce your risk of disease by 20%, and 98% of people taking it have no serious side effects.\"\nSounds good, right? Perhaps not. What if your chance of getting the disease is only one in 1,000 but two people out of every 100 experience a deadly side effect?\nTalk About Risk\nDoctors, nurses, reporters and drug advertisers often talk about risk, though they may not call it that. In fact, they often use other terms that sound logical and understandable such as \"chance\" or \"likelihood\" (as in \"if you smoke, you will increase your chances of having lung disease\"). Alternatively, they may couch the terms in personal experience (as in \"I think this medicine will help you; it works for most of my patients\"). Or, the message may be even more vague: When a doctor says \"I think this therapy will help and I doubt it will cause you any problems,\" the doctor is really saying he or she hopes it helps because it usually does, but that there is a risk that the medication will cause side effects and\/or that it will not work.\nWhether or not the word is used, these are all examples of risk, the notion that something might or might not happen and that the likelihood is not zero or 100%. I was taught in medical school to \"never say never and never say always,\" because absolute certainty is so rare.\nBack to top\nRisk Is Not Simple\nRisk is a trickier concept than many people think. It may seem like something to avoid at all costs, but the fact is that while you may be able to choose one risk over another, you cannot always avoid risk altogether. Avoiding one risk may pose other risks. For example, if you have high blood pressure and a doctor prescribes a medication to lower it, there is a risk of side effects from the medication; but by avoiding the risk of having a side effect, you increase the risk that you will have a stroke due to untreated high blood pressure.\nMany people view any risk at all as a terrible thing, but it is important to realize that it represents a chance that something will happen, not a certainty. Even when talking about bad outcomes (such as the risk of surgery or the risk of medication side effects), there is often an excellent chance that nothing bad will happen.\nConsider this example. For a person suffering chronic arthritis and terrible joint pain for the last two years, symptoms probably will continue unless something changes (such as starting an effective treatment). The risk of side effects from any medication is clearly important, but it must be weighed against the high risk that joint pain will continue. If three out of 100 people taking a high-dose anti-inflammatory medication (such as ibuprofen) develop a stomach ulcer each year (that is, if the yearly risk is 3%), it is important to weigh that against the risk of ongoing pain (which is much higher). And it also means that 97 out of 100 people will not suffer an ulcer as they enjoy the benefits of the medication.\nBack to top\nThe Confusing Ways To Describe Risk\nThe other reason risk is confusing is that there are many ways it can be described. People may choose one way to describe risk to emphasize how high it is, while others use another way to express the same risk to downplay it. Remarkably, the same risk can seem quite different depending on how it is expressed.\nOne of the most common areas of confusion comes with the difference between absolute risk and relative risk. Imagine that you are offered a choice of two medications to reduce your risk of a heart attack:\n- Medication A will decrease your risk of heart attack by 20%.\n- Medication B reduces your risk from 5% to 4%.\nIf you think that Medication A sounds better, you are not alone. Relative risk is described, by comparing the new risk with the risk before treatment. Although vitally important, the actual risk with and without the medicine is not mentioned for Medication A. If you thought Medication B sounds less impressive, perhaps it's because knowing that the starting and ending risks are similar that is, knowing the actual, or absolute, risks makes the change seem less dramatic. This is particularly true when overall risk is very low or very high in the first place. Although they provide a more accurate assessment of risk, expressions of absolute risk are often missing from news or ads.\nMost of us would think that Medication A is better. But as described, Medication A and B could be the same drug. Reducing a risk of 5 in 100 to 4 in 100 is identical to a 20% relative risk reduction.\nSo it is not surprising that what you usually read in news reports and see in advertisements are changes in relative risk rather than the more critical number, the absolute risk. The relative risk tends to be the larger and more persuasive number. For the person or advertiser trying to make a dramatic point, most people find it easier to relate to one number (20% risk reduction for medication A) rather than keeping track of the initial risk and how it changes with treatment (5% to 4% for medication B). However, the simplicity of relative risk comes at the cost of incomplete and potentially misleading information. Without knowing where you started, a relative risk reduction of 20% can be nearly meaningless.\nConsider one of the most commonly prescribed medications in the world: the birth control pill. For nonsmoking women aged 25 to 29, the risk of death attributed to side effects of the pill is estimated at about 1 in 100,000 and doubles for women who are 30 to 34. If a 33-year-old woman were told she has twice the risk of dying from a birth control pill than a woman under 30, she might incorrectly interpret this as high risk. In fact, even though her risk is slightly higher than for younger women (by 0.001%), she is actually at a very low risk of dying, even lower than the estimated risk of death related to childbirth (10 to 25 per 100,000, also rising with age).\nThere are, of course, other ways to express risk that shape how it is perceived. Reports of new cases of prostate cancer diagnosed \"every three minutes\" or the lifetime risk of breast cancer being one in nine, are not very helpful in understanding your own particular risk. Estimating your individual risk by considering factors known to affect it (for example, smoking, which dramatically increases the risk of lung cancer) is a better way to express risk. The generally quoted figure for the risk of getting struck by lightning is 1 in 600,000, but it's much greater if you are holding a metal rod (for instance, a golf club) on a hill during a thunderstorm.\nRisk tends to be better understood when broken down by a finite length of time, such as five or 10 years, rather than over one's entire life. Reports of lifetime risk may also include disease that has no bearing on one's overall health, such as a slow-growing prostate tumor that never affects health or longevity (a common scenario among elderly men).\nBack to top\nThe Bottom Line\nIt is important to acknowledge that risk is easy to misunderstand even with accurate and unbiased information. Cynics say statistics can be used to argue any position, and there is some truth to that. But there are some simple measures you can take to get a better handle on risk:\n- Acknowledge that risk is a fact of life and often cannot be avoided entirely. In fact, most decisions one makes about how to prevent or treat disease depend on balancing the risks and benefits of the treatment options.\n- Look for reports that put the risk in context. One way is to compare one risk to another, more familiar risk. For example, the risk of contracting a rare disease could be compared with being struck by lightning, while a more common condition could be compared with the risk of injury or death in a car accident.\n- Ask yourself if the source is objective and seeks only to inform you, or whether there is another goal in mind. Sometimes it's easy: If the source is an advertiser trying to sell you something, the information is more likely to be biased.\n- Beware of reports that use lifetime risk or ones that convert the number of cases per year to cases per day or hour. Even if they are technically accurate, they are probably overemphasizing the point.\nWhat matters most is the absolute rather than the relative risk. In my initial example of the drug with a 20% relative risk reduction with no serious side effects in 98% of users, two fewer people out of every 10,000 would get the disease, but 200 would experience a deadly side effect clearly an example of a treatment that is worse than the disease. But it's also an example of how misleading descriptions of risk can be.\nBack to top\nRobert H.

{"text":"Eighteen years ago, the eminent conservation biologist Gary Meffe warned of what he considered to be the greatest problem in human history \u2013 humanity\u2019s inexorable and exponential increase in numbers.\nMeffe\u2019s paper, entitled \u2018Human Population Control: The Missing Agenda\u2019 published in the journal Conservation Biology, outlined the threats posed by an ever-increasing human population to biodiversity in terms of species extinctions, and to the ecosystem services necessary for our survival. These include water and air purification, hydrologic cycling and food production. Not only is humanity\u2019s deluge drowning the creatures we share the Earth with, but it also runs the risk of submerging itself too. But was this \u2018missing agenda\u2019 acknowledged? Was a dam constructed to stem our exponential flow?\nNearly two decades later and we see the publication of the UN\u2019s State of World Population report 2011. It announced that on October 31st we reached the population milestone of seven billion people inhabiting our world. Instead of warning of future population growth and the associated negative impact, it had a more positive tone that encouraged us to ask \u201cWhat can I do to make our world better?\u201d rather than \u201cAre we too many?\u201d This is the United Nations after all, and understandably it has to take a progressive and reassuring stance rather than one of doom and gloom. But the angle taken is perhaps revealing of the prevailing attitude of the global collective consciousness \u2013 population growth is inevitable and cannot be stopped. Of course there\u2019s no such thing as a global collective consciousness, explaining in part why Meffe\u2019s view has been largely ignored, because humanity lacks a collective impetus and so anything that requires mass cohesion, for instance only having one child or reducing carbon emissions, is doomed to fail.\nSeven billion people \u2013 it\u2019s enough to make you feel insignificant. Except it\u2019s not, it\u2019s just a number. A very big number too large to visualise, grasp or comprehend. Incidentally, if you\u2019re ever having trouble feeling insignificant, then listen to what the \u2018Woody Allen\u2019 of science, Lawrence Krauss has to say. In his recent lecture on cosmic connections for The School of Life he stated that \u201cyou are much more insignificant than you thought\u201d before going on to compete with Brian Cox for the title of \u2018King of making outlandish profound points\u2019, by explaining how we are all quite literally \u201cmade of stars\u201d. Every atom in our bodies comes from the remnants of an exploded star. It turns out Moby was right (see video below).\nThis digression aside, the ineffably large human population will continue to increase and even if we wanted to implement population control, doing so would be unethical and practically speaking impossible. Very few people, not even many devout conservationists, would be willing to sacrifice the right to have children. I for one wouldn\u2019t, it is in our evolutionary spirit.\nInstead of tackling the so called \u2018root cause\u2019 of the population problem by implementing unrealistic, unfavourable, and unwanted population control, efforts have been directed at addressing offshoot issues such as those relating to overconsumption and overexploitation of natural resources. If we can adopt new cleaner technologies and practices to ensure our impact on the environment is neutral or at least negligible, it will be a step in the right direction.\nJust this week the production of a \u2018microbial fuel cell\u2019 has been announced which can purportedly produce electricity from human urine! Researchers at the University of the West of England (UWE) have found that by utilising anaerobic bacteria as they metabolise organic waste waters, electrons can be harnessed and useful electricity generated. By \u2018useful\u2019 it is meant that enough electricity would be generated to charge a battery say, but presumably not enough to heat a home for instance, yet.\nFor now, no one is suggesting this is the answer to the world\u2019s problems, but switching to technologies that rely less on finite Earth resources and more on recycling waste products will help ameliorate the effects our species has on the planet. Unfortunately though, those who sing the praises of such advances are often branded with the stigma of being too \u2018preachy\u2019. Increasing public apathy to important issues such as clean technology, climate change and biodiversity decline should be at least as worrying to everyone as financial crises or global terrorism.","id":"<urn:uuid:64dc3877-7576-45b7-ba6f-426f5ac11fa2>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www2.imperial.ac.uk\/blog\/studentblogs\/christopher-n\/2011\/12\/01\/the-human-flood-perceptions-of-the-threats-posed-by-population-growth\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.945068419,"token_count":920,"score":2.59375,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Freshwater Drum - (Aplodinotus grunniens)\nLength: up to about 14 inches, although it may become quite large in rivers\nWeight: 5-15 pounds, world record is 54 1\/2 pounds\nColoring: Gray or silvery in turbid waters, bronze-colored in clearer waters. The head is somewhat darker than the rest of the body; the ventral portion of the fish is white. The pectoral and pelvic fins are white, but the rest of the fins are dusky.\nCommon Names: sheepshead, croaker, thunder pumper, lake drum, grunt, bubbler, grinder\nFound in Lakes: all Great Lakes\nThe freshwater drum is the only member of its family that lives entirely in freshwater habitats, and it has the largest native range of any sport fish in the region. Drum are an important commercial crop on the Mississippi River but constitute only a small portion of the commercial perch catch in Lake Michigan.\nThe drum earned part of its Latin name, \"grunniens\" (meaning \"grunting\"), by its odd grunting noises, which are produced by a special set of muscles located in the body cavity that vibrates against the swim bladder. The purpose of the noise is unknown, but only mature males develop the structure (by the time they reach three years of age), suggesting that it is most likely related to spawning. Drums also may croak like bullfrogs when removed from the water, and scientists still don't know if the croaking noise is generated in the same way.\nIdentification of this fish is fairly easy. Drum have two dorsal fins that are joined by a narrow membrane. The anterior fin is spiny, and the posterior fin has soft rays. The are the only fish found in Wisconsin with a lateral line that extends through the caudal fin.\nThe drum's otoliths are exceptionally large and look a great deal like ivory. In times past they have been worn as protective amulets, made into jewelry, and traded into areas far from the fish's native range (such as Utah and California).\nDrum are a bottom-dwelling species found in lakes and rivers; they tolerate both clear and turbid conditions. Their diet consists mainly of immature insects, crayfish, and minnows, although they may also feed on mollusks.\nThe white, flaky flesh of the drum is tasty and has a low oil content. (nutritional information) When cooking, be sure that the fish doesn't dry out and become hard. The low oil content means that fillets dry out much more quickly than other, more oily, fish. Recommended cooking methods include pan frying (in batter) or deep fat frying. Smoking also works well, as long as you're careful not to heat them for too long.\nFreshwater drum are good fighters and will take bait such as crayfish, minnows, and worms. In warm weather they move in schools to shallow waters to feed and possibly spawn (spawning has not been witnessed by scientists). By winter their activity levels and feeding activity are sharply reduced.\ncopyright 2001 University of Wisconsin Sea Grant Institute\nThis page is Bobby Approved.","id":"<urn:uuid:ef121ba7-f769-4750-b9e3-25ccd8ef6491>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/seagrant.wisc.edu\/greatlakesfish\/textonly\/drum.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9645994902,"token_count":664,"score":2.9375,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Scientists have revealed that new treatments for the incurable nerve disease known as Lou Gehrig's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) could be developed via a long-used anti-cancer drug.\nTheir research showing how the drug prevents clumping of an enzyme linked to ALS appears in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.\nLucia Banci, Ivano Bertini and colleagues explain that ALS causes a progressive loss of muscle control as the nerves that control body movements wither and die. Patients become weak and have difficulty swallowing and breathing, and most die within three to five years of diagnosis. Although some ALS cases are hereditary and run in families, about 90 percent are \"sporadic,\" with the cause unknown. Some research links sporadic ALS to clumping of an antioxidant enzyme called hSOD1. The authors explored whether cisplatin, a chemotherapy drug used since the 1960s that is known to interact with some of the enzyme's amino acids, has any effect on hSOD1 clusters.\nThe scientists found that in laboratory tests, the anti-cancer drug cisplatin bound readily to the enzyme, preventing hSOD1 from aggregating and dissolving existing bunches. Cisplatin targets sites that can form bonds between hSOD1 after the enzyme loses the atom of copper it normally carries. The scientists note that cisplatin does not prevent the enzyme from performing its normal functions. \"From this work it appears that cisplatin is a promising lead compound for the rational design of ALS treatments,\" the authors say.","id":"<urn:uuid:d0f8a42e-9fa9-4f76-ac42-8a63bfcbbf8d>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.medindia.net\/news\/treatments-for-lou-gehrigs-disease-via-anti-cancer-drug-from-the-1960s-102798-1.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9480875134,"token_count":315,"score":3.28125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"In the interior of central Africa the first\nCatholic missions were established by Cardinal Lavigerie's White Fathers in 1879. In Uganda some\nprogress was made under the not unfriendly local ruler, Mtesa; but his successor, Mwanga, determined\nto root out Christianity among his people, especially after a Catholic subject, St. Joseph Mkasa,\nreproached him for his debauchery and for his massacre of the Protestant missionary James Hannington\nand his caravan. Mwanga was addicted to unnatural vice and his anger against Christianity, already\nkindled by ambitious officers who played on his fears, was kept alight by the refusal of Christian\nboys in his service to minister to his wickedness.\nhimself was the first victim: Mwanga. seized on a trifling pretext and on November 15, 1885, had him\nbeheaded. To the chieftain's astonishment the Christians were not cowed by this sudden outrage, and\nin May of the following year the storm burst. When he called for a young 'page' called Mwafu, Mwanga\nlearned that he had been receiving religious instruction from another page, St. Denis Sebuggwawo;\nDenis was sent for, and the king thrust a spear through his throat. That night guards were posted\nround the royal residence to prevent anyone from escaping.\nCharles Lwanga, who had succeeded Joseph Mkasa in charge of the 'pages', secretly baptized four of\nthem who were catechumens; among them St Kizito, a boy of thirteen whom Lwanga had repeatedly saved\nfrom the designs of the king. Next morning the pages were all drawn up before Mwanga, and Christians\nwere ordered to separate themselves from the rest: led by Lwanga and Kizito, the oldest and\nyoungest, they did so\u2014fifteen young men, all under twenty-five years of age. They were joined by two\nothers already under arrest and by two soldiers. Mwanga asked them if they intended to remain\nChristians. \"Till death!\" came the response. \"Then put them to death!\"\nThe appointed place of execution, Namugongo, was thirty-seven miles away, and the convoy set out at once. Three of the youths were killed on the road; the others underwent a cruel imprisonment of seven days at Namugongo while a huge pyre was prepared. Then on Ascension day, June 3, 1886, they were brought out, stripped of their clothing, bound, and each wrapped in a mat of reed: the living faggots were laid on the pyre (one boy, St Mbaga, was first killed by a blow on the neck by order of his father who was the chief executioner), and it was set alight.\nThe persecution spread and Protestants as well\nas Catholics gave their lives rather than deny Christ. A leader among the confessors was St Matthias\nMurumba, who was put to death with revolting cruelty; he was a middle-aged man, assistant judge to\nthe provincial chief, who first heard of Jesus Christ from Protestant missionaries and later was\nbaptized by Father Livinhac, W.F. Another older victim, who was beheaded, was St Andrew Kagwa, chief\nof Kigowa, who had been the instrument of his wife's conversion and had gathered a large body of\ncatechumens round him. This Andrew together with Charles Lwanga and Matthias Murumba and nineteen\nothers (seventeen of the total being young royal servants) were solemnly beatified in 1920. They\nwere canonized in 1964.\nWhen the White Fathers were expelled from the country, the new Christians carried on their work, translating and printing the catechism into their nativel language and giving secret instruction on the faith. Without priests, liturgy, and sacraments their faith, intelligence, courage, and wisdom kept the Catholic Church alive and growing in Uganda. When the White Fathers returned after King Mwanga's death, they found five hundred Christians and one thousand catchumens waiting for them.\nJoin the new media evangelization.

{"text":"What is an estimate?\n\u201cAn 'Estimate' is a computer-generated approximation of a property's market value calculated by means of the Automated Value Model (AVM). As such, an Estimate is calculated on the basis of:\n- Publicly available tax assessment records for the property\n- Recent sale prices of comparable properties in the same area\nThere are many additional factors that determine a property's actual market value, including its condition, house style, layout, special features, quality of workmanship, and so on. For this reason, an Estimate should not be viewed as an appraisal, but rather as an approximate basis for making comparisons, and as a starting point for further inquiry.

{"text":"Viewed against a dangerous and costly backdrop, clear team communication is obviously essential to create a safe, productive and effective work environment on the ramp. Tractor operators and wing walkers need to warn each other of impending dangers. The tractor operator needs to keep the flight deck informed of ground movement. And all ground personnel should at least be able to hear the flight deck and each other during a pushback.\nRamp workers can do much more without the wire, the shouting or the hand signals.\nA typical wireless pushback and towing configuration uses a portable transceiver for continuous two-way communication among one or more wing walkers and the tractor operator during aircraft movement. The tractor operator is free to concentrate on correct maneuvering, and all crew members can warn others instantly of impending dangers.\nTo optimize the flow of communication and minimize chatter, the system is configured so that all team members can hear the pilot, but only the tractor operator can talk directly to the flight deck. Because wireless communication increases coordination and enables real-time verbal warnings, it decreases the risk of accidents, shortens turn-around times, and increases the likelihood of hitting flight slots.\nIn addition to pushbacks and towing, wireless team communication systems can also be used to improve safety and efficiency during deicing, cargo and maintenance operations. In a deicing configuration, a wireless system connects the driver and the basket, and the system itself can be connected to two-way radios enabling communication with remote users.\nCommunication between the driver and the basket takes place on open microphone over a 1.9GHz (1.8GHz in the EU) encrypted frequency while also allowing radio monitoring and transmitting with a push to-talk button on the headsets. Systems can be configured to enable multiple deicing crews to communicate while working on the same aircraft - further improving efficiency. Additional configurations are available for maintenance teams and are scalable to almost any size.\nChoosing a Wireless Communication System\nWireless headset systems are available in a wide variety of configurations and price ranges. To ensure a system meets the diverse needs of ground support, consider the following factors carefully:\nIs the system truly wireless? A number of so-called \u201cwireless\u201d systems actually require a wire from the headset to a radio or belt pack. While these systems allow freedom of movement, a belt pack or radio wire creates many of the same problems inherent in hardwire systems, particularly tangled cords. Moreover, belt packs generally have less than half the transmission range of self-contained systems worn on the head.\nDoes the system use DECT or Bluetooth technology? Transmission technology can dramatically affect how well wireless systems perform in the field. Systems that employ Bluetooth technology generally have a limited range and are subject to radio frequency interference from nearby devices.\nLook for systems that use Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications technology. DECT units generally offer up to 30 times more coverage and are less subject to interference than Bluetooth. DECT transmissions also have multipath capability, meaning the signal will bounce up, over and around objects in order to establish the best possible connection. DECT signals are also digitally encoded to ensure privacy.\nIs the system full-duplex or half-duplex? Half-duplex systems allow communication in both directions, but only one direction at a time. That\u2019s a walkie-talkie. On the other hand, full-duplex systems allow communication in both directions simultaneously. Full-duplex capabilities are an important safety consideration because they allow the parties to speak and hear others at the same time.\nIs the system radio-compatible? Communication during pushback and towing is generally confined to the flight deck, wing walkers and tractor operator; however, other ground support functions may benefit from the ability to communicate with remote users over a two-way radio. Look for a system with maximum radio-interface flexibility.","id":"<urn:uuid:64b6024d-747e-42b4-94a5-ce98e783c943>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.aviationpros.com\/article\/10603970\/wireless-headsets-for-team-communication-improve-ramp-safety?page=2","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9268864989,"token_count":784,"score":2.578125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Disease outbreaks, such as cholera, are commonly thought to happen after earthquakes and other natural disasters, but studies have found no evidence to support this. And the persistence of this belief may be hurting relief efforts.\nThe devastating earthquake in Haiti in January 2010 was followed by a deadly cholera outbreak. Many saw this as an inevitable outcome of the disaster, as poor sanitary conditions combined with numerous dead bodies and survivors housed in cramped quarters to produce an incubator for deadly diseases.\n\u201cIt\u2019s what all of us worried about when we arrived in Haiti just hours after the quake,\u201d said NBC's Brian Williams, according to Popular Science. \u201cBeyond the death toll, the inevitable spread of disease.\u201d\nHowever, a forensic analysis of the outbreak has shown that it had very little to do with either the earthquake or the conditions in Haiti afterwards.\nThe spread of the disease was traced back to a small military base, that was built years before, and its faulty sanitation system that allowed human fecal matter to pollute the nearby river. Analysis of the strain of Vibrio cholerae that swept through the Haitian population showed that it was identical to the one that was infecting people in Nepal, where some of the soldiers at the base were stationed before they joined the Haiti relief efforts.\n[ More Geekquinox: Man maps out stunning Earth-like Mars ]\nThe problem with the belief in the 'inevitability' of the outbreak, according to what journalist and author Jonathan M. Katz wrote in his PopSci article, is \"most journalists and responders shrugged off cholera as a natural product of the disaster. The attitude made epidemiologists and aid workers less likely to seek out the source of what was in fact a particular infection not only new to Haiti, but the entire hemisphere.\"\n\"And it has since continued to provide cover for the United Nations as advocates press for reparations, and public health experts try to reform the peacekeeping system to prevent such a catastrophic error from happening again.\" he added.\n\"Conditioned to look for a problem that wasn\u2019t there, responders ignored the greatest public health threat of all: themselves.\"","id":"<urn:uuid:ab2f6e4b-0c56-4387-9ee3-1c5083ea9e1c>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/ca.news.yahoo.com\/blogs\/geekquinox\/relief-efforts-more-likely-cause-disease-disasters-themselves-181839327.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9740083814,"token_count":449,"score":3.796875,"int_score":4}
{"text":"Session 5Guided Channel-TalkLife Posting\nDogs and cats are great examples of animals whose diversity is the result of artificial selection. The variation that is evident among breeds has been purposefully developed by breeders. In your Channel-TalkLife posting for this session, describe how you could develop a unit on the fundamentals of evolution (e.g., variation, adaptation, natural selection) using these animals. Be sure to discuss how you would tailor the concepts addressed during this session to the grade level you teach.\nBreeders for thousands of years have bred dogs for particular purpose. In ancient China the Chow was admired for its loyalty to owner and its ability to withstand harsh temperatures. The poodle swims very well and is very intelligent. The terrier breed is known for its tenacity and for catching rats. In third grade I would ask each student to chose a breed of dog or cat and then research the characteristics of that breed in regard to physical traits. I would then ask the students to share with the class how the breed differs from others and why breeders have selected those qualities. I would then discuss how it is that breeders can purposefully bred dogs that have puppies with those desirable characteristics.\nSession 6 Guided Channel-TalkLife Posting\nBoth the National Science Education Standards and Benchmarks for Scientific Literacy propose standards or goals for understanding big ideas in evolution starting in the elementary grades. Of the ideas addressed in Session 5 (variation, genes, mutation, adaptation, natural selection, artificial selection) and Session 6 species, evolution of new species, relatedness, common ancestry, tree of life), which do you consider appropriate introduce at the grade level you teach? Why? Discuss this with your colleagues in your Channel-TalkLife posting for this session. Be sure to share any experiences you've had.\nIn third grade appropriate concepts to introduce are: variation adaptation, genes, natural selection, artificial selection, species, evolution of new species, tree of life and common ancestry. I think that if conversations develop within the classroom at an early age that teachers should have the knowledge and background in science to explain these concepts in an age appropriate way. I think that it would be unprofessional to teach the vocabulary only and not provide hands-on activities for younger children to be able to begin making connections with these concepts. I have taught some evolutionary concepts when our classroom conversations went in that direction, but evolution is not part of the third grade curriculum.\nChannel-talklife mailing list\nReceived on Sun Oct 9 20:28:07 2005","id":"<urn:uuid:4354e8a3-68d8-468b-ade1-61e23eca1030>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.learner.org\/courses\/essential\/life\/channeltalk\/0064.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9331815243,"token_count":517,"score":3.78125,"int_score":4}

If its API gravity is greater than 10, it is lighter and floats on water; if less than 10, it is heavier and sinks.

Heavy oil is defined as having an API gravity below 22.3, Medium oil is defined as having an API gravity between 22.3 \u00b0API and 31.1 \u00b0API, Light crude oil is defined as having an API gravity higher than 31.1.\nAt a production rate of 3 million barells a day the tar sands can last for 170 years.

There are at least 3 major proposals for nat gas pipelines from the North Slope area and the adjacent Mackenzie River Delta in Canada. 2 of these projects point right at Alberta.\nTransCanada and Exxon Mobil are partnered in the Alaska gas pipeline proposal that will directly link nat gas production in the North Slope of ALaska thru Alberta to the US mid west.

{"text":"What Is It?\nVaricose veins occur when veins just below the skin's surface are damaged, become swollen and fill with too much blood.\nVeins are the blood vessels that return blood to the heart. Arteries carry blood away from the heart to the rest of the body.\nVaricose veins most commonly occur in the legs. In about 50% of cases, the condition runs in families, and probably is related to an inherited weakness in the veins' walls or the valves inside veins that keep blood from backing up.\nPregnancy is another common cause of varicose veins. During pregnancy, the volume of blood increases causing veins to expand. Also, occupations that require uninterrupted standing (waitresses and waiters, nurses, mothers with young children) may force leg veins and valves to work against gravity for hours, increasing the risk of pressure-related vein and valve damage. Garters also can increase the risk of varicose veins if their tight elastics slow blood flow in the legs.\nVaricose veins are 2 to 3 times more common in women than men. Obese people are more likely to develop varicose veins.\nVaricose veins can be associated with prior blood clots and damage to the deeper veins in one or both legs, a situation that sometimes can lead to chronic venous insufficiency. When this happens, the veins lose their ability to effectively move blood back to the heart. This can cause significant leg swelling and skin sores or ulcers.\nIn the legs, varicose veins commonly are found along the inside of the leg, at the ankles and at the back of the calf. The affected veins look blue, swollen or stretched out, kinked or twisted.\nIn some people, varicose veins do not cause any symptoms. However, other people may experience one or more of the following:\n- A dull ache in the legs\n- A feeling of pressure or heaviness in the legs\n- Swollen feet and ankles\n- Itching skin near the damaged veins\nIn more severe cases of chronic venous insufficiency, a slowing of blood flow through the vein can lead to localized skin changes, including dryness, a rash or brownish discoloration and open sores (ulcers). Slow blood flow also can cause a clot to form inside the affected vein. This condition is called thrombosis.\nIn general, symptoms of varicose veins are worse at the end of the day, especially after periods of prolonged standing. Some women also find that their symptoms are more intense during the days before their menstrual periods, and during pregnancy.\nYour doctor will ask you about your symptoms and about your family history of varicose veins. He or she also will ask about your lifestyle, especially the number of hours that you spend on your feet. In women, your doctor will ask about your pregnancy history and about the tightness of elastics on the socks or stockings you wear.\nYour doctor can diagnose varicose veins with a simple physical examination. In most cases, no special tests are necessary.\nVaricose veins are a long-term problem, but symptoms can come and go. If you are pregnant and experiencing severe problems with varicose veins, your symptoms will improve after delivery. However, your varicose veins probably will not disappear totally, and you can expect symptoms to return during future pregnancies.\nYou can help to prevent varicose veins by maintaining a normal weight and by avoiding situations where you must stand for prolonged periods. Even with these preventive measures, however, you still may develop varicose veins if this condition tends to run in your family.\nIf you already have varicose veins, you can prevent symptom flare-ups by periodically lying down or sitting down with your legs elevated above the level of your chest. Some physicians also recommend that you wear support stockings or more specialized compression stockings when you walk or stand for long periods of time. The stockings prevent blood from pooling in the veins, and prevent strain on the valves and leg swelling.\nTreatment for most people with mild symptoms of varicose veins includes:\n- Elevating and supporting the legs periodically throughout the day\n- Wearing compression stockings\nFor varicose veins that are close to the skin, dermatologists or vascular surgeons may offer sclerotherapy or laser therapy. Sclerotherapy involves injection of an irritating into the affected vein, causing the vein to scar and shut down. Laser therapy can be effective for the smallest varicose veins.\nPeople with severe venous insufficiency can develop recurrent blood clots and skin ulcers. The traditional surgery is called vein stripping and ligation. In this surgical procedure, the abnormal veins are tied off and pulled out of the body through series of small cuts in the skin. Another surgical procedure, called ambulatory phlebectomy, also removes veins through small skin incisions, but it is less invasive than classic stripping and ligation.\nNewer therapies include endovenous thermal ablation and transilluminated power phlebotomy (a modified form of ambulatory phlebotomy). Endovenous thermal ablation uses laser or high-frequency radio waves to heat the abnormal veins. These newer procedures appear to cause less scarring, with less \"down time.\"\nExternal laser therapy is reserved primarily for cosmetic removal of small, superficial, spider-like veins.\nWhen to Call a Professional\nCall your doctor whenever you have pain, swelling, skin ulcers or an unexplained area of bruising on your legs. New leg swelling, especially in just one leg, can be caused by a blood clot, which requires immediate treatment.\nIf you have varicose veins, call your doctor immediately if you develop an ulcer or a painful, black and blue area near a varicose vein or if you cut the skin over a varicose vein and you have trouble controlling the bleeding.\nVaricose veins are a long-term problem, but their symptoms often can be controlled with leg elevation and therapeutic stockings.\nSurgical procedures remove varicose veins permanently, but they leave scars, and they cannot prevent new varicose veins from forming.\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)\nP.O.

We are mostly unaware of its workings; for example, when blood vessels change size or when our heart beats faster, these functions are involuntary and reflexive in nature.\nThe ANS has 3 parts -\n- The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) which kicks in when emergencies occur, causing stress and requiring us to \u201cfight\u201d or take \u201cflight\u201d (flee)\n- The parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS) which operates in normal or nonemergency times, allowing us to \u201crest\u201d and \u201cdigest\u201d\n- The enteric nervous system (ENS), present in all vertebrates, which regulates the normal digestive activity of the digestive system and prepares it for whatever is coming, whether a meal or a frantic energy-sapping physical activity\nThe undereating phase of the Warrior Diet is supposed to prepare and alert the SNS to potential stress, resulting in the generation of energy and ultimately the burning of fat. While undereating, the body is forced to use fat storage as a source of fuel for maximum metabolic efficiency \u2013 thus promoting weight-loss.\nThe overeating phase of the Warrior Diet recognizes the role of the PSNS in regulating digestion, elimination and other metabolic activities that slow you down. Eating during the day stops this process and blocks the body\u2019s ability to remove toxins and waste from the body. Since detoxification is imperative for health and to delay aging, eating occurs mainly at night.\nWarrior Diet program\nThe program involves a Fat Loss Program and exercise and nutrition regimes.\nFat Loss Program\nThe Fat Loss program is specifically designed to\n- Force the body to detoxify\n- Improve utilization of fat as fuel\n- Improve utilization of carb as fuel\nThis process helps to boost overall metabolic rate, thereby enhancing the body\u2019s capacity to maximize fat loss.\nExercise and Nutrition Programs\nExercise and nutrition programs provide short, intense strength and aerobic exercises, along with pre-workout and post-workout meals. This approach intends to reduce fat while maintaining or improving muscle tone.\nThe emphasis of the Warrior Diet program is on having large evening meals on the one hand, and shedding the \u201ccalorie counting\u201d common to most diets on the other.\nThe Warrior Diet by Ori Hofmekler.","id":"<urn:uuid:e39ee72b-f208-43f0-9439-59a5d06c3a3a>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.everydiet.org\/diet\/warrior-diet","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9463229179,"token_count":688,"score":2.984375,"int_score":3}
{"text":"|Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) Detachment\nSigns and Symptoms\nIn most instances, serous detachment of the RPE occurs asymptomatically.\nOnly in those cases in which the macula is affected will patients report blurred vision,\nmetamorphopsia, micropsia, or positive scotomas. Other associated clinical findings may\ninclude induced hyperopia and delayed retinal recovery time on the photostress test. Most\nindividuals with RPE detachment are male, between the ages of 20 and 60 years. The history\noften reveals predisposing or concurrent ocular conditions such as macular degeneration,\nidiopathic central serous chorioretinopathy (ICSC), angioid streaks, presumed ocular\nhistoplasmosis syndrome (POHS), or hereditary choroidal degeneration. In other cases, the\ncondition occurs idiopathically.\nRPE detachment appears ophthalmoscopically as single or multiple,\nwell-circumscribed round or oval lesions within the posterior fundus. The lesions are\ntypically dome-shaped with slight elevation and appear yellow to orange in color. A\nreddish \"halo\" is often seen around the base of the detachment, and overlying\npigment defects such as clumping or mottling are commonplace. Lesions may vary in size\nfrom one-fifth to over 5 disc diameters (DD), but most are less than 1 DD. Fluorescein and\nindocyanine green (ICG) angiography show early hyperfluorescence of the entire RPE\ndetachment, which persists throughout the angiogram demonstrating late pooling. Leakage\ninto the sensory retina occurs only in cases of concurrent serous retinal detachment.\nRPE detachment is a non-specific anatomical alteration that may result from\nany number of choroidal disorders that disrupt the normal junction between the basement\nmembrane of the RPE and the inner collagenous layer of Bruchs membrane. This\ndisruption permits serous fluid from the underlying choriocapillaris to gain access into\nthe sub-RPE space. Age-related macular degeneration, choroidal neovascular membranes, high\nmyopia, angioid streaks, hereditary choroidal degeneration, POHS, and tumors of the\nchoroid have all been identified as precipitating conditions in the development of RPE\ndetachment. Idiopathic cases are sometimes associated with ICSC; some believe these two\nconditions to represent a continuum of a similar underlying pathology. Uncomplicated\nidiopathic serous detachments of the RPE often resolve spontaneously, however, those\nassociated with more generalized damage to the choriocapillaris may be complicated by\nhemorrhage, choroidal neovascular membrane formation, and disciform scarring.\nMost patients under the age of 55 who present with small serous RPE\ndetachments without evidence of other retinal or choroidal disease enjoy an excellent\nprognosis without intervention. This is particularly true if the lesion is outside of the\nfovea and there is no associated subretinal fluid.\nOlder patients who manifest RPE detachment without angiographic evidence\nof a choroidal neovascular membrane have a 25-30 percent chance of developing such\nmembranes during their lifetime, and therefore warrant careful observation as well as\nweekly home monitoring with an Amsler grid.\nThose patients over the age of 55 who present with associated choroidal\nneovascular membranes and\/or hemorrhagic RPE detachments have an exceedingly poor visual\nprognosis. Focal laser photocoagulation is indicated for these patients.\nApproximately 90 percent of cases of RPE detachment have\nor will manifest concurrent serous retinal detachment over the natural history of the\ndisorder. In cases of idiopathic RPE detachment, a striking similarity with ICSC is seen\nin the predisposed patient population; i.e. male, average age of 44 years, and a moderate\nto severe emotional stress level.\nThe presentation of RPE detachment is quite\ncharacteristic. Nonetheless, one must be sure to rule out other conditions that may appear\nsimilar from an ophthalmoscopic perspective. These include: ICSC, malignant melanoma,\nmetastatic carcinoma, choroidal hemangioma, and Bests disease (vitelliform\ndystrophy). History and angiography are the most helpful factors in making this\nRPE detachment in patients over 55 years of age should be\nconsidered secondary to choroidal neovascular membrane, rather than idiopathic, until\nproven otherwise. Prompt fluorescein angiography is mandatory in these cases.\nOther reports in this section","id":"<urn:uuid:1725cd67-7f79-4edd-9409-14c573c69b34>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/cms.revoptom.com\/handbook\/SECT42a.HTM","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.8823708296,"token_count":1014,"score":2.546875,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Now he\u2019s alerted me to a new study and related lecture on what he and his co-authors are calling \u201cpeak farmland\u201d \u2014 an impending stabilization of the amount of land required for food as humanity\u2019s growth spurt plays out. While laying out several important wild cards (expanded farming of biofuels among them), Ausubel and his co-authors see a reasonable prospect for conserving, and restoring, forests and other stressed terrestrial ecosystems even as humanity exerts an ever greater influence on the planet.\nThe study, \u201cPeak Farmland and the Prospects for Sparing Nature,\u201d is by Ausubel, Iddo K. Wernick and Paul E. Waggoner and will be published next year as part of a special supplement to the journal Population and Development Review, published by the Population Council.\nDrawing on a host of data sets, the authors conclude that a combination of slowing population growth, moderated demand for land-intensive food (meat, for instance) and more efficient farming methods have resulted in a substantial \u201cdecoupling\u201d of acreage and human appetites.\nHere\u2019s the optimistic opener:\nExpecting that more and richer people will demand more from the land, cultivating wider fields, logging more forests, and pressing nature, comes naturally. The past half-century of disciplined and dematerializing demand and more intense and efficient land use encourage a rational hope that humanity\u2019s pressure will not overwhelm nature.\nAusubel will describe the findings in a talk during a daylong symposium at his university on Tuesday honoring Paul Demeny, who at age 80 is stepping down as editor of the journal.\nAusubel\u2019s prepared remarks are online. In his talk, he explains that while the common perception is that meeting humanity\u2019s food needs is the task of farmers, there are many other players, including those of us who can choose what to eat and how many children to have:\n[T]he main actors are parents changing population, workers changing affluence, consumers changing the diet (more or less calories, more or less meat) and also the portion of crops entering the food supply (corn can fuel people or cars), and farmers changing the crop production per hectare of cropland (yield).\nThe new paper builds on a long string of studies by Ausubel and the others, including the 2001 paper \u201cHow Much Will Feeding More and Wealthier People Encroach on Forests?.\u201d Also relevant is \u201cRestoring the Forests,\u201d a 2000 article in Foreign Affairs co-written by Ausubel and David G. Victor (now at the University of California, San Diego)\nThis body of analysis is closely related to the core focus of this blog: finding ways to fit infinite human aspirations (and appetites) on a finite planet. The work presents a compelling case for concentrating agriculture through whatever hybrid mix of means \u2014 technological or traditional \u2014 that best fits particular situations, but also fostering moderation in consumption.\nHere\u2019s an excerpt from the paper\u2019s conclusion, which notes the many wild cards that make the peak farmland scenario still only a plausible, and hardly inevitable, future:\n[W]ild cards remain part of the game, both for and against land sparing. As discussed, the wild card of biofuels confounded expectations for the past 15 years. Most wild cards probably will continue to come from consumers. Will people choose to eat much more meat? If so, will it be beef, which requires more land than poultry and fish, which require less? Will people become vegetarian or even vegan? But if they become vegan, will they also choose clothing made from linen, hemp, and cotton, which require hectares? Will the average human continue to grow taller and thus require more calories? Will norms of beauty accept obesity and thus high average calories per capita? Will a global population with a median age of 40 eat less than one with a median age of 28? Will radical innovations in food production move humanity closer to landless agriculture (Ausubel 2010)? Will hunger or international investment encourage cropland expansion in Africa and South America? (Cropland may, of course, shrink in some countries while expanding in others as the global sum declines.) And will time moderate the disparities cloaked within global averages, in particular disparities of hunger and excess among regions and individuals?\nAllowing for wild cards, we believe that projecting conservative values for population, affluence, consumers, and technology shows humanity peaking in the use of farmland. Over the next 50 years, the prospect is that humanity is likely to release at least 146 mHa [146 million hectares, or 563,710 square miles], one and a half times the size of Egypt, two and a half times that of France, or ten Iowas, and possibly multiples of this amount.\nNotwithstanding the biofuels case, the trends of the past 15 years largely resemble those for the past 50 and 150. We see no evidence of exhaustion of the factors that allow the peaking of cropland and the subsequent restoration of nature.\nIn an e-mail exchange today, I asked Ausubel about another issue touched on in the paper:\nLooking around the planet, it\u2019s clear from a biodiversity standpoint that all forests \u2014 or farming pressures \u2014 are not equal. For instance, in Southeast Asia, palm oil and orangutans are having a particularly hard time co-existing. So while the overall trend is great, do you see the need for maintaining a focus on particular \u201chot spots,\u201d to use a term familiar in environmental circles?\nSo far, I don\u2019t see lots of evidence that conservation campaigners (you are one on ocean resources) have found a way to accept this kind of good news and\/or incorporate it in their prescriptions for sustaining a rich and variegated biological sheath on Earth. If you agree, any idea why?\nIndonesia is the number one place where letting the underlying trend work will not work fast enough. The list of threatened regions is quite well identified: parts of the central African forest, parts of the Amazon.\nSome conservation groups have realized that the slow growth in demand for calories as well as pulp and paper are creating big chances to reserve or protect more land. In the right places, where crops are no longer profitable, some amounts of money can acquire large amounts of land for nature.\nConservation groups also ought to attend more to the ecological disaster called biofuels.\nI encourage you to dig in on this paper and related work, which provides a useful guide for softening the human impact on a crowding planet. There\u2019ll be plenty of losses, and surprises, but there are real prospects for sustaining a thriving, and peopled, orb.\n6:57 p.m. | Addendum | For relevant work with somewhat different conclusions review the presentations from \u201cIntensifying agriculture within planetary boundaries,\u201d a session at the Planet Under Pressure conference in London last March.

{"text":"- published: 19 Mar 2013\n- views: 42\n- author: T.A. B\npossibly testing on weans, that worries me http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-us-canada-21849808.\nA vaccine is a biological preparation that improves immunity to a particular disease. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism, and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as foreign, destroy it, and \"remember\" it, so that the immune system can more easily recognize and destroy any of these microorganisms that it later encounters.\nVaccines can be prophylactic (example: to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future infection by any natural or \"wild\" pathogen), or therapeutic (e.g. vaccines against cancer are also being investigated; see cancer vaccine).\nThe term vaccine derives from Edward Jenner's 1796 use of cow pox (Latin variola vaccinia, adapted from the Latin vacc\u012bn-us, from vacca, cow), to inoculate humans, providing them protection against smallpox.\nVaccines do not guarantee complete protection from a disease. Sometimes, this is because the host's immune system simply does not respond adequately or at all. This may be due to a lowered immunity in general (diabetes, steroid use, HIV infection, age) or because the host's immune system does not have a B cell capable of generating antibodies to that antigen.\nEven if the host develops antibodies, the human immune system is not perfect and in any case the immune system might still not be able to defeat the infection immediately. In this case, the infection will be less severe and heal faster.\nAdjuvants are typically used to boost immune response. Most often aluminium adjuvants are used, but adjuvants like squalene are also used in some vaccines and more vaccines with squalene and phosphate adjuvants are being tested. Larger doses are used in some cases for older people (50\u201375 years and up), whose immune response to a given vaccine is not as strong.\nThe efficacy or performance of the vaccine is dependent on a number of factors:\nWhen a vaccinated individual does develop the disease vaccinated against, the disease is likely to be milder than without vaccination.\nThe following are important considerations in the effectiveness of a vaccination program:\nIn 1958 there were 763,094 cases of measles and 552 deaths in the United States. With the help of new vaccines, the number of cases dropped to fewer than 150 per year (median of 56). In early 2008, there were 64 suspected cases of measles. 54 out of 64 infections were associated with importation from another country, although only 13% were actually acquired outside of the United States; 63 of these 64 individuals either had never been vaccinated against measles, or were uncertain whether they had been vaccinated.\nVaccines are dead or inactivated organisms or purified products derived from them.\nThere are several types of vaccines in use. These represent different strategies used to try to reduce risk of illness, while retaining the ability to induce a beneficial immune response.\nSome vaccines contain killed, but previously virulent, micro-organisms that have been destroyed with chemicals, heat, radioactivity or antibiotics. Examples are the influenza vaccine, cholera vaccine, bubonic plague vaccine, polio vaccine, hepatitis A vaccine, and rabies vaccine.\nSome vaccines contain live, attenuated microorganisms. Many of these are live viruses that have been cultivated under conditions that disable their virulent properties, or which use closely related but less dangerous organisms to produce a broad immune response. Although most attenuated vaccines are viral, some are bacterial in nature. They typically provoke more durable immunological responses and are the preferred type for healthy adults. Examples include the viral diseases yellow fever, measles, rubella, and mumps and the bacterial disease typhoid. The live Mycobacterium tuberculosis vaccine developed by Calmette and Gu\u00e9rin is not made of a contagious strain, but contains a virulently modified strain called \"BCG\" used to elicit an immune response to the vaccine. The live attenuated vaccine containing strain Yersinia pestis EV is used for plague immunization. Attenuated vaccines have some advantages and disadvantages. They have the capacity of transient growth so they give prolonged protection, and no booster dose is required. But they may get reverted to the virulent form and cause the disease.\nToxoid vaccines are made from inactivated toxic compounds that cause illness rather than the micro-organism. Examples of toxoid-based vaccines include tetanus and diphtheria. Toxoid vaccines are known for their efficacy. Not all toxoids are for micro-organisms; for example, Crotalus atrox toxoid is used to vaccinate dogs against rattlesnake bites.\nProtein subunit \u2013 rather than introducing an inactivated or attenuated micro-organism to an immune system (which would constitute a \"whole-agent\" vaccine), a fragment of it can create an immune response. Examples include the subunit vaccine against Hepatitis B virus that is composed of only the surface proteins of the virus (previously extracted from the blood serum of chronically infected patients, but now produced by recombination of the viral genes into yeast), the virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV) that is composed of the viral major capsid protein, and the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subunits of the influenza virus. Subunit vaccine is being used for plague immunization.\nConjugate \u2013 certain bacteria have polysaccharide outer coats that are poorly immunogenic. By linking these outer coats to proteins (e.g. toxins), the immune system can be led to recognize the polysaccharide as if it were a protein antigen. This approach is used in the Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine.\nA number of innovative vaccines are also in development and in use:\nWhile most vaccines are created using inactivated or attenuated compounds from micro-organisms, synthetic vaccines are composed mainly or wholly of synthetic peptides, carbohydrates or antigens.\nVaccines may be monovalent (also called univalent) or multivalent (also called polyvalent). A monovalent vaccine is designed to immunize against a single antigen or single microorganism. A multivalent or polyvalent vaccine is designed to immunize against two or more strains of the same microorganism, or against two or more microorganisms. In certain cases a monovalent vaccine may be preferable for rapidly developing a strong immune response.\nThe immune system recognizes vaccine agents as foreign, destroys them, and \"remembers\" them. When the virulent version of an agent comes along the body recognizes the protein coat on the virus, and thus is prepared to respond, by (1) neutralizing the target agent before it can enter cells, and (2) by recognizing and destroying infected cells before that agent can multiply to vast numbers.\nWhen two or more vaccines are mixed together in the same formulation, the two vaccines can interfere. This most frequently occurs with live attenuated vaccines, where one of the vaccine components is more robust than the others and suppresses the growth and immune response to the other components. This phenomenon was first noted in the trivalent Sabin polio vaccine, where the amount of serotype 2 virus in the vaccine had to be reduced to stop it from interfering with the \"take\" of the serotype 1 and 3 viruses in the vaccine. This phenomenon has also been found to be a problem with the dengue vaccines currently being researched,[when?] where the DEN-3 serotype was found to predominate and suppress the response to DEN-1, -2 and -4 serotypes.\nVaccines have contributed to the eradication of smallpox, one of the most contagious and deadly diseases known to man. Other diseases such as rubella, polio, measles, mumps, chickenpox, and typhoid are nowhere near as common as they were a hundred years ago. As long as the vast majority of people are vaccinated, it is much more difficult for an outbreak of disease to occur, let alone spread. This effect is called herd immunity. Polio, which is transmitted only between humans, is targeted by an extensive eradication campaign that has seen endemic polio restricted to only parts of four countries (Afghanistan, India, Nigeria and Pakistan). The difficulty of reaching all children as well as cultural misunderstandings, however, have caused the anticipated eradication date to be missed several times.\nIn order to provide best protection, children are recommended to receive vaccinations as soon as their immune systems are sufficiently developed to respond to particular vaccines, with additional \"booster\" shots often required to achieve \"full immunity\". This has led to the development of complex vaccination schedules. In the United States, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which recommends schedule additions for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recommends routine vaccination of children against: hepatitis A, hepatitis B, polio, mumps, measles, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, HiB, chickenpox, rotavirus, influenza, meningococcal disease and pneumonia. The large number of vaccines and boosters recommended (up to 24 injections by age two) has led to problems with achieving full compliance. In order to combat declining compliance rates, various notification systems have been instituted and a number of combination injections are now marketed (e.g., Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and MMRV vaccine), which provide protection against multiple diseases.\nBesides recommendations for infant vaccinations and boosters, many specific vaccines are recommended at other ages or for repeated injections throughout life\u2014most commonly for measles, tetanus, influenza, and pneumonia. Pregnant women are often screened for continued resistance to rubella. The human papillomavirus vaccine is recommended in the U.S. (as of 2011) and UK (as of 2009). Vaccine recommendations for the elderly concentrate on pneumonia and influenza, which are more deadly to that group. In 2006, a vaccine was introduced against shingles, a disease caused by the chickenpox virus, which usually affects the elderly.\nSometime during the 1770s Edward Jenner heard a milkmaid boast that she would never have the often-fatal or disfiguring disease smallpox, because she had already had cowpox, which has a very mild effect in humans. In 1796, Jenner took pus from the hand of a milkmaid with cowpox, inoculated an 8-year-old boy with it, and six weeks later variolated the boy's arm with smallpox, afterwards observing that the boy did not catch smallpox. Further experimentation demonstrated the efficacy of the procedure on an infant. Since vaccination with cowpox was much safer than smallpox inoculation, the latter, though still widely practiced in England, was banned in 1840. Louis Pasteur generalized Jenner's idea by developing what he called a rabies vaccine, and in the nineteenth century vaccines were considered a matter of national prestige, and compulsory vaccination laws were passed.\nThe twentieth century saw the introduction of several successful vaccines, including those against diphtheria, measles, mumps, and rubella. Major achievements included the development of the polio vaccine in the 1950s and the eradication of smallpox during the 1960s and 1970s. Maurice Hilleman was the most prolific of the developers of the vaccines in the twentieth century. As vaccines became more common, many people began taking them for granted. However, vaccines remain elusive for many important diseases, including malaria and HIV.\n||The neutrality of this section is disputed. Please see the discussion on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until the dispute is resolved. (October 2011)|\n||This article is missing information about Scientific rebuttal to the attacks. This concern has been noted on the talk page where whether or not to include such information may be discussed. (October 2011)|\nOpposition to vaccination, from a wide array of vaccine critics, has existed since the earliest vaccination campaigns. Although the benefits of preventing suffering and death from serious infectious diseases greatly outweigh the risks of rare adverse effects following immunization, disputes have arisen over the morality, ethics, effectiveness, and safety of vaccination. Some vaccination critics say that vaccines are ineffective against disease or that vaccine safety studies are inadequate. Some religious groups do not allow vaccination, and some political groups oppose mandatory vaccination on the grounds of individual liberty. In response, concern has been raised that spreading unfounded information about the medical risks of vaccines increases rates of life-threatening infections, not only in the children whose parents refused vaccinations, but also in other children, perhaps too young for vaccines, who could contract infections from unvaccinated carriers (see herd immunity).\nOne challenge in vaccine development is economic: many of the diseases most demanding a vaccine, including HIV, malaria and tuberculosis, exist principally in poor countries. Pharmaceutical firms and biotechnology companies have little incentive to develop vaccines for these diseases, because there is little revenue potential. Even in more affluent countries, financial returns are usually minimal and the financial and other risks are great.\nMost vaccine development to date has relied on \"push\" funding by government, universities and non-profit organizations. Many vaccines have been highly cost effective and beneficial for public health. The number of vaccines actually administered has risen dramatically in recent decades.[when?] This increase, particularly in the number of different vaccines administered to children before entry into schools may be due to government mandates and support, rather than economic incentive.\nThe filing of patents on vaccine development processes can also be viewed as an obstacle to the development of new vaccines. Because of the weak protection offered through a patent on the final product, the protection of the innovation regarding vaccines is often made through the patent of processes used on the development of new vaccines as well as the protection of secrecy.\nVaccine production has several stages. First, the antigen itself is generated. Viruses are grown either on primary cells such as chicken eggs (e.g., for influenza), or on continuous cell lines such as cultured human cells (e.g., for hepatitis A). Bacteria are grown in bioreactors (e.g., Haemophilus influenzae type b). Alternatively, a recombinant protein derived from the viruses or bacteria can be generated in yeast, bacteria, or cell cultures. After the antigen is generated, it is isolated from the cells used to generate it. A virus may need to be inactivated, possibly with no further purification required. Recombinant proteins need many operations involving ultrafiltration and column chromatography. Finally, the vaccine is formulated by adding adjuvant, stabilizers, and preservatives as needed. The adjuvant enhances the immune response of the antigen, stabilizers increase the storage life, and preservatives allow the use of multidose vials. Combination vaccines are harder to develop and produce, because of potential incompatibilities and interactions among the antigens and other ingredients involved.\nVaccine production techniques are evolving. Cultured mammalian cells are expected to become increasingly important, compared to conventional options such as chicken eggs, due to greater productivity and low incidence of problems with contamination. Recombination technology that produces genetically detoxified vaccine is expected to grow in popularity for the production of bacterial vaccines that use toxoids. Combination vaccines are expected to reduce the quantities of antigens they contain, and thereby decrease undesirable interactions, by using pathogen-associated molecular patterns.\nIn 2010, India produced 60 percent of world's vaccine worth about $900 million.\nMany vaccines need preservatives to prevent serious adverse effects such as Staphylococcus infection that, in one 1928 incident, killed 12 of 21 children inoculated with a diphtheria vaccine that lacked a preservative. Several preservatives are available, including thiomersal, phenoxyethanol, and formaldehyde. Thiomersal is more effective against bacteria, has better shelf life, and improves vaccine stability, potency, and safety, but in the U.S., the European Union, and a few other affluent countries, it is no longer used as a preservative in childhood vaccines, as a precautionary measure due to its mercury content. Although controversial claims have been made that thiomersal contributes to autism, no convincing scientific evidence supports these claims.\nThere are several new delivery systems in development[when?] that will hopefully make vaccines more efficient to deliver. Possible methods include liposomes and ISCOM (immune stimulating complex).\nThe latest developments[when?] in vaccine delivery technologies have resulted in oral vaccines. A polio vaccine was developed and tested by volunteer vaccinations with no formal training; the results were positive in that the ease of the vaccines increased. With an oral vaccine, there is no risk of blood contamination. Oral vaccines are likely to be solid which have proven to be more stable and less likely to freeze; this stability reduces the need for a \"cold chain\": the resources required to keep vaccines within a restricted temperature range from the manufacturing stage to the point of administration, which, in turn, may decrease costs of vaccines. A microneedle approach, which is still in stages of development, uses \"pointed projections fabricated into arrays that can create vaccine delivery pathways through the skin\".\nA nanopatch is a needle free vaccine delivery system which is under development. A stamp-sized patch similar to an adhesive bandage contains about 20,000 microscopic projections per square inch. When worn on the skin, it will deliver vaccine directly to the skin, which has a higher concentration of immune cells than that in the muscles, where needles and syringes deliver. It thus increases the effectiveness of the vaccination using a lower amount of vaccine used in traditional syringe delivery system.\nThe use of plasmids has been validated in preclinical studies as a protective vaccine strategy for cancer and infectious diseases. However, in human studies this approach has failed to provide clinically relevant benefit. The overall efficacy of plasmid DNA immunization depends on increasing the plasmid's immunogenicity while also correcting for factors involved in the specific activation of immune effector cells.\nVaccinations of animals are used both to prevent their contracting diseases and to prevent transmission of disease to humans. Both animals kept as pets and animals raised as livestock are routinely vaccinated. In some instances, wild populations may be vaccinated. This is sometimes accomplished with vaccine-laced food spread in a disease-prone area and has been used to attempt to control rabies in raccoons.\nWhere rabies occurs, rabies vaccination of dogs may be required by law. Other canine vaccines include canine distemper, canine parvovirus, infectious canine hepatitis, adenovirus-2, leptospirosis, bordatella, canine parainfluenza virus, and Lyme disease among others.\nVaccine development has several trends:\nPrinciples that govern the immune response can now be used in tailor-made vaccines against many noninfectious human diseases, such as cancers and autoimmune disorders. For example, the experimental vaccine CYT006-AngQb has been investigated as a possible treatment for high blood pressure. Factors that have impact on the trends of vaccine development include progress in translatory medicine, demographics, regulatory science, political, cultural, and social responses.\n|Modern Vaccine and Adjuvant Production and Characterization, Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News|\nThe World News (WN) Network, has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to user privacy.

{"text":"China Service Medal\nThe China Service Medal was a relatively early entry into the hallowed halls of the medals of America when it was created by an Act of Congress in August of 1940. These US military medals were established to honor US Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard personnel who served ashore in China or were attached to vessels that operated in support of operations in China either between July 1937 and September of 1939, or between September of 1945 and April of 1957. Regulations permitted the wearing of a Bronze Service Star on these military medals and ribbons if a service member had performed duty during both periods of eligibility. These Navy medals are now considered obsolete, and are no longer issued by the US Navy. However, they can still be worn by Navy personnel who earned them during that period.\nThese Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps ribbons and medals are worn in the position directly below the Navy Expeditionary Medal, the Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal and the Coast Guard\u2019s Medal for Humane Action; and are worn directly above the National Defense Service Medal in the general order of precedence that has been established for the proper display of all Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard military ribbons and medals. The China Service Medal is generally available as Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard decorations in the form of military medals, ribbons, and lapel pins. They can be worn as traditional slide-on medals, mini medals, and ribbons. While traditionalist may still prefer to purchase the traditional slide-on full size military medals, mini-medals, and slide-on military ribbons; the newer thin mini-medals, and ultra thin military ribbons commercial suppliers now provide have become extremely popular among up and coming military personnel who know how important it is to their career advancement to always maximize the neatness and smartness of their uniform appearance.","id":"<urn:uuid:195f886c-5b11-4521-99b1-e67e4e0bd7be>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.mymilitarymedals.com\/shop\/product\/710FSM","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9771668315,"token_count":372,"score":2.59375,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Odd Wisconsin Archive\nToday marks the 25th anniversary of the first AIDS diagnosis, a gruesome fact but one which, like every other, has a historical context. Epidemics have swept through human communities for about 10,000 years, and Wisconsin has had its share.\nEuropean diseases probably reached Wisconsin before European explorers themselves. In the fifty years following Hernando de Soto's invasion of the lower Mississippi in 1539, disease killed 90 percent of the Indians living in the middle Mississippi Valley. These were Indians with whom Wisconsin peoples had traded for centuries, since at least the time of Aztalan. Many archaeologists have speculated that epidemics of measles or smallpox may have swept through Indian communities in Wisconsin decades before Jean Nicolet stepped ashore in 1634.\nOnce Europeans set up permanent settlements and native peoples gathered around them, disease penetrated Indian communities as effectively as metal pots, firearms, or porcelain beads. \u201cMaladies wrought among them more devastation than even war did,\u201d concluded contemporary French writer Bacqueville de la Potherie of the Wisconsin tribes, \u201cand exhalations from the rotting corpses caused great mortality.\u201d\nThe first clearly documented epidemic in Wisconsin was an act of bioterrorism perpetrated by British traders against Indians who had killed one of their colleagues. Dr. Douglass Houghton, who interviewed the Ojibwe about epidemics in 1832, wrote down their recollection that in 1770, when visiting Mackinac, \"a cask of liquor and a flag closely rolled were presented to the Indians as a token of friendship. They were at the same time strictly enjoined neither to break the seal of the cask nor to unroll the flag, until they had reached the heart of their own country.\n\"This they promised to observe; but while returning, and after having travelled many days, the chief of the deputation made a feast for the Indians of the band at Fond du Lac, Lake Superior, upon which occasion he unsealed the cask and unrolled the flag for the gratification of his guests... and of those Indians then at Fond du Lac, about three hundred in number, nearly the whole were swept off by it. Nor did it stop here; for numbers of those at Fond du Lac at the time the disease made its appearance, took refuge among the neighboring bands; and although it did not extend easterly on Lake Superior, it is believed that not a single band of Chippewas north or west from Fond du Lac escaped its ravages...\n\"The Indians at this day  are firmly of the opinion that the smallpox was at this time communicated through the articles presented to their brethren by the agent of the Fur Company at Mackinac; and that it was done for the purpose of punishing them more severely for their offences.\" His full account, including other outbreaks after this first one, is here. Houghton estimated that the disease had appeared among the Ojibwe at least five times in the previous 60 years.\nDisease is no respecter of race or ethnicity, and the earliest white settlers suffered catastrophically from epidemic outbreaks as well. At Fort Crawford in the summer of 1830, 154 of the 199 soldiers came down with malaria. Cholera broke out among them in August 1833, taking down 23 soldiers and killing six, and other outbreaks swept through the state between 1849 and 1854.\nIn August of 1895, smallpox swept through the southside of Milwaukee, where the traditions of recent Polish immigrants clashed with modern public health practices. The first patients were segregated at an isolation hospital outside the neighborhood, even though the residents preferred caring for their own sick in their own homes, as they had in the old country. When hospital patients began dying, the residents came to see the hospital as a slaughterhouse -- a place they would never send their loved ones. When city health officials or ambulances attempted to remove patients to protect the uninfected, they were met by barricaded doors and armed uprisings. A protest rally drew nearly 10,000 people to the hospital who stoned the police and fired pistols in the air. The 100 police officers plunged into the crowd swinging billy clubs, cracking heads and driving people back to their homes.\nThe Spanish Flu epidemic that followed World War I perhaps affected more Wisconsin residents than any other outbreak. Known variously as the \"Spanish Flu\" or \"La Grippe,\" influenza killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide. By the end of 1918, more than 675,000 Americans had died from the flu, most between the ages of 19 and 42, and the Wisconsin Board of Health declared that the \"Spanish flu\" epidemic would \"forever be remembered as the most disastrous calamity that has ever been visited upon the people of Wisconsin.\" The first cases were reported in southern Wisconsin in September 1918, and by December, influenza had sickened almost 103,000 residents and killed more than 8,000.
