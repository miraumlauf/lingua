{"text":"- Autonomy and freedom from bureaucratic rules\n- Choice for parents, so they can choose to leave schools that fail them and go to schools that they think will do better\n- A willingness to take risks\n- A willingness to close or replace innovations and charters that fail\nHere's what I think is the key passage:\nHow much risk and failure are we willing to tolerate to create much better schools for students who don\u2019t have them today? Or, put another way, if I told you there was a way to create 10 outstanding networks of schools for students who lack decent educational options now but that the cost of doing this would be the creation of four lousy networks of schools, would you take the deal?\nCritics of charter schools say this choice is a false one and that we should instead focus on improving existing schools. But their argument ignores the immediacy of educational failure. We\u2019re talking about communities where public schools are not failing just a little but where the catastrophe of broken lives unfolds every school year, places where less than half of high schoolers graduate and where fewer than one in ten students finish college by their mid-20s. And let\u2019s not forget, despite all the noise about turning around persistently failing schools, that successful turnarounds are like snow leopards \u2014 more mythical than actually observed.\nCharter proponents also disagree with the lose-some-to-win-some premise. Their main argument against it is that bad charters can be shut down. It\u2019s true that this does happen \u2014 government officials have refused to renew some charters \u2014 but it\u2019s proving to be more difficult in practice than in theory. There is an old saw in education that closing a school is like moving a cemetery: you get very little help from the inside. Charter parents and teachers often resist school closures just like their counterparts in the traditional system, and today there are not enough effective \u2014 read strong \u2014 charter school authorizers around the country.And I agree with that completely. If we want to achieve great success, the only way to figure out what works better is to try new approaches, and some of those approaches will not succeed--may even be worse than already exists. But the difference is the choice that parents have. Leaving just the monopoly system without real variety and choice for parents shackles students to a school and a system that has been mediocre or worse for decades. When charters fail, there are no shackles, and parents can freely leave to greener pastures.\nHowever, Utah also faces the same conundrum from the study noted above, namely that parents and school officials often resist the closure of a charter just like the same groups do at traditional schools. That makes it politically difficult to pull the closing trigger, and it's never actually happened in Utah.\nI'm a free-market guy who generally believes that if parents are satisfied enough to stay a a school, even if the bureaucracy or the government doesn't like it, we should give deference to what parents are choosing as the best option for their kid, even if the system thinks they shouldn't. Finding the balance between parental choice and public accountability is a tricky balance.\nSo, I suggest that Utah needs the following:\n- Expansion of charter schools, particularly successful charter schools, so that parents' choices are not limited by mile-long waiting lists;\n- School districts that embrace innovation, relying less on boundaries, and that really empower schools to innovate and achieve--along with the inherent risks that come with allowing parents to choose to leave;\n- A realistic mechanism to close or replace failing schools, both traditional and charter, including making it easier to convert a traditional school to a charter (the state Charter Board has made progress in this area, but I believe they also need an enrollment trigger);\n- Real freedom in schools to allow for the variety that gives families real choices, including freedom in whom they hire, what they teach (let a school decide that more time teaching reading is more important than teaching how to use laundry detergent), and how they spend money;\n- No fear to try something and fail.","id":"<urn:uuid:3d4aca0c-2f3b-4877-8585-8d13ef2cc1c6>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/charterscool.blogspot.com\/2011\/11\/charter-school-lemons.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9705079794,"token_count":841,"score":2.984375,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Our opinion on ...\n- Executive Summary\n- Necessity for a response\n- Genetic testing\n- General principles\n- Other considerations\nThe present paper constitutes the input of Alzheimer Europe and its member organisations to the ongoing discussions within Europe about genetic testing (in the context of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia).\nAlzheimer Europe would like to recall some general principles which guide this present response:\n- Having a gene associated with Alzheimer's disease or another form of dementia does not mean that a person has the disease.\n- People who have a gene linked to Alzheimer's disease or another form of dementia have the same rights as anyone else.\n- Genetic testing does not only affect the person taking the test. It may also reveal information about other relatives who might not want to know.\n- No genetic test is 100% accurate.\n- The extent to which health cover is provided to citizens by the State social security system and\/or privately contracted by individuals differs from one country to the next.\nOn the basis of these principles, Alzheimer Europe has developed the following position with regard to genetic testing:\n- Alzheimer Europe firmly believes that the use and\/or possession of genetic information by insurance companies should be prohibited.\n- Alzheimer Europe strongly supports research into the genetic factors linked to dementia which might further our understanding of the cause and development of the disease and possibly contribute to future treatment.\n- Based on its current information, Alzheimer Europe does not encourage the use of any genetic test for dementia UNLESS such test has a high and proven success rate either in assessing the risk of developing the disease (or not as the case may be) or in detecting the existence of it in a particular individual.\n- Alzheimer Europe requests further information on the accuracy, reliability and predictive value of any genetic tests for dementia.\n- Genetic testing should always be accompanied by adequate pre- and post-test counselling.\n- Anonymous testing should be possible so that individuals can ensure that such information does not remain in their medical files against their will.\nIt is extremely important for people with dementia to be diagnosed as soon as possible. In the case of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, an early diagnosis may enable the person concerned to benefit from medication, which treats the global symptoms of the disease and is most effective in the early to mid stages of the disease. Most forms of dementia involve the gradual deterioration of mental faculties (e.g. memory, language and thinking etc.) but in the early stages, it is still possible for the person affected to make decisions concerning his\/her finances and care etc. \u2013 hence the importance of an early diagnosis.\nIf it were possible to detect dementia before the first symptoms became obvious, this would give people a greater opportunity to make informed decisions about their future lives. This is one of the potential benefits of genetic testing.\nOn the other hand, such information could clearly be used in ways which would be contrary to their personal interests, perhaps resulting in employment discrimination, loss of opportunities, stigmatisation, increased health insurance costs or even loss of health insurance to name but a few examples.\nThe present discussion paper outlines some of the recommendations of Alzheimer Europe and its member organisations and raises a few points which deserve further clarification and discussion.\nThe necessity for a response by Alzheimer Europe\nIn the last few years, the issue of genetic testing has been increasingly debated. In certain European countries there are already companies offering such tests. Unfortunately, the general public do not always fully understand what the results of such tests imply and there are no regulations governing how they are carried out i.e. what kind of information people receive, how the results are presented, whether there is any kind of counselling afterwards and the issue of confidentiality etc.\nIn order to provide information to people with dementia and other people interesting in knowing about their own state of health and in order to protect them from the unscrupulous use of the results of genetic tests, Alzheimer Europe has developed the present Position Paper.\nThese general principles as well as the Convention of Human Rights and Biomedicine and the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights dictate Alzheimer Europe\u2019s position with regard to genetic testing.\nAlzheimer Europe would like to draw a distinction between tests which detect existing Alzheimer's disease and tests which assess the risk of developing dementia Alzheimer's disease at some time in the future:\n- Diagnostic testing : Familial early onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease (FAD) is associated with 3 genes. These are the amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1 and presenilin-2. These genetic mutations can be detected by genetic testing. However, it is important to note that the test only relates to those people with FAD (i.e. about 1% of all people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease). In the extremely limited number of families with this dominant genetic disorder, family members inherit from one of their parents the part of the DNA (the genetic make-up), which causes the disease. On average, half the children of an affected parent will develop the disease. For those who do, the age of onset tends to be relatively low, usually between 35 and 60.\n- Assessment for risk testing : Whether or not members of one\u2019s family have Alzheimer\u2019s disease, everyone risks developing the disease at some time. However, it is now known that there is a gene, which can affect this risk. This gene is found on chromosome 19 and it is responsible for the production of a protein called apolipoprotein E (ApoE). There are three main types of this protein, one of which (ApoE4), although uncommon, makes it more likely that Alzheimer\u2019s disease will occur. However, it does not cause the disease, but merely increases the likelihood. For example, a person of 50, would have a 2 in 1,000 chance of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease instead of the usual 1 in 1,000, but might never actually develop it. Only 50% of people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease have ApoE4 and not everyone with ApoE4 suffers from it.\nThere is no way to accurately predict whether a particular person will develop the disease. It is possible to test for the ApoE4 gene mentioned above, but strictly speaking such a test does not predict whether a particular person will develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease or not. It merely indicates that he or she is at greater risk. There are in fact people who have had the ApoE4 gene, lived well into old age and never developed Alzheimer\u2019s disease, just as there are people who did not have ApoE4, who did develop the disease. Therefore taking such a test carries the risk of unduly alarming or comforting somebody.\nAlzheimer Europe agrees with diagnostic genetic testing provided that pre- and post-test counselling is provided, including a full discussion of the implications of the test and that the results remain confidential.\nWe do not actually encourage the use of genetic testing for assessing the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. We feel that it is somewhat unethical as it does not entail any health benefit and the results cannot actually predict whether a person will develop dementia (irrespective of the particular form of ApoE s\/he may have).\nWe are totally opposed to insurance companies having access to results from genetic tests for the following reasons:\n- This would be in clear opposition to the fundamental principle of insurance which is the mutualisation of risk through large numbers (a kind of solidarity whereby the vast majority who have relatively good health share the cost with those who are less fortunate).\n- Failure to respect this principle would create an uninsurable underclass and lead to a genetically inferior group.\n- This in turn could entail the further stigmatisation of people with dementia and their carers.\n- In some countries, insurance companies manage to reach decisions on risk and coverage without access to genetic data.\n- We therefore urge governments and the relevant European bodies to take the necessary action to prohibit the use or possession of genetic data by insurance companies.\nAlzheimer Europe recognises the importance of research into the genetic determinants of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia. Consequently,\n- we support the use of genetic testing for the purposes of research provided that the person concerned has given informed consent and that the data is treated with utmost confidentiality; and\n- we would also welcome further discussion about the problem of data management.\nIn our opinion, any individual who wishes to take a genetic test should be able to choose to do so anonymously in order to ensure that such information does not remain in his\/her medical file.\nAt its Annual General Meeting in Munich on 15 October 2000, Alzheimer Europe adopted recommendations on how to improve the legal rights and protection of adults with incapacity due to dementia. This included a section on bioethical issues. These recommendations obviously need to guide any response of the organisation regarding genetic testing for people who suspect or fear they may have dementia and also those who have taken the test and did develop dementia.\n- The adult with incapacity has the right to be informed about his\/her state of health.\n- Information should, where appropriate, cover the following: the diagnosis, the person's general state of health, treatment possibilities, potential risks and consequences of having or not having a particular treatment, side-effects, prognosis and alternative treatments.\n- Such information should not be withheld solely on the grounds that the adult is suffering from dementia and\/or has communication difficulties. Attempts should be made to provide information in such a way as to maximise his\/her ability to understand, making use of technology and other available techniques to enhance communication. Attention should be paid to any possible difficulty understanding, retaining information and communicating, as well as his\/her level of education, reasoning capacity and cultural background. Care should be taken to avoid causing unnecessary anxiety and suffering.\n- Written as well as verbal information should always be provided as a back-up. The adult should be granted access to his\/her medical file(s). S\/he should also have the opportunity to discuss the contents of the medical file(s) with a person of his\/her choice (e.g. a doctor) and\/or to appoint someone to receive information on his\/her behalf.\n- Information should not be given against the will of the adult with incapacity.\n- The confidentiality of information should extend beyond the lifetime of the adult with incapacity. If any information is used for research or statistical purposes, the identity of the adult with incapacity should remain anonymous and the information should not be traceable back to him\/her (in accordance with the provisions of national laws on respect for the confidentiality of personal information). Consideration should be given to access to information where abuse is suspected.\n- A clear refusal by the adult with incapacity to grant access to information to any third party should be respected regardless of the extent of his\/her incapacity, unless this would be clearly against his\/her best interests e.g. carers should have provided to them information on a need to know basis to enable them to care effectively for the adult with incapacity.\n- People who receive information about an adult with incapacity in connection with their work (either voluntary or paid) should be obliged to treat such information with confidentiality.\nPeople who take genetic tests and do not receive adequate pre and post test counselling may suffer adverse effects.\nFear of discrimination based on genetic information may deter people from taking genetic tests which could be useful for research into the role of genes in the development of dementia.\nCertain tests may be relevant for more than one medical condition. For example, the ApoE test is used in certain countries as part of the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease. There is therefore a risk that a person might consent for one type of medical test and have the results used for a different reason.\nLast Updated: jeudi 06 ao\u00fbt 2009","id":"<urn:uuid:62210bfc-b709-4c59-93ac-36ec9784506d>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.alzheimer-europe.org\/FR%C5%A0%C2%B7%C5%A0%20\/Policy-in-Practice2\/Our-opinion-on\/Genetic-testing","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9431832433,"token_count":2443,"score":2.625,"int_score":3}
{"text":"I\u2019ve seen several articles debating when oil production will peak. For those of you who have missed them, oil prices rise due to scarcity (real or not) or increased production costs, and the latter become important sometime around when oil production peaks. Also, the time for us to go through the second half of the world\u2019s oil will be considerably less than the history of oil use to date, and our transportation infrastructure in particular is heavily oil-based.\nAmong climate change scientists, there seems to be less worry about running out of oil, and considerably more worry about its use. Recent readings have given me some understanding.\nDavid Greene, et al, from (pdf file) Running Out of and into Oil: Analyzing Global Oil Depletion and Transition Through 2050\n\u201cIt is possible that the world could go partway down the path of developing unconventional oil resources and later reverse direction. But such a strategy would strand huge investments in the more capital-intensive production and refining of unconventional oil. If the transition to unconventional oil is gradual, there might be time to introduce low-carbon alternatives and a reversal might not be too costly. But if the transition to unconventional oil is sudden and massive, the world\u2019s economies might quickly become locked into a high carbon future. Avoiding or even slowing the transition to unconventional fossil resources might improve the world\u2019s chances of successfully dealing with global climate change.\u201d\nThe unconventional oil sources referred to are coal to liquids (synfuel), for example, or natural gas to liquids (isn\u2019t all natural gas needed for electricity and heating?) Both increase carbon emissions, in part because of the energy needed to convert them to liquid. Both are expensive because they require so much energy for the process.\nOil prices will rise if we hit a peak, but Europeans and others are already living with much higher gasoline prices.\nDetour: A vote on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is expected soon. My understanding is that oil companies are not particularly interested in drilling there without some kind of guarantee (a large guarantee, but will that dissuade Congress?), as there is relatively little oil, and it\u2019s relatively far from where it would be used. I\u2019m not sure why anyone would vote for opening up the site to oil drilling, both for practical reasons and because it\u2019s nice to imagine those few places in the world not crowded by us. What I hear is, \u201cgot you, you crummy environmentalists\u201d, but perhaps our legislators have other reasons, poorly articulated to date. Certainly these reasons have little to do with oil security, even for the rare person who also votes to increase car mileage standards. That said, the overwhelming concern to the caribou is not the drilling, but the use of oil. Climate change alters the environment at high altitudes faster, and refuge status will not protect ANWR.\nReturn: From my reading, it is apparent that the rest of the world, as non-OPEC is generally referred to, is running out of oil much faster than is OPEC. Fareed Zakaria in The Future of Freedom: Illiberal Democracy at Home and Abroad points out that governments that finance themselves without taxes are not as accountable to citizens. Hence there is worldwide discomfort at financing these governments. But the discomfort is not great enough here in the United States to taxing oil in order to encourage us to change our behavior.\nWe would be much better off raising taxes on oil use today. Even a moderate tax, perhaps as little as $1\/gallon, will begin to shift behavior, to help stretch out our current oil supply and allow the transitions away from fossil fuels, so that we don\u2019t finance OPEC governments so heavily.\nOh, I\u2019ve heard many, particularly poor people, say, but we can\u2019t afford it. Perhaps more earned income credit, or some other mechanism, could help the poor in this transition, and let people choose whether to spend the extra money on a car or the bus. It isn\u2019t right to ignore those who will be hurt in a transition. But we are wrong if we do not transition. Some talk about making the carbon tax revenue neutral, an idea I was more sympathetic to until the Bush deficits, and back when I thought roads and bridges are paid for by the current gasoline tax rather than out of general revenue.\nWe could do more regional planning of mass transit systems. We could use some of the gasoline tax to pay for the roads and mass transit that makes our roads less crowded. We could teach bicycling as a PE option, as those who learn to bicycle and signal correctly are less dangerous to themselves and others and are more likely to continue bicycling as adults. This would leave more oil for those of you who can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to bicycle. There\u2019s lots we can do.\nThe cost of our transportation continues to increase. The obvious increases in price are accompanied by the continued power of corrupt governments, the costs to agriculture and water supplies and human settlements and peace from climate change. Let\u2019s add some of these costs, or the desire to avoid these costs, to the price of gasoline. The costs will be paid, either as lower costs consciously assumed today or higher costs imposed tomorrow.","id":"<urn:uuid:1f33fe76-fd4e-4211-8d6f-f209603fa1a6>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/pathsoflight.us\/musing\/2005\/03\/peak-oil\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9627709985,"token_count":1084,"score":2.828125,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Taking a sample is just the beginning and preserving and processing specimens requires more than just the e-word.\nHaving completed eight dives, at least sixteen shore excursions, one nightlighting session, six trips to the fish markets, several roadside purchases and a surprise swim up to a fishing boat, the scientists have well and truly justified that purchase of 90 litres of ethanol on Day 1.\nOn each trip the preserving began in the field and continued back at our accommodation. The specimens will soon be shipped to the Museum where a thorough analysis can be performed, possibly including SEM photography and DNA sequencing. After that, identifications can be confirmed if necessary and scientific papers can be published.\nSo how did the scientists start to process their samples here in Timor? I spoke with about half the team to find out (because talking to all of them would've made this post longer than a Dead Sea scroll).\nLauren studies amphipods, an order of crustaceans, and was picking samples from dive sites (and one nightlighting session) with these small (usually less then 10mm) creatures in mind. She uses the freshwater dip method which means placing her substrate samples in a bucket of tap water as it encourages saltwater animals to release from their holds.\nLauren then elutriated (swirled) the bucket, causing the heavier sediment to fall to the bottom and the lighter amphipods to rise to the top. The swirling water was slowly tipped out into a sieve. What was filtered out was then placed in a tray and examined for animals, which were picked up with forceps or pipettes and placed into jars of ethanol. After that, the habitat samples that remained in the bucket were also placed in the tray and similarly examined for fauna.\nWe had a team of five fish scientists (dubbed \u2018the fishos\u2019) on this trip who worked together to process their samples and make strange, bawdy jokes whenever possible. While they did collect samples at the fish markets, the vast majority of their specimens were taken on dives and kept in plastic bags of seawater (in eskies) until they returned to camp.\nHijacking the dinner table for hours at a time, their processing often looked and sounded like question time at Parliament, but on closer examination was actually a highly organised and efficient affair. Their processing started with placing the fishes into trays and tubs of ice, dividing the day\u2019s catch roughly by type.\nFrom there the team began to identify the fishes, with each member focussing on those species they specialise in: Barry covered the wrasses, for example, and Jeff the cardinal fishes. They would often check with each other, however, and consult the stack of reference books they brought with them.\nOnce a fish was named it would go to Mark for photographing, sometimes having their fins pinned out if they had distinctive colours. Sally was the chief scribe during all of this, recording names, sizes and number of specimens, as well as writing small labels for Mark to photograph with the fishes.\nIf a fish was identified as one that hadn't been previously collected on the trip, then it would go to Amanda who would extract a small piece of muscle tissue with a scalpel and place it into a vial of DMSO solution (which is conducive to DNA analysis). The rest of the fish would be placed in formalin.\nPenny came on this trip to collect crustaceans and fishes and was involved in the processing of invertebrate samples. Like Lauren, Penny did most of her sorting in a tray, but her samples remained in saltwater until they were picked out and placed in jars of ethanol.\nFrom experience she was able to remove large pieces of reef rock from the tray that were unlikely to contain animals (those that shake \u2018clean\u2019 in the water for example) and make use of chisels to break down the likely ones (those with cracks and crevices).\nNerida and Greg frequently collected sediment from the ocean floor, elutriating at the back of the boat and transferring the filtered portion to plastic bags. Back at their makeshift lab they would examine this remainder in dishes under the microscope, looking for sea slugs and similar animals not much bigger than the grains of sediment they move between.\nThe process involved multiple dishes and frequent changing and cleaning of the seawater to make it easier to observe these microscopic animals. At the end of the process they would have a collection of specimens and would decide then which ones to process further. These would be photographed while still alive and depending on their size, have either a subsample taken for DNA analysis (and placed in a vial of ethanol) or be placed whole in ethanol or formalin.\nRosemary searched for tiny sea snails in mangrove and intertidal zones in Timor, collecting samples of mud, leaf matter and debris which she would \u2018coarsely wash\u2019 in the field using a very fine sieve. Keeping these samples cool in a bucket, she would return to the lab and use a spoon to scoop this \u2018washed off\u2019 matter into a petri dish.\nThe contents of the dish were swirled around so that it would settle into one layer, making it easier to see crawling animals or shapes that she recognises. She placed her specimens in ethanol for photographing and DNA sequencing back at the Museum.\nMandy surveyed the dive sites, markets and random fishing boats for cephalopods (octopuses, squid and cuttlefish). Back at the hotel, she would photograph each specimen and take two tissue samples: one muscle and one from the gills.\nThese samples would be placed in separate vials of ethanol. Later, the ethanol will be poured off and the samples added to our frozen tissue collection at the Museum and made available for DNA analysis.\nThe remainder of the specimens she acquired were fixed in formalin, with the beaks and radulas of the squid and the cuttlebones of the cuttlefish being detached beforehand (yes, squid have beaks). These will eventually be transferred to 70% ethanol, given a number in our database and added to our collection for long term storage.","id":"<urn:uuid:81d6fb10-6b67-4af1-9eb5-b3504291e57d>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.australianmuseum.net.au\/BlogPost\/Science\/It-Started-With-A-Catch-Timor-Leste-Expedition","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9751482606,"token_count":1274,"score":2.828125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"INDO-CHINA: The New Frontier\nTIME. Monday, May. 29, 1950\nThe U.S. now has a new frontier and a new ally in the cold war. The place is Indo-China, a Southeast Asian jungle, mountain and delta land that includes the Republic of Viet Nam and the smaller neighboring Kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia, all parts of the French Union.\nFor more than three years this land, in prewar times the rich French colony of Indo-China, has been suffering, on a lesser scale, the ruinous kind of civil war which won China for Communism. The Mao Tse-tung of the Indo-Chinese is a frail, but enduring comrade, who looks like a shriveled wizard; his nom de guerre is Ho Chi Minh (or One Who Shines). Chiang Kai-shek has no counterpart in Indo-China. The initial brunt of the Red attack has been borne by French soldiers. Meanwhile, the job of rallying native anti-Communist forces falls mainly on the meaty shoulders of the Emperor Bao Dai (or Guardian of Greatness), who now bears the official title of Chief of State of Viet Nam.\nWhile the dust of the Chinese civil war was settling before the bemused eyes of the State Department, the U.S. paid scant attention to the Indo-Chinese struggle. It seemed largely a local affair between the French and their subjects. Since the dust has settled in China, Asia\u2019s Communism is thrusting southward. Indo-China stands first on the path to Singapore, Manila and the Indies (see map).\nLast January, led by Peking and Moscow, the world\u2019s Communist bloc recognized Ho Chi Minh\u2019s \u201cDemocratic Republic.\u201d It was more than the Kremlin had ever done for the Communist rebels of Greece. Over the past several weeks, arms and other supplies were reported passing from Russia and China to the comrades in Indo-China. The stakes in Southeast Asia were big\u2014as big as the global struggle between Communism and freedom.\nA fortnight ago in Paris, U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson drew a line in the dust that has so long beclouded U.S. diplomacy. He implicitly recognized that the war in Indo-China is no local shooting match. He pledged U.S. military and economic aid to the French and Vietnamese. The U.S. thus picked up the Russian gauntlet.\nWhat kind of frontier and what kind of ally had history chosen for the U.S.?\nA Golden Asset. Unlike China, where U.S. traders and missionaries began a fruitful acquaintance more than a century ago, Indo-China has had little contact with Americans, either commercial, cultural or diplomatic.* The last comprehensive U.S. book on the country was published in 1937. Among other things, its author observed: \u201cIndoChina lies too far off the main scene of action to play any but a secondary role in the Pacific drama.\u201d\nIn the pre-French past, most of Indo-China had been conquered by the Chinese, who had left their culture indelibly behind.\u2020 Through the last half of the 19th. Century, the French converted Indo-China into a tight, profitable colonial monopoly. They explored its fever-laden jungles, lofty ranges, great river valleys. They discovered its antiquities, including the majestic loth Century towers of Angkor Wat in northern Cambodia. They wrote about its mandarins, its Buddhist temples and Confucian family life.\nThe French invested $2 billion, built up Indo-China\u2019s rice and rubber production; before World War II, the colony, along with Siam and Burma, was one of the world\u2019s three leading rice exporters. Its surplus went to rice-short China, a fact of great significance these days in Communist China\u2019s support of Communist Ho Chi Minh. All the raw rubber France needed came from Indo-China. There were other lucrative items: coal, wolfram, pepper, opium (which, to French shame, was sold to the natives through a state monopoly) and many jobs for a white bureaucracy. French politicians called the colony \u201cour marvelous balcony on the Pacific.\u201d\nA Dangerous Liability. Indo-China is no longer a golden asset for France. As everywhere in the East, the old colonialism has died beneath the impact of Western nationalist, egalitarian ideas, a process greatly hastened by the Japanese march in World War II under the slogan \u201cAsia for the Asiatics.\u201d The French have bowed grudgingly to the times.\nIn an agreement signed March 8, 1949 with Bao Dai, they promised limited freedom for Viet Nam within the French Union. Under its terms, a Viet Nam cabinet has charge of internal affairs, the right to a national army. Paris keeps direct control of foreign policy, maintains military bases and special courts for Frenchmen, retains a special place for French advisers and the French language.\nBy that time the French were up to their necks in a costly campaign to crush Ho Chi Minh and his Communist bid for power. The civil war has cut rice production in half and disrupted the rest of Indo-China\u2019s economy. It has tied down 130,000 French troops, about half of the Fourth Republic\u2019s army, and thereby weakened the contribution France might make to Western Europe\u2019s defense. In lives, the Indo-China war has cost the French 50,000 casualties. In money, it has cost $2 billion\u2014just about the sum of ECAid to France.\nIndo-China, in brief, has become a dangerous liability for France\u2014 nor does any realistic Frenchman think it can ever again be an asset. Why, therefore, spend more blood and treasure in thankless jungle strife? Why not pull out?\nThe answer is: more than French war weariness and prestige are at stake. If Indo-China falls to Communism, so, in all probability\u201d, will all of Southeast Asia.\nFor U.S. citizens, the first fact about their new frontier is that it will cost money to hold\u2014much more than the French can pay alone, much more than the $15 million in arms and $23 million in economic aid thus far promised by Washington. The second fact is more compelling : the new frontier, if it is not to crumble, may need U.S. troops as well as French.\nOtherwise, the U.S. might surfer another catastrophic defeat in the Far East.\nA Question of Sympathy. The French have made more than the usual colonial mistakes. All too often, especially since they put the Foreign Legion and its German mercenaries to the work of restoring order after World War II, they have been arrogant and brutal toward the Indo-Chinese. They are paying for it now, for the bulk of Communist Ho Chi Minh\u2019s support comes from anti- French, or anti-colonial Indo-Chinese. A sign over an Indo-Chinese village street tells the story; it reads \u201cCommunism, No. Colonialism, Never.\u201d\nBut the issue of native sympathy is complex. The vast majority of the people are simple rice farmers, who want peace and order so they may tend their paddy-fields. Ho Chi Minh himself does not now preach Communism openly: his explanation is that his people have no understanding of the word. Besides a crude, hate-the-French appeal (including atrocity propaganda\u2014see cut), he has another effective persuasion: terror. His guerrillas and underground operators stalk the countryside; his assassins and bomb-throwers terrorize the cities. Indefatigably he spreads the word that he is winning, as his comrades have won in China.\nThe result is that many are cowed into helping him, or at least staying out of the anti-Communist effort. Others, especially among the intelligentsia, sit on the fence, waiting to jump on the winning side. This is where Bao Dai comes in.\nA Display of Strength. It is Bao Dai\u2019s mission, and the U.S.-French hope, to rally his countrymen to the anti-Communist camp of the West. In this undertaking he needs time. \u201cNothing can be done overnight,\u201d he says. He needs time to organize an effective native government, train an army and militia that can restore order in the villages, win over the doubting fence-sitters among the intelligentsia. Besides a military shield, he also needs a display of winning strength and patient understanding by his Western allies.\nAs a national leader, Bao Dai has his weaknesses, and largely because of them he does not enjoy the kind of popularity achieved by India\u2019s Jawaharlal Nehru. But, as the lineal heir of the old monarchs of Annam, he is his nation\u2019s traditional \u201cfather & mother,\u201d its first priest (Buddhist) and judge. The French say that Bao Dai should act more decisively; whenever he does, there is impressive popular response.\nNehru\u2019s government of India, trailed by Burma\u2019s Thakin Nu, Indonesia\u2019s Soekarno and even by the Philippines\u2019 Elpidio Quirino, has so far refused to follow the major Western democracies in recognizing Bao Dai\u2019s Viet Nam Republic. They look on him as a French puppet. But Bao Dai has shown a judgment on the crucial ideological conflict of his time that compares strikingly and favorably with the petulant, third-force position of Pandit Nehru.\nRecently, for example, Bao Dai told a TIME correspondent about his impressions of Ho Chi Minh in 1946, when both leaders were cooperating with the French to establish a new Viet Nam regime.\n\u201cAt first,\u201d recalled Bao Dai, \u201cwe all believed the Ho government was really a nationalistic regime . . . I called Ho \u2018Elder Brother\u2019 and he called me \u2018Younger Brother.\u2019 . . .\n\u201cThen, I saw he was fighting a battle within himself. He realized that Communism was not best for our country. But it was too late. He could not overcome his own allegiance to Communism.\u201d\nA Royal Notion. Bao Dai is essentially a product of the old French colonialism\u2014the best of it thwarted by some of the worst.\nBorn in 1913, the only son of the ailing Emperor Khai Dinh, he studied under Chinese tutors until nine. Then his father\u2019s French advisers decided he should go to France for a Western education.\nThe emperor put on a parasol-shaped red velvet hat and a golden-dragon robe, accompanied his son on the first trip abroad for any of their dynasty. In Paris he put the prince under the tutelage of former Annam Governor Eugene Charles. \u201cI bring you a schoolboy,\u201d said Khai Dinh. \u201cMake of him what you will.\u201d Three years later, Khai Dinh died. He was buried in a splendid mausoleum, at Hu\u00e9; at the foot of his tomb lay his prized French decorations, toothbrush, Thermos bottles and \u201cBig Ben\u201d alarm clock. Bao Dai, who had come \u2018home for the funeral, was crowned the 13th sovereign of the Nguyen (pronounced New Inn) dynasty. He turned the throne over to a regent, and hurried back to Paris.\nThe young Emperor continued his Chinese lessons, studied Annamite chronicles, browsed through French history, literature and economics. He was especially fond of books on Henry IV, the dynast from Navarre who began the Bourbon rule in France with the cynical remark, \u201cParis is worth a Mass,\u201d and the demagogic slogan, \u201cEvery family should have a fowl in the pot on Sunday.\u201d Bao Dai put his money in Swiss banks (and thereby saved it from World War II\u2019s reverses), collected stamps, practiced tennis with Champion Henri Cochet, learned ping-pong, dressed in tweeds and flannels, vacationed in the Pyrenees, scented himself heavily with Coty and Chanel perfumes.\nUp to this point the Emperor had absorbed a good deal of the education of an intelligent, progressive French adolescent. He had high notions of applying what he had learned back home.\nIn 1932, at 19, Bao Dai formally took over the Dragon Throne at Hu\u00e9; two years later he married beautiful Mariette-Jeanne Nguyen Huu Thi Lan, the daughter of a wealthy Cochin-Chinese merchant. The Empress Nam Phuong was a Roman Catholic, educated at Paris\u2019 Convent \u201cAux Oiseaux.\u201d\nBao Dai reigned but he did not rule. The French (Third Republic and Vichy) shrugged off his earnest pleas for social and economic reforms and more native political autonomy. Cleverly, as they thought, they encouraged the Emperor to devote himself to sport and pleasure.\nBao Dai was hunting tigers near his summer villa at Dalat when the Japanese, early in 1945, made their 1940 control of the colony official and complete. They surprised his party, took him prisoner, installed him as a puppet emperor\u2014until their own capitulation to the Allies a few months later.\nAgitator Ho. At this point, the lines of Bao Dai\u2019s destiny first crossed those of his fellow Annamite Ho Chi Minh.\nThe two men made a dramatic contrast. The Emperor was young (then 32), plump, clean-shaven, bland-faced, fond of snappy Western sport clothes. Ho was aging (55), slight (hardly 5 ft. tall), goat-bearded, steelyeyed, usually seen in a frayed khaki tunic and cloth slippers. Ho Chi Minh, too, had gone to France for education. As a young man, he had been sent into exile by the French police of Indo-China because of his family\u2019s nationalist agitation. His father and a brother went to political prison for life. A sister received nine years of hard labor.\nIn Paris, Ho (then known as Nguyen Ai Quoc) became a photographer\u2019s assistant, wrote anti-imperialist articles. He also joined the French Communist Party. He was sent to Moscow for training, became a Comintern functionary, re-emerged in 1925 at Canton, where he helped Russian Agent Borodin in Communism\u2019s first attempt to seize China.\nFrom Hong Kong in 1931 Ho Chi Minh organized the first Indo-Chinese Communist Party. The British clapped him into jail for a year. When he came out, he continued organizing Red cells in his country. Japan and World War II gave him his big chance.\nUsing popular front-tactics, Ho established the Viet Minh\u2014League for the Independence of Viet Nam. It directed guerrilla war against both Vichy French and Japanese, enlisted the support of many Indo-Chinese nationalists. American OSS agents and arms were parachuted to Ho\u2019s side.\n\u201cUncle Ho.\u201d By the time the French were ready to pick up the postwar strings again in Indo-China, Communist Ho was very much a popular hero, better known as \u201cUncle Ho.\u201d He spoke a \u201csoft\u201d Communist line, talked more about freedom, democracy and reform. Bao Dai was in a different position. He had suffered in reputation because he had \u201cgotten along\u201d with Vichy French and Japanese.\nThe returning French began negotiations with the Viet Minh leader. There were polite hints that Bao Dai must go\u2014he was too \u201cunpopular.\u201d Bao abdicated, and Ho was in the saddle.\nBao Dai stayed on in Indo-China for a while, as plain citizen Nguyen Vinh Thuy and Honorary Councilor to the Republic. Nobody had much use for him. He went abroad and flung himself into a reckless round of pleasure and sport.\nPlayboy. Most of his time he spent at Cannes, on the French Riviera, where he had bought the palatial Ch\u00e2teau de Thorenc (reported purchase price: $250,000). In his garage were a pale blue Lincoln convertible, a black Citroen limousine, a blue Simca \u201cGordoni\u201d one-seat racer, a sleek Italian two-seater, a Simca-8 sports model. He also kept several motorcycles. He insisted that every engine run \u201cas accurately as a watch.\u201d\nHe dallied in the bars and casinos, chain-smoked cheap Gauloise cigarettes, treated hangers-on to champagne and caviar, played roulette for 10,000-franc chips (\u201cHis Majesty\u2019s losses,\u201d remarked a croupier, \u201cbefitted his rank\u201d), sometimes conducted jazz bands, sent his secretary to open negotiations with the many women who caught his eye. (\u201cMy grandfather had 125 wives and 300 children,\u201d Bao Dai once remarked to a journalist. \u201cI have a few mistresses. What then?\u201d) He played golf capably and bridge like a master. A crack shot with rifle or revolver, he often arranged target competitions with the ch\u00e2teau\u2019s servants.\nMeanwhile the French, back in Indo-China, had broken with Ho Chi Minh, were floundering in a Communist-led nationalist uprising. They appealed to Bao Dai to come home again and help rally his people against the Red menace. They promised to grant Viet Nam gradual independence within the new French Union. Bao was persuaded. On March 8, 1949, he signed the document creating the new Indo-Chinese Republic which he would head as chief of state. As he left the gaudy safety of the Riviera for the hazards of a country torn by civil war, he grinned and said: \u201cI risk my skin.\u201d French Communists snarled: \u201cCet empereur des boites de nuit [this nightclub emperor].\u201d\nBehind him, at the Ch\u00e2teau de Thorenc, he left Empress Nam Phuong and their family of two boys and three girls.\nStatesman. Bao Dai has been back in Indo-China about a year. He has made some progress, but it is slow and the difficulties are enormous. The French have promised his government more authority, but they are vague in making good and sometimes stupidly petty. One point of friction between Bao Dai and French High Commissioner L\u00e9on Pignon concerns the high commissioner\u2019s residence in Saigon. It is the old imperial palace, and the symbol, in native eyes, of paramount place. Bao Dai wants it for his own use, and he stays away from the city lest he lose face by residing elsewhere. The French, with bureaucratic pigheadedness, have refused to part with it, though there are reports that they will soon do so.\nAnother disappointment has been Bao Dai\u2019s effort to enlist capable ministers and lower-echelon administrators. Partly this is because so many Vietnamese are fence-sitters or fear the terror of Viet Minh agents. Partly it is a consequence of French failure, in the past and at present, to train enough natives to take over the government. Bao Dai seems to be counting on U.S. pressure to loosen up the French in this respect.\nMost serious failure is the sluggish pace in recruiting a Viet Nam army. Bao Dai\u2019s government has thus far assembled only four battalions, about 4,000 men.\nField of Decision. Though Ho Chi Minh\u2019s forces (70,000 regulars with equipment as good as the French, plus 70,000 well-trained guerrillas and an unknown number of poorly equipped village militia) have been pushed back from such centers as Hanoi in northern Viet Nam, French officers report that \u201cthe situation steadily grows no better.\u201d\nFrench Commander in Chief Marcel Carpentier aims to sweep Ho Chi Minh\u2019s men from the lower, heavily populated Mekong and Red River valleys. These are the best rice-producing areas and consequently the best source of rebel supply. By airlift and truck convoy, the French maintain a line of forts at the Chinese border, where aid could flow in for Ho.\nIt is rugged hit & run fighting in forest and swamp terrain well suited for guerrilla tactics. By day the French control about half the countryside; and if they want to, they can penetrate where they will, though ambush takes its toll. At night, however, the French draw into their forts and garrisoned centers. Then Ho Chi Minh\u2019s men steal forth, terrorize peasants, collect taxes (two-fifths of a farmer\u2019s rice harvest), and run the countryside almost everywhere\nThe French insist that the military problem is the No.. i problem, and that Western men and arms must lick it. Given sufficient U.S. equipment, up to $150 million a year or more, they think they can crush Ho Chi Minh within three years. Lacking such support, they may be facing a debacle within one year; and, of course, down in the wreckage would go Bao Dai.\nThe Piecemeal Approach. All in all, the new U.S. ally in Southeast Asia is a weak reed. And the alliance is as ironic as anything in history. For the same U.S. Government which abandoned the Chinese Nationalists because they were not good enough was committed by last fortnight\u2019s decision to defend a playboy emperor and the worst and almost the last example of white man\u2019s armed imperialism in Asia.\nNevertheless, Indo-China had to be defended\u2014if it could be defended. So had Formosa, last stand of China\u2019s Nationalists, which has advantages not to be found in Indo-China\u2014a strong government, a well-trained defending fighting force, and easily defensible tactical position. The U.S. decision to go into such a doubtful project as the defense of Indo-China was the result of an idea that it ought to do something, somehow, to stop the Communists in Southeast Asia. But the U.S. policy in Indo-China was a piecemeal operation. Not until it saw the Southeast Asia problem whole, until it went to the help of all threatened governments, would the U.S. be making soldier\u2019s or statesman\u2019s sense.\n* There was one abortive attempt to get acquainted in the 18305, when President Andrew Jackson sent Envoy Edmund Roberts of New Hampshire to draw up a treaty with Emperor Ming Mang. Reported Roberts: \u201cThe insulting formalities required as preliminaries to the treaty . . . left me no alternative save that of terminating a protracted correspondence marked . . . by duplicity and prevarication in the official servant of the Emperor.\u201d Roberts was told to 1) make five kowtows, 2) beg for \u201cdeep condescension,\u201d 3) change a sentence in President Jackson\u2019s letter to the Emperor from \u201cI pray to God\u201d to \u201cI pray to the gods of heaven.\u201d He refused.\n\u2020 The Chinese invasions took place between 213 B.C. and 186 A.D. From the latter date until the loth Century the Chinese governed the country. Then the Annamites threw off the Chinese yoke; it was clapped on again for a brief span in the 15th Century. French missionaries and traders (preceded by the Portuguese and Dutch) came to Indo-China in the 17th Century. In 1802, a French East India Company expedition helped establish Nguye\nINDO-CHINA: The New Frontier","id":"<urn:uuid:a9e34aac-8a8f-497f-bee6-437d888956ea>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/khamerlogue.wordpress.com\/indochina\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9721727967,"token_count":4988,"score":3.1875,"int_score":3}

{"text":"The Nature Elephant\nThe Karen people have always lived naturally in the forest, and, for many generations have relied on elephants to help them.\nBecause elephants are ideal for carrying heavy loads they are essential for transportation through rural areas, and, more recently, for carrying tourists. The Karen people simply would not survive without them. The Karen people have always used elephants to help carry them through dense parts of the jungle which would be difficult on foot, such as down steep hills to fetch water from the creek, or carrying heavy bags of rice from the fields to the barn. What is little effort for an elephant would be a huge amount of labour\nfor humans. Because they are so important to the Karen people, elephants are their friends, and are treated with respect.\nTo manage an elephant and gain its trust requires knowledge, love and understanding. This is why the Karen people look after their elephants so well, and only certain members of the Karen family are trained enough to do this. Some of them call elephant-care a kind of black magic, and this black magic is passed down through families.\nPart of the skill of caring for elephants is to ensure the elephant is listened to. Karen legend has it that if a female elephant is ignored, it is likely that her eggs will become infected, and therefore she will not be able to continue the elephant family. This serious consequence acts as a grave warning to those handling elephants. A sense of duty, honor and patience are as important to the elephant as they are to the Karen people as a whole.\nThe legend of Chang Karen\nThis is a story about how elephants became so important in the life of the Karen hill tribe. The legend goes that once upon a time, there were two brothers living in the forest. One day, their mother needed to leave home for a business, so instructed the two boys to look after the house, be good, and by no means split open the bamboo tree, as it contained many flies. Being the mischievous boys they were, as soon as their mother was out of sight, they crept up to the forbidden bamboo and cracked it open, curious to see what would happen.\nImmediately, the room was filled with flies, two of which flew up into each of the boys' noses. Panicking, the boys didn't know what to do. Soon, they felt their bodies changing. Their legs began to itch, and grow longer and wider. Their heads began to swell, until they felt the size and shape of footballs. Their noses grew longer and their bodies became heavier and more clumsy.\nWhen their mother returned home, she was shocked to see what had happened to her sons. She offered them cooked rice, but they turned it down with a slow shake of their large heads, their noses swinging from side to side. They were still growing, and were too ashamed of their bad behaviour to eat. The mother offered them water, but they did not want to drink it. Soon, when the sons had grown too big for the house, and could now only walk on four legs, they left the house to find grass. This was all they felt like eating.\nVery soon the word spread, and people came from all over the valley to see the mutated boys. Their tongues had become too big for them to speak, so the sons had stopped talking. As if to compensate, their ears grew large so they cold hear very, very well. They had become elephant-boys.\nOne day, some workers came to see if the elephant-boys could help them carry heavy loads. They gave them wood and lead them to their workshops, and the elephant-boys were calm and obedient. The workers realised that what was a huge job for them, was little effort for these giant elephant boys. And life continued this way for many generations. This is the remarkable story of how elephants and humans came to work together in harmony, explaining how they can exist together in the forest.\nElephants and the Karen Hill Tribe people\nDeep in the rich forests of northern Thailand, in the bowl of a green valley, lies the Karen hill tribe community. Making the most of their natural surroundings, this tribe has managed to forge an incredibly simple life in the forest using no modern machinery or medicine. They need only the trees, plants, animals, and are especially reliant on the mighty elephant.\nThe Karen people have a strong bond with elephants: their self-sufficient lifestyles are surprisingly similar, and intertwining. Wild elephants play a very important role in the Karen way of life, as well as the relationships of valley inhabitants, and the magic of the valley.","id":"<urn:uuid:e54319d9-029a-48b0-8d3d-42adb0690b50>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.asianelephantsafari.com\/news.php","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9856395721,"token_count":937,"score":3.046875,"int_score":3}

However, the first truly successful solution to the problem of rapidly transmitting language across space was the Frenchman Claude Chappe\u2019s optical telegraph.\nChappe's chain of stone towers, topped by 10-ft. poles and 14-ft. pivoting cross members, and spaced as far apart as the eye could see, was first demonstrated to the public in March of 1791 on the Champs Elysees.\nChappe created a language of 9,999 words, each represented by a different position of the swinging arms. When operated by well-trained optical telegraphers, the system was extraordinarily quick. Messages could be transmitted up to 150 miles in two minutes.\nEventually the French military saw the value of Chappe\u2019s invention, and lines of his towers were built out from Paris to Dunkirk and Strasbourg. Within a decade, a network of optical telegraph lines crisscrossed the nation. When Napoleon seized power in 1799, he used the optical telegraph to dispatch the message, \u201cParis is quiet and the good citizens are content.\u201d\nRenovated in 1998, the optical telegraph next to the Rohan Castle in Saverne functioned as part of the Strasbourg line from 1798 until 1852.

{"text":"Nov. 27, 2009 Physicists from the Japanese-led multi-national T2K neutrino collaboration have just announced that over the weekend they detected the first neutrino events generated by their newly built neutrino beam at the J-PARC (Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex) accelerator laboratory in Tokai, Japan.\nProtons from the 30-GeV Main Ring synchrotron were directed onto a carbon target, where their collisions produced charged particles called pions. These pions travelled through a helium-filled volume where they decayed to produce a beam of the elusive particles called neutrinos. These neutrinos then flew 200 metres through the earth to a sophisticated detector system capable of making detailed measurements of their energy, direction, and type. The data from the complex detector system is still being analysed, but the physicists have seen at least 3 neutrino events, in line with the expectation based on the current beam and detector performance.\nThis detection therefore marks the beginning of the operational phase of the T2K experiment, a 474-physicist, 13-nation collaboration to measure new properties of the ghostly neutrino. Neutrinos interact only weakly with matter, and thus pass effortlessly through the earth (and mostly through the detectors!). Neutrinos exist in three types, called electron, muon, and tau; linked by particle interactions to their more familiar charged cousins like the electron. Measurements over the last few decades, notably by the Super Kamiokande and KamLAND neutrino experiments in western Japan, have shown that neutrinos possess the strange property of neutrino oscillations, whereby one type of neutrino will turn into another as they propagate through space. Neutrino oscillations, which require neutrinos to have mass and therefore were not allowed in our previous theoretical understanding of particle physics, probe new physical laws and are thus of great interest in the study of the fundamental constituents of matter.\nThey may even be related to the mystery of why there is more matter than anti-matter in the universe, and thus are the focus of intense study worldwide.\nPrecision measurements of neutrino oscillations can be made using artificial neutrino beams, as pioneered by the K2K neutrino experiment where neutrinos from the KEK laboratory were detected using the vast Super Kamiokande neutrino detector near Toyama. T2K is a more powerful and sophisticated version of the K2K experiment, with a more intense neutrino beam derived from the newly-built Main Ring synchrotron at the J-PARC accelerator laboratory.\nThe beam was built by physicists from KEK in cooperation with other Japanese institutions and with assistance from the US, Canadian, UK and French T2K institutes. Prof. Chang Kee Jung of Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, leader of the US T2K project, said \"I am somewhat stunned by this seemingly effortless achievement considering the complexity of the machinery, the operation and international nature of the project. This is a result of a strong support from the Japanese government for basic science, which I hope will continue, and hard work and ingenuity of all involved. I am excited about more ground breaking findings from this experiment in the near future.\"\nThe beam is aimed once again at Super-Kamiokande, which has been upgraded for this experiment with new electronics and software. Before the neutrinos leave the J-PARC facility their properties are determined by a sophisticated \"near\" detector, partly based on a huge magnet donated from CERN where it had earlier been used for neutrino experiments (and for the UA1 experiment, which won the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the W and Z bosons which are the basis of neutrino interactions), and it is this detector which caught the first events.\nThe first neutrino events were detected in a specialize detector, called the INGRID, whose purpose is to determine the neutrino beam's direction and profile. Further tests of the T2K neutrino beam are scheduled for December, and the experiment plans to begin production running in mid-January. Another major milestone should be observed soon after -- the first observation of a neutrino event from the T2K beam in the Super-Kamiokande experiment. Running will continue until the summer, by which time the experiment hopes to have made the most sensitive search yet achieved for a so-far unobserved critical neutrino oscillation mode dominated by oscillations between all three types of neutrinos.\nIn the coming years this search will be improved even further, with the hope that the 3-mode oscillation will be observed, allowing measurements to begin comparing the oscillations of neutrinos and anti-neutrinos, probing the physics of matter\/ anti-matter asymmetry in the neutrino sector.\nOther social bookmarking and sharing tools:\nNote: If no author is given, the source is cited instead.","id":"<urn:uuid:73f94bf7-72a9-431b-90ac-37db05302858>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2009\/11\/091127141406.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9419696331,"token_count":1033,"score":3.34375,"int_score":3}

However, these new model organisms have to be carefully selected.\nHemerocallis (the daylily) satisfies multiple criteria for selection and deserves serious consideration as a subject of intensive biological investigation. Several attributes of the genus are of great biological interest. These include the strict control of flower opening and, within a short period, the precisely regulated floral death by a programmed cell death system. The self-incompatibility system in Hemerocallis is also noteworthy and deserves more attention. Importantly, the genus is widely cultivated for food, medicinal value and ornamental interest. Hemerocallis has considerable potential as a \u2018nutraceutical\u2019 food plant and the source of new compounds with biomedical activity. The genus has also been embraced by ornamental plant breeders and the extraordinary morphological diversity of hybrid cultivars, produced within a relatively short time by amateur enthusiasts, is an exceptional resource for botanical and genetic studies.\nThis paper in AoB PLANTS explores these points in detail, explaining the reasons why this genus has considerable value \u2013 both academic and socio-economic \u2013 and deserves new resources devoted to its exploration as a model. Its impact as a future model will be enhanced by its amenability to cultivation in laboratory and field conditions.

{"text":"What are placement tests?\nCertain academic subjects, such as mathematics, often have multiple levels at which student may start when they begin college. Placement tests are academic-subject tests that allow colleges to determine what level a student is ready to enter in each of those subjects.\nWhat academic subjects require placement tests?\nThe most common subjects tested for placement are English, mathematics and chemistry. Foreign language placement is also tests at some colleges.\nDo all colleges require them?\nNot all colleges require placement tests. Some colleges, typically smaller, for-profit colleges, will only offer one level of their courses. In those cases, there is no need for placement testing.\nSome colleges that do not give placement testing use other information for placement evaluation such as admissions testing (SAT or ACT) or high school coursework.\nWhen do I take them?\nMany colleges give placement testing during orientation. Community colleges often offer testing on a daily basis in order to more conveniently fit testing into the schedules of newly admitted students.\nCheck with your admission counselor to find out when your testing will be given or if you need to register for your testing.\nShould I study for placement tests?\nIn general, to ensure proper placement, it is best to brush up on any subject that you have not recently studied. For example, if you have not taken a mathematics course in your last semester of high school, then it is helpful to review mathematics. Also, if you have taken time off between high school and college, it will be helpful to review all subjects on the placement test. If you do not review material before placement tests, you may be placed in a course that is below your ability because you had forgotten some of the information you previously learned.\nSome colleges will post information about the placement testing on their websites. This information may include the types of information to review. You can also ask your admissions counselor what you should review for your placement test.\nWhat is the format of the test?\nThe testing format varies among colleges. Some colleges\u00ed placement tests are computerized, while other colleges\u00ed placement tests are paper tests. Testing can be multiple choice or completion. There may be essays required. Your admissions counselor should be able to give you information about what the test will be like.\nWill I need to bring anything for the test?\nYou should ask this question of your admissions counselor or the person you speak with to register for the test. Some colleges do not require students to bring anything to their placement testing.\nSome items you may want to bring to your placement testing:\n- Photo ID\n- Sweater (in case the room is chilly)\n- Money for vending machines\nDo transfer students have to take placement tests?\nIn most cases, transfer students do not have to take placement tests. However, it often depends on the courses the student has completed. For example, transfer students who have not taken a mathematics course at their previous college, may be required to take only the mathematics section of placement testing.\nIf I took placement testing at another college, do I have to re-take it?\nThis is a question for your admissions counselor. Some colleges do allow students who can demonstrate a previous placement from another college to forgo placement testing. Colleges that do not require admissions testing (SAT or ACT) may waive testing for individuals who achieved certain scores on their admissions tests. However, in most cases colleges require students to take their test.","id":"<urn:uuid:e03c02ff-f286-49a4-a113-548f94158ae7>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.bellaonline.com\/articles\/art51903.asp","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.948947072,"token_count":700,"score":2.625,"int_score":3}

Moreover, the emitted light waves are coherent, meaning that all of the energy peaks and troughs are precisely in step.\nNow, a team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has demonstrated experimentally that a cloud consisting of millions of atoms can also be made coherent. Instead of flying about and colliding randomly, the atoms display coordinated behavior, acting as if the entire assemblage were a single entity.\nAccording to quantum mechanics, atoms can behave like waves. Thus, two overlapping clouds made up of atoms in coherent states should produce a zebra-striped interference pattern of dark and light fringes, just like those generated when two beams of ordinary laser light overlap.\nBy detecting such a pattern, the researchers proved that the clouds' atoms are coherent and constitute an \"atom laser,\" says physicist Wolfgang Ketterle, who heads the MIT group. These matter waves, in principle, can be focused just like light.\nKetterle and his coworkers describe their observations in the Jan. 31 Science.\nThe demonstration of coherence involving large numbers of atoms is the latest step in a series of studies of a remarkable state of matter called a Bose-Einstein condensate. Chilled to temperatures barely above absolute zero, theory predicted, the atoms would collectively enter the same quantum state and behave like a single unit, or superparticle, with a specific wavelength.\nFirst created in the laboratory in 1995 by Eric A. Cornell and his collaborators at the University of Colorado and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, both in Boulder, Bose-Einstein condensates have been the subject of intense investigation ever since (SN: 7\/15\/95, p. 36; 5\/25\/96, p. 327).\nAt MIT, Ketterle and his colleagues cool sodium atoms to temperatures below 2 microkelvins. The frigid atoms are then confined in a special magnetic trap inside a vacuum chamber.\nTo determine whether the atoms in the resulting condensate are indeed as coherent as photons in a laser beam, the researchers developed a novel method of extracting a clump of atoms from the trap.\nIn effect, they manipulate the magnetic states of the atoms to expel an adjustable fraction of the original cloud; under the influence of gravity, the released clump falls. The method can produce a sequence of descending clumps, with each containing 100,000 to several million coherent atoms.\nThe apparatus acts like a dripping faucet, Ketterle says. He and his colleagues describe the technique in the Jan. 27 Physical Review Letters.\nTo demonstrate interference, the MIT group created a double magnetic trap so that two pulses of coherent atoms could be released at the same time. As the two clumps fell, they started to spread and overlap. The researchers could then observe interference between the atomic waves of the droplets.\n\"The signal was almost too good to be true,\" Ketterle says. \"We saw a high-contrast, very regular pattern.\"\n\"It's a beautiful result,\" Cornell remarks. \"This work really shows that Bose-Einstein condensation is an atom laser.\"\nFrom the pattern, the MIT researchers deduced that the condensate of sodium atoms has a wavelength of about 30 micrometers, considerably longer than the 0.04-nanometer wavelength typical of individual atoms at room temperature.\nKetterle and his colleagues are already planning several improvements to their primitive atom laser, including getting more atoms into the emitted pulses and going from pulses to a continuous beam.\nPractical use of an atom laser for improving the precision of atomic clocks and for manipulating atoms is still distant, however, Cornell notes.","id":"<urn:uuid:5a667bf7-c324-483a-8231-ce8448d754f3>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.sciencenews.org\/pages\/sn_arc97\/2_1_97\/fob2.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9335469007,"token_count":769,"score":4.0,"int_score":4}
{"text":"Creature Feature: American Beech (Fagus grandifolia)\nBy Emma Dean, CG Science Editor\nThough once believed to have a range that covered what would be the continental United States until the glacial period, American beech currently maintains a slightly lesser native geographic habitat, which is still quite impressive. American beech covers the eastern U.S. and Canada from Florida to Quebec, as well as Utah.\nIndigenous to North America, European colonists recognized the tree as a relative of the European beech and gathered the beechnuts to extract the oil which is similar to olive oil. The beechnuts, which persist through winter, can become somewhat of a litter problem, but not the leaf litter due to the fact that after turning a lovely bronze color, the leaves stay on the tree throughout winter. As autumn ends and winter begins, the leaves become less bronze and resemble thin, curled parchment paper.\nDue to a shallow root system, grass does not sprout beneath the tree. This is not entirely noticeable because the short trunk allows the branches to nearly touch the ground. Its roots are unique, also, in that they routinely develop root suckers, which is when the root system is the site of new growth that then grows upward and out of the ground to form new branches and essentially a clone of the original tree. Entire beech groves have been known to grow from the roots of a single tree.\nAmerican beech is notorious for having incredibly smooth, light grey bark even as it advances in age. Though not necessarily beneficial for the tree, American beech is also notorious for being a favorite for carved initials and dates which are preserved indefinitely.\n- American beech is a larval host as well as a nectar source for Early Hairstreak.\n- American beech is at home in the following states: Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Mississippi, North Carolina, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Vermont, Wisconsin, West Virginia and also Washington D.C.\n- This beech is often associated with the extinct Passenger Pigeon, which consumed beechnuts and roosted in its branches.\n- A few minor pest issues that affect American beech include powdery mildew, aphids, canker and beech bark disease.\n- Though it has a slow growth rate, American beech will grow to a height between 50-70 feet.\n- The general lifespan for an American beech is 300-400 years.","id":"<urn:uuid:03be70af-a8d8-4a7c-a3fd-96a187a05983>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.collegegreenmag.com\/creature-feature-american-beech-fagus-grandifolia","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9436998367,"token_count":553,"score":3.53125,"int_score":4}
{"text":"Thursday June 14 2012\n\"Diesel exhaust fumes cause cancer\": official WHO report\nThe Daily Mail reports a World Health Organization (WHO) warning that diesel exhaust fumes are a \u201cmajor cancer risk\u201d and belong in the \u201csame deadly category as asbestos, arsenic and mustard gas\u201d. Meanwhile the BBC says that diesel fumes are \u201cdefinitely a cause of lung cancer\u201d.\nThis widely reported news is based on a decision by the WHO to classify diesel exhausts as a cause of cancer.\nThe decision was taken by the WHO\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a panel of experts that co-ordinates and conducts research into the causes of cancer, and develops cancer control strategies.\nUnder its classification scheme, diesel exhaust was previously categorised as \u201cprobably carcinogenic\u201d. The agency now says there is now sufficient evidence that exposure to diesel fumes causes lung cancer. It is calling for exposure to diesel fumes to be reduced worldwide.\nWhile diesel fumes are now officially carcinogenic, the alarmist tone of the Daily Mail\u2019s headline should be viewed with caution because the \u2018deadly category\u2019 of substances the Mail describes also includes sunlight and wood dust.\nWhat is diesel and is it used much in the UK?\nDiesel oil is a complex mixture of chemicals, mainly distilled from crude oil, although vegetable oil and similar sources can be used to make \u2018biodiesel\u2019. It is used as fuel for diesel internal combustion engines, which use compressed hot air to ignite fuel (petrol engines have a spark plug to ignite the fuel).\nWorldwide, diesel oil is widely used as a fuel in diesel-powered cars, lorries, trains, aircraft, ships and heavy industry. It is regarded as more efficient than petroleum, resulting in lower fuel consumption. WHO says that many people are exposed to diesel exhaust in everyday life, both through their occupations and in the ambient air.\nAs of 2007, just over 50% of all new car sales in the UK were diesel, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. In 2004, approximately 700 litres (150 gallons) of diesel was sold every second in the UK, according to a report by the Health Protection Agency (HPA).\nThe amount of pollutants from diesel exhaust fumes, in particular its sulphur content, have been reduced over the last few years, and engines on newer cars are designed to burn fuel more efficiently, reducing emissions. However, the IARC says it is not yet clear how these improvements translate into any changes in the impact of diesel fumes on human health. Existing fuels and older unmodified vehicles will take years to replace, particularly in less developed countries where regulations are less stringent, the IARC says.\nWhat is the WHO\u2019s classification scheme?\nThe WHO classifies the cancer-causing potential of various substances into four groups, depending on the evidence available in both humans and other animals:\n- Group 1 is used when a substance causes cancer in humans\n- Group 2A is used when a substance \u2018probably\u2019 causes cancer in humans\n- Group 2B is used when a substance \u2018possibly\u2019 causes cancer in humans\n- Group 3 is used when a substance is not classifiable in terms of its cancer-causing properties in humans because the evidence is inadequate\n- Group 4 is used when a substance is \u2018probably not\u2019 a cause of cancer in humans\nWhat is the WHO now saying about diesel fumes and cancer?\nSince 1988, diesel oil fumes have been classified by the IARC as \u2018probably carcinogenic to humans\u2019. This category is used when there is some, limited evidence that a substance causes cancer in humans, but sufficient evidence it causes cancer in experimental animals.\nHowever, the IARC has now reclassified diesel engine exhaust as \u2018carcinogenic\u2019 (group 1 on the list above). This category is used when there is sufficient evidence that a substance causes cancer in humans. The IARC says there is sufficient evidence that diesel exhaust is a cause of lung cancer. It is also associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer, although the evidence for the latter is more limited.\nWhy has the advice changed?\nThe WHO says there has been mounting concern in recent years about the cancer-causing potential of diesel engine exhaust, based on findings from epidemiological studies of workers exposed to diesel fumes. In particular, it cites a large cohort study, published in March this year, of occupational exposure to diesel exhaust in 12,315 US miners. The study was run by the US National Cancer Institute and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. It found that exposure to diesel exhaust increased the risk of dying from lung cancer (1.26, 95% confidence interval 1.09 to 1.44). A further case-control study, undertaken in this group (comparing 198 miners who had died from lung cancer with 562 miners who were alive at the time the \u2018case\u2019 died), found that the risk of lung cancer in these workers increased with the length of time they were exposed to diesel fumes.\nAlthough these studies were in workers who had been heavily exposed to diesel fumes, the WHO points out that studies of other carcinogens, such as radon, indicate that initial research showing a risk in heavily exposed populations, are later found to be a risk for the general population. It says that action to reduce exposure to diesel exhaust fumes should encompass both highly exposed workers and the general population.\nAre diesel fumes really as dangerous as asbestos and mustard gas?\nUnder the IARC classification scheme, diesel fumes now fall into the same category as all other known carcinogens (of which there are over 100 listed). These include:\n- tobacco smoke (both first and secondhand)\n- mustard gas\n- Chinese salted fish\n- vinyl chloride\n- wood dust\nThe WHO does not specify the level of risk posed by different carcinogens, or the risk posed by different levels of exposure. However, for most carcinogens, the higher the exposure, the greater the risk of cancer.\nDr Christopher Portier, chair of the IARC working group, said that while the scientific evidence that diesel oil exhaust caused lung cancer was \u2018compelling\u2019, the impact on the wider population who are exposed to diesel fumes at much lower levels and for shorter periods of time, is unknown.\nNewspaper readers of a nervous disposition may want to consider the above facts when considering the risk to their health from diesel fumes.\nAnalysis by Bazian.

Your support will help MIT OpenCourseWare continue to offer high quality educational resources for free.

I'm going to remind you, we were talking about it because we suggested it is a really powerful way of structuring systems, and that's really why we want to use it, It's a very common way of structuring systems. So today I'm going to pick up on a bunch of more nuanced, or more complex if you like, ways of leveraging the power of classes. But we're going to see a bunch of examples that are going to give us a sense. I'm going to talk about inheritance, we're going to talk about shadowing, we're going to talk about iterators. But before get to it, I want to start by just highlighting, sort of, what was the point of classes? So I'll remind you.\nA class, I said, was basically a template for an abstract data type. And this was really to drive home this idea of modularity. I want the ability to say, I've got a set of things that naturally belong together, I'm going to cluster them together, I want to treat it like it's a primitive, I want to treat it like it's a float or an int or a string. Is this going to be a point or a segment or something different like that. So it's really a way, as I said, of just trying to cluster data together. And this is a notion of modularity slash abstraction where I'm treating them as primitives. But the second thing we talked about is that we also have a set of methods, using the special name method because we're talking classes. But basically functions that are designed to deal with this data structure. We're trying to group those together as well. So we cluster data and methods.\nSecond key thing we said was, in the ideal case, which unfortunately Python isn't, but we'll come back to that, in the ideal case, we would have data hiding, and by data hiding, which is sort of a version of encapsulation, what we meant was that you could only get to the internal pieces of that data structure through a proscribed method. Proscribed meaning it's something I set up. So data hiding saying, you would only access the parts through a method. And as we said, unfortunately Python does not enforce this. Meaning that I could create one of these data structures, ideally I'd have a method, that I'm going to see some examples of that I used to get the parts out, unfortunately in Python you could take the name the instance dot some internal variable you'll get it back. It is exposed. And this is actually just not a good idea. So I suggested in my very bad humor, that you practice computational hygiene and you only use appropriate methods to get the parts out. OK didn't laugh the joke last time, you're not going to laugh at it this time, I don't blame you. All right, and then the last piece of this is that we said the class is a template. When we call that class, it makes an instance. So class is used to make instances, meaning particular versions, of that structure, and we said inside the instances we have a set of attributes. Internal variables, methods, that are going to belong to that structure.\nOK, so with that in mind, here's what I want to do. I'm going to show you a set of examples, and I want to warn you ahead of time, the code handout today is a little longer than normal because we want to build essentially an extended example of a sequence of examples of classes. We're going to see the idea, of which we're gonna talk about, of inheritance or hierarchy, in which we can have classes that are specializations of other classes. We're gonna see how we can inherit methods, how we can shadow methods, how we can use methods in a variety of ways. So this is a way of suggesting you may find it more convenient to put notes on the code handout rather than in your own notes. Do whatever you like, but I just wanted to alert you, we're going to go through a little more code than normal.\nSo, the little environment I'm going to build is an environment of people. I'll build a simple little simulation of people. So I'm going to start off with the first class, which I've got up on the screen, and it's on your handout as well, which is I'm going to build an instance, or a class rather, of persons. I'm going to draw a diagram, which I'm gonna try and see if I can do well, over here, of the different objects we're going to have. So I've got, a class, and by the way a class is an object. Instances are also objects, but classes are objects. We're gonna see why we want that in a second. Because I'm gonna build an object, sorry a class, called a person. Now, let's walk through some of the pieces here. The first one is, there's something a little different. Remember last time we had that keyword class and then a name, that name, in this case, person says this is the name for the class, and then we would have just had the semicolon and a bunch of internal things. Here I've got something in parens, and I want to stress this is not a variable. All right, this is not a def, this is a class. I'm going to come back to it, but what this is basically saying is that the person class is going to inherit from another class, which in this case is just the built-in Python object class. Hold on to that thought, it's going to make more sense when we look at a little more interesting example, but I want to highlight that. All right now, if we do this, as I said before, we can create a version of a person, let me just call it per, person.\nOK? And what we said last time is, when we wanted to create an instance inside of this class definition, we've got one of those built-in things called init. I'm gonna again remind you, some of the methods we have, Underbar underbar init is going to be the thing that creates the instance. Actually slightly misspeaking, actually Python creates the instance, but it's one thing that fills it in. So in this case, I'm going to give it 2 arguments: Frank Foobar Now, you might have said, wait a minute, init here has 3 arguments: self, family name, and first name. So again, just to remind you, what we said happens here is that when I call this class, person, I'm creating an instance. We'll draw a little instance diagram down here. I'm going to give it the name per. And I should have said inside of person, we've got a set of things. We've got our underbar underbar init, we've got, what else do I have up there? Family name. And a bunch of other methods, down to say.\nWhat happens inside of Python is, when we called the class definition, person, it creates an instance, there it is. Think of it as a pointer to a spot in memory, and then what we do is, we call, or find, that init method, up here, and we apply it. And the first argument self, points to the instance. So this object here is what self looks at. Now you can see what init's going to do. It says, oh, inside of self, which is pointing to here, let me bind a variable, which was, can read that very carefully, it's family underbar name, to the value I passed in, which was 4. Same thing with first name. OK, so the reason I'm stressing this is, self we do not supply explicitly, it is supplied as pointing to the instance, it's giving us that piece of memory. And that is what then gets created. So here's, now, the instance for per. OK, and I put a little label on there, I'm going to call that an isALink, because it is an instance of that class. God bless you.\nAll right, so once we got this, let's look at what we can do with person. That's why I built person here. And as I said, I've already bound basically, those two pieces. If I want to get a value out, I can give person, or per, rather, this instance, a messaging. In this case I want to get family, what did I say, family name out, now, again I want to stress, what is happening here? per is an instance, it's this thing here. When I say per dot family name, I'm sending it a message, in essence what that does is, it says, from here it's going to go up the chain to this class object and find the appropriate method, which was family name. It is then going to apply that to self, which points to this instance. And that allows it, therefore, is you can see on the code, to look up under self, what's the binding for family name, and print it back up. So self is always going to point to the instance I want and I can use it. OK what else do we have in here? We can get the first name, that's not particularly interesting.\nWe've got 2 other special methods: that's cmp and str. All right, cmp is our comparison method. And since I, I was about to say I blew it last time, I misspoke last time, a wonderful phrase that politicians like to use, I misspoke last time. Let me clarify again what cmp will do. Underbar underbar cmp is going to be the method you're going to use to compare two instances of an object. Now, let's back up for second. If I wanted to test equality, in fact I could use underbar underbar eq, under under. It's natural to think about an equality tester as returning a Boolean, it's either gonna be true or false, because something's either equal to or not. In many languages, comparisons also return Booleans, which is why I went down this slippery slope. For many languages, either it's greater than or it's not. But Python is different. Python use cmp, in fact it has a built in cmp, which is what we're relying on here. Where am I, right there. And what cmp returns is 1 of 3 values. Given 2 objects, it says if the first one is less than the second one, it returns -1, if it's equal it returns 0, if it's greater than, it returns 1.\nSo it allows you this broader range of comparisons. And if you think about it, cmp, you could apply on integers, you could apply it on floats, apply it on strings. So it's overloaded, it has the ability to do all of those. And in this case what we're saying is, given 2 objects, let's create a tuple of the first, sorry, family and first name of ourselves, and other is another object, family and first name of that, and then just use cmp to compare them. All right, so it's going to use the base pieces. OK, so it gives me a way of doing comparisons. And str we saw last time as well, this is cmp does comparison, and str is our printed representation.\nOK. So what we've got now, is a simple little class. We've also got two methods there. I want to look at them, we're gonna come back to them, but they start to highlight things we can do with our classes. So I've built one simple version of it here, which is per. And notice I've got another method, right up here, called say. And say takes two arguments, for the moment the second argument, or the first argument's, not going to make a lot of sense, but say takes two arguments besides itself. It's going to take another object to which it's saying something and the thing to say. Since I only have one object here, I'm going to have person talk to himself. You may have met a few other undergraduates who have this behavior. I'll have him talk to himself and say, just some random message the faculty members occasionally worry about. OK, what does this thing do? Now you're going to see some of the power of this. Again, remember, I'm down here, I'm sending this the message say, it's going to go up the chain to find the say message in person. And what does say do, it says given another object and some string, it's going to return, oh, and interesting things, part of which you can't see on the screen. First what it does, is it gets first name of self. Remember self is pointing to this instance, so it's simply looks up that binding, which is Frank. It's going to create a string in which it adds to that the family name of self, and then another thing that says to, and then ah, I'm now going to send a message to the other object, saying give me your first name. Going to add that to the second piece, and you can see in this case it happens to be the same first and family name. And then at the end of it, which you can't see here but you can see in your handout, I just append the whole string, so it spits it out.\nWhat's the point of this, other than I can get it to say things? Notice, I can now reference values of the instance. But I can also get values of other instances, by sending in a message. And that's why we have that form right there. And then it glued all together. If you think about this for a second, you might say, wait a minute, actually you might have said wait a minute a while ago, why am I just using the variable name there in the function over here? Well in fact, I could've used the function here, first name open close, right? It would have done the same thing. But because I know I'm inside the instance, it's perfectly reasonable to just look up the value. OK, I could have, although I don't want you to do it, have done the same thing there and used underbar, sorry, first name underbar, sorry, first underbar name, but that's really breaking this contract that I want to happen. I should send the message to get the method back out. So again the standard practices is if you know you're inside the object, you can just access the values. If you're doing it with any other objects, send it a message to get it out.\nOK, now, that gives you an ability to say, let's look at one more example here, and then we're going to start building our hierarchy, which is, that this person can also sing. And we've got a little sing method here. And notice what it does, it's going to sing to somebody, I guess you're part of the Chorallaries. You're going to sing something, and notice what it does, it's simply going to use its say method, but add at the end of whatever's being said, just tra la la at the end. So this is now an example of a method using another method. Why would you want that? It's nice modularly. I have one method that's doing saying, I have another method that's just building on it. So if I have is person sing to themselves, not a highly recommended activity, it would help if I had it sing to itself, not sing to sing, sorry about that. Notice what it does. Looks like exactly like a say method, except it's got tra la la at the end. Don't worry I'm not going to sing to you. I'll simply say the words. Power of this, other than the silly examples. You see how I can access variables of the instance, how I can access variables of other instances, going to come back to that, and how I can use versions of my own methods to implement other methods. In this case sing is using say as part of what it wants to get out.\nOK, so we got a simple little example. Now, let's start adding some other pieces to this. OK, and what do I want to add. Find my spot here. OK, we're going to add an MIT person. Sorry, machine is -- do this, let's go down. OK so I'm going to add an MIT person. Look at the code for second. Aha! Notice what this says. MIT person says it inherits from person. That is, that's the first thing in parens up there. It says, you know, class of MIT person is person. What that is saying is, that this is a specialization of the person class. Or another way of saying it is, we have a super class, in this case it's person. And we have a subclass, in this case its MIT person. And we're going to walk through some examples, but what it says is that that subclass of MIT person can inherit the attributes of the person class. Can inherit the methods, it can inherit variables.\nOK, what does MIT person do? Well, here's 1 of the new things it does. It has a local variable called next id num, which is initially set to 0. See that up there. And then it's got some methods, it's got an init method, a get id method, a few other things. OK, let's run this. In particular, I go back down to this one. Let me just uncomment this and do it here. Assuming my machine will do what I want it to do, which it really doesn't seem to want to do today. Try one more time. Thank you, yep. Still not doing it for me, John. OK, we type it. No idea what Python doesn't like me today, but it doesn't. So we're gonna define p 1, I've lost my keyboard, indeed I have. Try one more time. p 1 MIT person, see how fast I can type here -- OK, now, let's look at what the code does, because again it's going to highlight some things. I called MIT person, push this up slightly, it's going to create an instance down here, I called p 1. And when I would do that, I'm gonna initialize it. So I've got, right up here, an initializer, init for MIT person, takes in the family name and the first name. Notice what it does. Huh. It says, if I'm sitting here at MIT person, I'm going to go up and inherit from person its init function and call it. And what am I calling it on? I'm calling it on self, which is pointing to this object, so I've still got it, and then I'm then going to apply the base initialization. And that does exactly what you'd expect, which is just going to create a binding for family name down here. As well as some other things. So this is an example of inheritance. MIT person inherits the init method from person, can get access to by simply referring to it, and I refer to it right there. And it's take the person class, get its init and apply it to my instance plus those things. So I'm just using the same piece of code\nNotice the second thing it does. It says inside of self, I'm going to bind the local variable id name to the value of next id name in MIT person. Self is down here, id num, sorry, not id name. I'm going to bind that to the value that I find my going up to here, which is 0, and having done that, I simply increment that value. OK? So what has this done? It says I now have captured in the class, a local variable that I can keep track of. And when I use it, every time I generate an example, let me build another one. I make p 2 another MIT person. OK, I can do things like saying, what is the id number for each of these. First one is 0, second one is 1, which makes sense, right? I'm just incrementing a global variable. Now, things I want you to see about this. Now that I've got a beginning of a hierarchy, I have this notion of inheritance. I can ask a function inside one class to use a function from a class that it can reach by going up the chain. I just did it there. I can ask it to go get values of variables, right, so that looks good. What else do we have in person or MIT person? Well, we can get the id number, we just did. We have a thing to do with this string. Notice it's going to print out something a little different. In fact, there's a kind of funky form there. Which just says, if I want to print it out, I'm gonna create, what this says to do is, I'm gonna create an output template that has that structure to it, but where I see that percent s I'm going to substitute this value for the first one, that value for the second. So if I say, what is p 1? It says ok, MIT person Fred Smith. On the other hand, if I said, what is per, which is that thing I build earlier, it had a different string method, which is just print out person, those pieces.\nAll right, one last piece to this and we're going to add to it. Suppose I want Fred to say something. Say something to Jane. OK, he said it. Where's the say method? OK, Fred is an instance of an MIT person. where's the say method? Well, there isn't one there, but again, that's where the hierarchy comes in. Fred is this object here, I'm sending it the message say. That turns into going up the chain to this object, which is the class object, and saying find a say method and apply it to that instance. Fudge-knuckle, it ain't here. Don't worry about it, because it says if I can't find one there, I'm going to go up the chain to this method, sorry to this class, and look for a method there. Which there was one, I have a say method. It's going to use that say method. Apply to it. Well, you might say, OK, what happens if it isn't there? Well, that's where, remember I defined person to be an instance of an object, it will go up the chain one last time to the base object in Python to see is there a method there or not. Probably isn't a say method for an object, so at that point it's going to raise an exception or throw an error. But now you again see this idea that the inheritance lets you capture methods.\nNow you might say, why not just put a say method inside of MIT person? Well, if you wanted it to do something different, that would be the right thing to do. But the whole notion here's that I'm capturing modularity, I've got base methods up in my base class. If I just want to use them I'm just going to inherit them by following that chain, if you like, basically up the track. OK, so we've got an MIT person, we can use that. Let's add a little bit more to our hierarchy here. I'm going to create, if I can do this right, a specialization of an MIT person, which is an undergraduate. A special kind of MIT person. All right, so if I go back up here, even though my thing is not going to let me do it, let's build an undergraduate. OK, there's the class definition for an undergrad. We're just starting to see some of the pieces, right, so in an undergraduate, where am I here, an undergraduate. OK, it's also got an initialization function. So if I call undergrad, I'm gonna make an undergrad here, again let me go back down here, line ug 2 it's making undergrad, Jane Doe. Now, what happens when I do the initialization here? Notice what goes on. It simply calls the person initialization method. All right, so I'm down here. I'm going to call the person initialization method, what did do? Sorry, the MIT person method, it calls the person method. Just walking up the chain, that's going to do exactly what I did with all the other ones, so I now have a family name and a first name. So I can, for example, say family name and get it back out. All right?\nAnd then, other things that I can do, well I can set what year the person's in, I can figure out what year they're in, there's this unfortunate overflow error if you've hung around too long, but that's not going to happen to you. And I've now got a say method here, so let's look what happens if I ask the undergraduate to say something. OK, it's not a realistic dialogue I know, but, what did this method do? I asked this object to do a say. And notice what it does. It simply passes it back up to MIT person. There's that inheritance again. It's saying, I'm going to have my base say method say something. I'm going to say it to a person, but all I'm going to do because undergraduates in my experience, at least, are always very polite, I'm going to put \"Excuse me but\" at the front of it. OK, what am I trying to show you here? I know the jokes are awful, but what am I trying to show you here? That I can simply pass up the chain to get it. In fact, what method does the final say here? What class does it come from? Person class, yes, thank you. It goes all the way up to person, right, because MIT person didn't have a say. So I can simply walk up the chain until I find the method I want to have.\nNow this is an example of shadowing. Not a great example, but it's a beginning example of shadowing, in that this same method for an undergraduate, shadows the base say method, it happens to call it, but it changes it. It puts \"Excuse me but\" at the front, before it goes on to do something. Now again, I could have decided here to actually copy what the original say method did, stitch all the other things together. But again, that loses my modularity. I'd really to only have to change it in one place. So by putting my say method up in person, I can add these nuances to it, and it lets me have something that has that variation. If I decide I want to change what say does, I only have to change it in one place. It is in the person class definition, and everything else will follow through for free.\nOK, so now I've got an undergrad, right? Let's look at a couple of variations of what happens here. So first of all, I can -- yes?\nPROFESSOR 2: Shadowing here is often sometimes called overriding.\nPROFESSOR: Yes, thank you, because I'm going to do a pure example of shadowing in a second, John right. Also called overriding. Part of the reason I like the phrase shadow is, if you think about it as looking at it from this direction, you see this version of init before you see the other ones, or you see that version of say, but it is overriding the base say example. OK, so I can say, what does p 1, sorry, yes, what does undergrad look like? And I said wait a minute, MIT person, not undergrad, is that right? Well, where's the str method? I didn't define one in undergrad, so it again tracks up the chain and finds the str method here, so it's OK undergrads are MIT people most the time, so it's perfectly fine.\nOK, now, I have built into this also these cmp methods. So I've got two examples. I've got undergrad, or ug. And then I've got poor old Frank Foobar back there, per person. So suppose I want to compare them? What do you think happens here? Compare sounds weird, right, I compare an undergraduate to a person. I don't know what that's doing, some kind of weird psychological thing, but what do you think happens in terms of the code here if I run this. I know it's a little hard because you got a lot of code to look at. Do I have a cmp method defined somewhere? Yeah. So, it's hard to know what it's going to do, but let's look at it. Hmm. Now sometimes I type things and I got errors I don't expect, this one I did expect. So what happened here? Well let's talk about what happens if I do that comparison I was doing, what was I doing? Ug greater than per? What unwinds into is, I'm going to send to ug, that instance, a cmp method. This is really going to become something like ug dot under under cmp under under applied to per. I think that's close.\nWhat does that do? It says starting in ug, I'm going to look for the first cmp method I could find, which is actually sitting here. I had a cmp method in MIT person. If you look at your code, what does it do? It looks up the id numbers to compare them. Well the, ug has an id number because it was created along this chamber. Remember per over here was just created as a person. It doesn't have an id number, so that's why it complaints. Ok, happens if I do that? Compare per to ug. How many people think I get an error? Wow. How many people think I'm going to get either true or false out of this? A few brave hands. Why? Can I ask you, please? Why do you think I'm going to get a, doesn't matter whether it's true or false, why am I going to have something work this time that didn't work last time?\nPROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly. And in case you didn't hear it, thank you, great answer, sorry, terrible throw. In this case I'm using per, that's the first part, so it's not symmetric. It's gonna use per to do the look up. And as it was said there, per over here goes up and finds a cmp method here which it can apply. In that case, it simply looked at, remember, it took the tuples of first and last name which are both defined here, and did some comparison on that. So this is a way of again pointing out to you that the things are not always symmetric, and I have to be careful about where do I find the methods as I want to use them.\nOk? All right. Let's add, I'm gonna do two more classes here. Let's add one more class, some people debate whether these are really people or not, but we're going to add a class called a professor. OK. Now what am I doing? I'm creating another version of class down here. Which again is an instance, or a subclass, sorry, not an instance, a subclass of an MIT person. I see that because I built it to be there. Again I've got an initialization that's going to call the person initialization, which we know is going to go up -- I keep saying that -- going to call the MIT person initialization, which is going to go up and call this one. So again I'm going to be able to find names. And I do a couple of other different things here. I'm gonna pass in a rank, full professor, associate professor, assistant professor, which I'm just going to bind locally. But I'm gonna add one other piece here, which is I'm gonna add a little dictionary on teaching. So when I create a professor, I'm gonna associate with it a dictionary that says, what have you been teaching?\nAnd then notice the methods I create. I've got a method here called add teaching, takes, obviously a pointer to the instance. A term, which will just be a string, and a subject. And let's look at what it does right here. OK. In fact the call I'm going to make, I'm not certain I'm going to be able to get away with it, my machine is still wonderfully broken, all right, it is, let me just show you what the calls would look like. As you can see here I'm not going to be able to do them. But I'm going to add teaching, as a method call with this with a string for term, and a subject number. What is this going to do? Yeah, I know I'm just worried if I restart Python, I may not be able to pull the thing back in, so I'm going to try and wing it, John, and see if I can make it happen.\nRight, what does that teaching do? It's got one of those try except methods. So what does it say it's going to do? It's going to go into the dictionary associated with teaching, under the value of term, and get out a list. And it's going to append to the end of the list the new subject. So it's going to be stored in there, is then going to be term, and a list of what I taught, in case I teach more than one thing each term. It's going to do that, but notice it's a try. If in fact there is no term currently in the dictionary, started out empty, it's going to throw an error, sorry, not throw an error, it's going to raise an exception. Which is a key error, in which case notice what I'm going to do, I'm not going to treat it as an error. I'm simply going to say, in that case, just start off with an empty, with an initial list with just that subject in and put it in the dictionary. As I add more things in, I'll just keep adding things to this dictionary under that term. And if I want to find out what I'm doing, well I can use get teaching, which says given the term, find the thing in the dictionary under that term and return it. If I get an error, I'm going to raise it, which says there is nothing for that term, and in that case I guess I'm just going to return none.\nOK? And then the other two pieces we're going to have here, and we want to look at a little more carefully, I just wanted to show you that example, is a professor can lecture, and a professor can say something. Look at the say method, because this now add one more nuance to what we want to do here. And I think in interest of making this go, let me actually, since I'm not going to get my machine to do this right, let me create a couple of professors. If I look at what that is, it's an MIT person because I didn't have any separate string thing there, and we will create a more important professor. What rank do you want, John? Do you want to stay full?\nPROFESSOR 2: Undergraduate.\nPROFESSOR: Undergraduate, right, a lot more fun I agree. Sorry about that, and we can again just see what that looks like. And that of course, we'll print out, he's also an MIT person. But now here's what I want to do. I want to say something to my good colleague Professor Guttag. Actually I'm going to start a separate -- I'm going to say something to a smart undergraduate. So if I say, remember we have ug defined as an undergraduate, let me do something a little different here. Well let, me do it that way. It says, I don't understand why you say you were enjoying 6.00. Not a good thing to say, right, but if I say to my good colleague Professor Guttag. I have to spell say right, I know, I need help with this, what can I say? We flatter each other all the time. It's part of what makes us feel good about ourselves. Why is the sky blue? I enjoyed your paper, but why is the sky blue?\nOK, terrible examples, but what's going on here? One more piece that I want to add. Here's my say method for professor, and now I'm actually taking advantage of to whom I am saying something. Notice again, what does it do? There's the self argument, that's just pointing to the instance of me. I'm passing in another argument, going to call it to who, in one case it was ug, in one case it was Guttag. And then the thing I want to say, ah, look what it does, it says, check the type. And the type is going to take that instance, I had an instance, for example, of a professor down here, and it's going to pick up what type of object it is. So if the type of the person I'm speaking to is undergrad, let's pause for second. Remember I started away back saying we're building abstract data types. Well, here's a great example of how I'm using exactly that, right? I've got int, I've got float, I now have ug, it's a type. So it's says if the object to whom I'm speaking is an undergrad, then use the same method from person where I'm going to put this on the front. On the other hand, if the object to whom I'm speaking is a professor, then I'm going to tag this on the front and use the underlying say method. On the other hand, if I'm speaking to somebody else, I'm just going to go lecture. All right, and when a professor lectures, they just put it's obvious on the end of things, as you may have noticed.\nWhat's the point I want you to see here? I'm now using the instances to help me to find what the code should do. I'm looking at the type. If the type is this, do that. If the type is this, do something different, ok? And I can now sort of build those pieces up. OK, I said one more class. Notice what we're doing. I know they're silly examples, but, sorry, they are cleverly designed examples to highlight key points. What I'm trying to do is show you how we have methods inherit methods, how have message shadow methods, how we have methods override methods, how we can use instances as types to define what the method should do.\nLet me show you one last class, because I'm gonna have one more piece that we want to use. And the last class is, sort of, once you've got a set of professors, you can have an aggregate of them. And I don't know, if a group of geese are gaggle, I don't know what a set of professors are, John. Flamers? I, you know, we've got to figure out what the right collective noun here is. We're going to call them a faculty for lack of a better term, right? Now the reason I want to show you this example is, this class, notice, it only is going to inherit from object. It actually makes sense. This is going to be a collection of things, but it's not a subclass of a particular kind of person. And what I want the faculty to do, is to be able to gather together a set of faculty. So if I go down here, grab this for second, and pull it down so you can see it. It looks like I'm not going to be able to run this because my machine is broken, but basically I'm gonna define a set of professors, and then I'm gonna create a new class called faculty. There's the definition of it. It's got an init. You can kind of see what it does. It's going to set up an internal variable called names, which is initially an empty list, internal variable called ids, which is empty, an internal variable called members, which is empty, and another special variable called place, which we're going to come back to in a second, initially bound to none.\nOK, I've got a method called add which I'm going to use down here to add professors to the course 6 faculty. Here's what I want to add to do. First of all, notice I'm going to check the type. If this is not a professor, I'm gonna raise an error, a type error, it's the wrong type of object to pass in. The second thing I'm gonna do is say, if that's okay, then let me go off and get the id number. Now remember, that's right up here, so I'm asking the instance of the professor to go up and get the id number. And I want to make sure I only have one instance of each professor in my faculty, so if the id number is in the list of ids already, I'm going to raise an error, sorry, raise an exception as well, saying I've got a duplicate id. OK? And the reason that's going to come up is, notice what I do now. Inside of the instant self, I take the variable names and I add to it the family name of the person I just added. OK, notice the form. I'm using the method, there's the parens to get the family name of the person. I'm just adding it to the list. I've got the id number, I've added the ids, and I add the object itself into members. So as I do this, what am I doing? I'm creating a list, actually several lists: a list of ids, a list of the actual instances, and a list of the family names. And as a cost I want to add, that's why I can check and see, is this in here already or not?\nNow, the last reason I want to do this is, I want to be able to support things like that. This is now different, right, this instance is a collection. I want to be able to do things like, for all the things in that collection, do something, like print out the family names. And to do that, I need two special forms: iter and next. OK, now let me see if I can say this cleanly. Whenever I use a for, in structure, even if it was on just a normal list you built, what Python is doing is returning an, what is called an iterator. Which is something that we talked earlier. It's keeping track of where are you in the list, and how do I get to the next thing in the list?\nI'm going to do the same thing here, and I'm going to create it for this particular structure. So this little thing iter, when I call a for something in, one of these instances, it calls iter, and notice what it does. It initializes place to 0. That was that variable I had up there. That's basically saying I'm at the beginning of the list. It's a pointer to the beginning of the list, and it returns self. Just gives me back a pointer to the instance. That now allows me at each step in that loop to call next. And what does next do? Next says, check to see if that value is too long, if it's longer than, for example, the list of names, raise an exception called stop iteration, which the for loop will use to say OK, I'm done. I'm going to break out of the for loop. Otherwise, what am I going to do? I'll increment place by 1, that's going to move me to the next place in the list, and then in this case I'll just return the instance itself, right? Members is a list of instances, place I've incremented by 1, I take 1 off of it, I get to it. So iter and next work together. Iter creates this method, that's going to give you a pointer to the place in the structure, and then next literally walks along the structure giving you the next element and returning elements in turn so you can do something with it.\nRight, so now what that says is, I can have classes that just have local variables. I can have classes that get methods from other variables, and I can also have classes that are collections. And I've supported that by adding in this last piece. OK once you have all of that, in principle we could start doing some fun things. So let's see what happens if we try and make all of this go. And let me, since I'm not going to be able to run it, let me simply do it this way. If I have my undergraduate, ug. I can -- sorry, let's not do it that way -- I can have undergraduate say things like -- all right, what did I just do wrong here? Do I not have undergrad defined? I do. Oh, I didn't have Grimson, sorry, it's me, isn't it? Thank you. The undergraduate very politely asks why he didn't understand, you can have the professor respond. Again, it simply puts a different thing into there. On the other hand, if Professor Guttag asks me something about understanding, I say I really like this paper on, you do not understand, it's a deep paper on programming languages 5, I think, John, isn't it? What else can you do with this thing, right? You can have an undergraduate talk to an undergraduate, in which case they're still polite. Or you could have -- sorry, let me do that the other way -- you could also have an undergraduate simply talk to a normal person. All right, but the good news is you know eventually you get it done, and when you're really done you can have the undergraduate be really happy about this, and so she sings to herself.\nOK it's a little silly, but notice what we've just illustrated. And this is where I want to pull it together. With a simple set of classes, and the following abilities, an ability to inherit methods from subclasses, sorry from superclasses, that is having this hierarchy of things. I can create a fairly complex kind of interaction. I can take advantage of the types of the objects to help me decide what to do. And if you think about that, I know it sounds very straightforward, but you would do exactly that if you were writing earlier code to deal with some numerical problem. All right, if the thing is an integer, do this, if it's a float, do that, if it's a string, do something else. I'm now giving you exactly the same ability, but the types now can be things that you could create. And what I've also got is now the ability to inherit those methods as they go up the chain. So another way of saying it is, things that you want to come away from here, are, in terms of these classes. We now have this idea of encapsulation. I'm gathering together data that naturally belongs as a unit, and I'm gathering together with it methods that apply to that unit. Just like we would have done with float or int. Ideally, we data hide, we don't happen to do it here, which is too bad.\nBasically we've got the idea of encapsulation. The second thing we've got is this idea of inheritance. Inheritance both meaning I can inherit attributes or field values. I can inherit methods by moving up the chain. I can also the shadow or override methods, so that I can specialise. And I do all of that with this nice hierarchy of classes. So what hopefully you've seen, between these two lectures, and we're going to come back to it in some subsequent lectures, is that this is now a different way of just structuring a computational system. Now, you'll also get arguments, polite arguments from faculty members or other experts about which is a better way of doing it. So I'll give you my bias, Professor Guttag will give you his bias next time around. My view, object-oriented system are great when you're trying to model systems that consist of a large number of units that interact in very specific ways. So, modeling a system of people's a great idea. Modeling a system of molecules is probably a great idea. Modeling a system where it is natural to associate things together and where the number of interactions between them is very controlled. These systems work really well. And we'll see some examples of that next week.

{"text":"February is National Teen Dating Violence Awareness & Prevention Month\nDid you know that in a recent national survey, 1 in 10 teens reported being hit or physically hurt on purpose by a boyfriend or girlfriend at least once in the 12 months prior to the survey? And nearly half of all teens in relationships say they know friends who have been verbally abused.\nBefore violence starts, a teen may experience controlling behavior and demands. One partner may tell another what to wear and who to hang out with. Over time, the unhealthy behavior may become violent. That's why adults need to talk to teens now about the importance of developing healthy, respectful relationships.\nDating violence can have a negative effect on health throughout life. Victims of teen dating violence are more likely to do poorly in school, and report binge drinking, suicide attempts, physical fighting, and current sexual activity. Teens who perpetrate dating violence may also carry these patterns of violence into future relationships.\nCDC's Division of Violence Prevention is leading the initiative, Dating Matters\u2122: Strategies to Promote Healthy Teen Relationships. Dating Matters\u2122 aims to promote respectful, nonviolent dating relationships among youth in high-risk, urban communities. The comprehensive approach will build upon current evidence-based practice and experience to reduce the burden of teen dating violence in these communities. The initiative will support communities as they implement prevention strategies in schools, with families, and in neighborhoods.\nOver the next five years, Dating Matters\u2122 will be implemented in middle schools and neighborhoods across Chicago, Illinois, Baltimore, Maryland, Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, and Oakland, California. For more information about each of these communities, view the Dating Matters\u2122 grantee profiles.\nLearn more about CDC's efforts to prevent dating violence:\nGet email updates\nTo receive email updates about this page, enter your email address:\n- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n1600 Clifton Rd\nAtlanta, GA 30333\nTTY: (888) 232-6348\n- Contact CDC-INFO","id":"<urn:uuid:d27e0ac9-9661-4138-8e0c-1155b80b1d6f>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/Features\/DatingViolence\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9215045571,"token_count":402,"score":3.28125,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Earth Day was officially on 22 April, but in many communities and countries around the world it\u2019s celebrated for the entire week or month. Earth Day was founded 40 years ago by U.S. Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin. His goal was to create a grassroots movement that would show the government just how concerned Americans were about the environment and get laws enacted that would enforce protection of the earth and its inhabitants \u2013 us.\nBy the end of that year, in December 1970, the Environmental Protection Agency opened its doors. A very good start.\nSince that time, there have been many years when there has been little to celebrate. Although there has been continual progress, including some milestones, there have also been pretty serious setbacks. For example, of the 80,000 chemicals that have been produced and used in the U.S. since the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) was enacted 34 years ago, only 200 have been tested by the EPA, and only five have been regulated.\nBut in the last year, the EPA has undergone some equally serious reform. Finally, the agency is really buckling down on toxic chemicals, both in the environment and in consumer goods.\nThere is special attention on children, as it should be. Children are most susceptible to toxic chemicals because their bodies are still growing. In the not too distant future, it is our children and grandchildren, the little ones asleep in their cribs right now, who will lead the way in politics, as teachers, as firefighters, artists, business owners and so on, and so on.\nTo do their jobs well, to achieve their goals and have a satisfying, happy and productive life, they need to be healthy.\nAt Naturepedic, we celebrate Earth Day every day. We give children a healthy start in life by manufacturing our award-winning organic baby crib mattresses that are certified by GREENGUARD and enjoy the unique distinction of being the only crib mattress recommended by Healthy Child Healthy World.\nDo you have a Naturepedic mattress for your infant or toddler? If not, you might want to celebrate Earth Day\/Week\/Month by checking them out at http:\/\/www.Naturepedic.com.\nYou can also celebrate Earth Day by working on creating a personal environment that is more chemical-free.

{"text":"Like the Republican party, the Democratic party also cracked beneath the weight of the issues at hand. States that favored slavery in the territories walked out of the Democratic convention at Charleston, preventing nominee Stephen Douglas from winning the party endorsement. A reconvened convention eventually nominated Douglas, but kept territory slavery out of the platform altogether.\nAs a result of disagreements over the issue of slavery, splinter parties formed. The Southern Democratic Party spun off from traditional Democrats to nominate John Breckenridge, an advocate of slavery in the West. Republican breakaways formed the Constitutional Union Party. They nominated John Bell who would not address the issue of slavery at all, but rather spoke of upholding the Constitution.\nWith four candidates in the race, Lincoln won the 1860 election. But by the time he took office in March of 1861, seven southern states had already seceded from the Union. When the first shot rang out at Fort Sumter, just one month after Lincoln took office, the Civil War began. Lincoln's hopes for peacefully preserving the union were dashed. In 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. He also promoted a Constitutional Amendment to permanently abolish slavery. These bold steps marked a shift from Lincoln's more moderate campaign position on slavery issues. They also shifted the focus of the war from preserving the union to freeing the slaves.\nRemarkably, the election of 1864 was not suspended during the bloody Civil War. Union soldiers were given absentee ballots or furloughed to permit them to vote. With mounting Union victories, the votes of soldiers and the campaign slogan, \"Don't switch horses in mid-stream,\" Lincoln won the election. Sadly, as this 1864 campaign song strangely foreshadows, Lincoln did not live to see passage of the 13th Amendment that abolished slavery forever. He was assassinated just five days after Ulysses S. Grant celebrated victory over Robert E. Lee at Appomattox.\nLincoln's presidency causes one to wonder:\n- Why he changed his position on the issue of abolition during his presidency?\n- Whether these changes might affect the way we view his original platform?\n- What were Lincoln's priorities when he created his original platform? How did the advent and progress of the war affect these priorities?\n- To what extent did Lincoln's original platform represent his personal views? To what extent did it reflect a desire and strategy to win the presidency?\n- If YOU were running for president, how would you balance your own opinions with the need to appeal to party and popular opinion?","id":"<urn:uuid:13028e4a-e4c5-477c-ac63-506fc2400ab6>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.loc.gov\/teachers\/classroommaterials\/presentationsandactivities\/presentations\/elections\/issues3.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9715380669,"token_count":515,"score":3.875,"int_score":4}
{"text":"Refraction and Acceleration\nName: Christopher S.\nWhy is it that when light travels from a more dense to a\nless dense medium, its speed is higher? I've read answers to this\nquestion in your archives but, sadly, still don't get it. One answer\n(Jasjeet S Bagla) says that we must not ask the question because light is\nmassless, hence questions of acceleration don't make sense. It does,\nhowever, seem to be OK to talk about different speeds of light. If you\nstart at one speed and end at a higher one, why is one not allowed to\ntalk about acceleration? Bagla goes on to say that it depends on how the\nem fields behave in a given medium. It begs the question: what is it\nabout, say, Perspex and air that makes light accelerate, oops, travel at\ndifferent speeds? If you're dealing with the same ray of light, one is\nforced to speak of acceleration, no? What other explanation is there for\nfinal velocity>initial velocity? Arthur Smith mentioned a very small\n\"evanescent\" component that travels ahead at c. Where can I learn more\nabout this? Sorry for the long question. I understand that F=ma and if\nthere is no m, you cannot talk about a, but, again, you have one velocity\nhigher than another for the same thing. I need to know more than \"that's\njust the way em fields are!\"\nAn explanation that satisfies me relates to travel through an interactive\nmedium. When light interacts with an atom, the photon of light is absorbed\nand then emitted. For a moment, the energy of the light is within the atom.\nThis causes a slight delay. Light travels at the standard speed of light\nuntil interacting with another atom. It is absorbed and emitted, causing\nanother slight delay. The average effect is taking more time to travel a\nmeter through glass than through air. This works like a slower speed. An\nindividual photon does not actually slow down. It gets delayed repeatedly by\nthe atoms of the medium. A more dense medium has more atoms per meter to\nDr. Ken Mellendorf\nIllinois Central College\nCongratulations! on not being willing to accept \"that is just the way em\nfields are!\" The answer to your inquiry is not all that simple (my opinion),\nbut I won't try to do so in the limited space allowed here, not to say my\nown limitations of knowledge.\nLike so many \"simple\" physics questions, I find the most lucid, but\naccurate, explanation in\nRichard Feynman's, \"Lectures on Physics\" which most libraries will have.\nVolume I, Chapter 31-1 through 31-6, which describes refraction, dispersion,\ndiffraction. The \"answer\" has to do with how matter alters the electric\nfield of incident radiation, but I won't pretend to be able to do a better\njob than Feynman.\nThe answer is that you are not dealing with the same ray of light. In\nvacuum a photon just keeps going at the speed of light. In a medium,\nhowever, it interacts with the atoms, often being absorbed while bumping\nan atomic or molecular motion into a higher energy state. The excited\natom\/molecule then can jump to a lower energy state, emitting a photon\nwhile doing so. This can obviously make light appear to travel slower in a\nIn detail, it is a very complicated question, requiring at least a\ngraduate course in electromagnetism to begin to understand. Why, for\nexample do the emitted photons tend to travel in the same direction?\nBest, Richard J.

It was coined by Bill James, who is one of its pioneers and is often considered its most prominent advocate and public face.\nGeneral principles \nThe Sabermetric Manifesto by David Grabiner (1994) begins:\nBill James defined sabermetrics as \"the search for objective knowledge about baseball.\" Thus, sabermetrics attempts to answer objective questions about baseball, such as \"which player on the Red Sox contributed the most to the team's offense?\" or \"How many home runs will Ken Griffey hit next year?\" It cannot deal with the subjective judgments which are also important to the game, such as \"Who is your favorite player?\" or \"That was a great game.\"\nIt may, however, attempt to settle questions such as \"Was Willie Mays faster than Mickey Mantle?\" by establishing several possible parameters for examining speed in objective studies (how many triples each man hit, how many bases each man stole, how many times he was caught stealing) and then reaching a tentative conclusion on the basis of these individual studies.\nSabermetricians frequently question traditional measures of baseball skill. For instance, they doubt that batting average is as useful as conventional wisdom says it is because team batting average provides a relatively poor fit for team runs scored. Sabermetric reasoning would say that runs win ballgames, and that a good measure of a player's worth is his ability to help his team score more runs than the opposing team. This may imply that the traditional RBI (runs batted in) is an effective metric; however, sabermetricians also reject RBI, for a number of reasons. Rather, sabermetric measures are usually phrased in terms of either runs or team wins. For example, a player might be described as being worth 54 offensive runs more than a replacement-level player at the same position over the course of a full season, as the sabermetric statistic VORP can indicate.\nSabermetrics is concerned both with determining the value of a player or team in current or past seasons and with attempting to predict the value of a player or team in the future. Many areas of study are still in development, specifically in the area of performance measurement.\nEarly history \nSabermetrics research began in the middle of the 20th century. Earnshaw Cook was one of the earliest researchers of sabermetrics. Cook gathered the majority of his research in his 1964 book, Percentage Baseball. The book was the first of its kind to gain national media attention, although it was widely criticized and not accepted by most baseball organizations.\n- Base runs (BsR)\n- Batting average on balls in play (BABIP)\n- Defense independent pitching statistics (DIPS)\n- Defensive Runs Saved (DRS)\n- Equivalent average (EQA)\n- Fantasy batter value (FBV)\n- Late-inning pressure situations (LIPS)\n- On-base plus slugging (OPS)\n- PECOTA (Player empirical comparison and optimization test algorithm)\n- Peripheral ERA (PERA)\n- Pythagorean expectation\n- Range factor\n- Runs created\n- Secondary average\n- Similarity score\n- Speed Score\n- Super linear weights\n- Total player rating, or Batter-Fielder Wins (TPR, BFW); Total Pitcher Index, or Pitcher Wins (TPI, PW)\n- Ultimate zone rating (UZR)\n- Value over replacement player (VORP)\n- Win shares\n- Wins above replacement (WAR)\nNotable proponents \n- Russ Brandon: Team President and CEO of the Buffalo Bills is going to incorporate Sabermetrics to contracts, and use in conjunction with scouting and player analysis beginning in 2013.\n- Sandy Alderson: Former General Manager of the Oakland Athletics, Alderson began focusing on sabermetric principles toward obtaining relatively undervalued players in 1995. He became GM of the New York Mets in late 2010.\n- Billy Beane: Athletics' General Manager since 1997. Although not a public proponent of sabermetrics, it has been widely noted that Beane has steered the team during his tenure according to sabermetric principles. In 2003, Michael Lewis published Moneyball about Billy Beane's use of a more quantitative approach. In 2011, a film based on Lewis' book which dramatised Beane's use of sabermetrics was released, starring Brad Pitt in the role of Beane.\n- Carson Cistulli: Senior editor of FanGraphs, member of the BBWAA\n- Earnshaw Cook: Early researcher and proponent of statistical baseball research. His 1964 book Percentage Baseball was the first book of baseball statistics studies to gain national media attention.\n- Paul DePodesta: A key figure in Michael Lewis' book Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game as Beane's assistant in Oakland.\n- Theo Epstein: President of Baseball Operations for the Chicago Cubs. As GM of the Red Sox, Epstein hired sabermetrician Bill James.\n- Bill James: Widely considered the father of sabermetrics due to his extensive series of books, although a number of less well known SABR researchers in the early 1970s provided a foundation for his work. He began publishing his Baseball Abstracts in 1977 to study some questions about baseball he found interesting, and their eclectic mix of essays based on new kinds of statistics soon became popular with a generation of thinking baseball fans. He discontinued the Abstracts after the 1988 edition, but continued to be active in the field. His two Historical Baseball Abstract editions and Win Shares book have continued to advance the field of sabermetrics, 25 years after he began. In 2002 James was hired as a special advisor to the Boston Red Sox.\n- Christina Kahrl: Co-founder of Baseball Prospectus and current ESPN columnist, Kahrl puts an emphasis on advanced baseball analytics.\n- Sean Lahman: Created a database of baseball statistics from existing sources and in the mid-1990s made it available for free download on the Internet, providing access to statistical data in electronic form for the first time.\n- Voros McCracken: Developed a system called Defense Independent Pitching Statistics (DIPS) to evaluate a pitcher based purely on his ability.\n- Rob Neyer: Senior writer at ESPN.com and national baseball editor of SBNation and former assistant to Bill James, he has worked to popularize sabermetrics since the mid-1980s. Neyer has authored or co-authored several books about baseball, and his journalistic writing focuses on sabermetric methods for looking at baseball players' and teams' performance.\n- Joe Posnanski: A popular baseball writer and a proponent of sabermetrics.\n- Nate Silver: Writer and former managing partner of Baseball Prospectus, inventor of PECOTA. Later applied sabermetric statistical models to the study of politics, particularly elections, and published the results on his blog FiveThirtyEight (later affiliated with The New York Times).\n- David Smith: Founded Retrosheet in 1989, with the objective of computerizing the box score of every major league baseball game ever played, in order to more accurately collect and compare the statistics of the game.\n- Tom Tango: Runs the Tango on Baseball sabermetrics website. In particular, he has worked in the area of defense independent pitching statistics.\n- Eric Walker: Former aerospace engineer turned baseball writer, who played an important part in the early acceptance of sabermetrics within the Oakland Athletics organization. GM Sandy Alderson hired Walker in order to get \"some Bill James-like stuff that was proprietary to us.\"\n- Keith Woolner: Creator of VORP, or Value over Replacement Player, is a former writer for sabermetric group\/website Baseball Prospectus. He was hired in 2007 by the Cleveland Indians as their Manager of Baseball Research & Analytics.\n- Craig R. Wright: A statistician for the Texas Rangers, was the first front office employee in Major League Baseball to work under the title \"Sabermetrician.\"\n- Baseball Prospectus is an annual publication and web site produced by a group of sabermetricians who originally met over the Internet. Several Baseball Prospectus authors have invented or improved upon widely relied upon sabermetric measures and techniques. The website publishes analytical articles as well as advanced statistics and projections for individuals and teams. This group also publishes other books that use and seek to popularize sabermetric techniques, including Baseball Between the Numbers and It Ain't Over 'til It's Over.\n- The Hardball Times is a website as well as an annual volume that evaluates the preceding major league season and presents original research articles on various sabermetric topics. The website also publishes original research on baseball.\n- FanGraphs is a website that publishes advanced baseball statistics as well as graphics that evaluate and track the performance of players and teams. The site also favors the analysis of play-by-play data and PITCHf\/x. It draws on some of the advanced baseball metrics developed by well-known sabermetricians such as Tom Tango and Mitchel Lichtman.\n- Beyond the Boxscore is a part of SB Nation and specializes in sabermetric analysis and research. It has also launched the careers of many successful sabermetricians.\n- SABR is the Society for American Baseball Research, founded in 1971, and the root of the term sabermetrics. Statistical study, however, is only a small component of SABR members' research, which also focuses on diverse issues including ballparks, the Negro Leagues, rules changes, and the desegregation of baseball as a mirror of American culture.\n- Fielding Bible Awards are voted on by a panel of sabermetically inclined writers to recognize the best defensive player for each fielding position. It provides an alternative to the Gold Glove Awards, the traditional measurement of fielding excellence.\n- Baseball Think Factory is a web forum that includes extensive coverage of and commentary on baseball, usually from the perspective of sabermetrics.\nPopular culture \n- Moneyball, the 2011 film about Billy Beane's use of sabermetrics to build the Oakland Athletics. The film is based on Michael Lewis' book of the same name.\n- The season 3 Numb3rs episode \"Hardball\" focuses on sabermetrics, and the season 1 episode \"Sacrifice\" also covers the subject.\n- \"MoneyBART\", the third episode of The Simpsons' 22nd season, in which Lisa utilizes sabermetrics to coach Bart's Little League Baseball team.\nSee also \n- Fielding Bible Award\n- Win Shares by Bill James\n- Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame? by Bill James\n- Total Baseball by John Thorn and Pete Palmer\n- The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract\n- Moneyball, by Michael Lewis\n- APBRmetrics, the basketball equivalent\n- Lewis, Michael M.

{"text":"This is the time of year Gulf Coast residents begin watching the weather reports to see if there is a storm and if it is heading their way.\nIt would be wise if we watched, as well. And prepared accordingly.\nThink back to October 1995, when Hurricane Opal hit the Florida Panhandle. It remained a hurricane for the next 12 hours as it roared deep into Alabama. Fifty mph winds were felt as far north as Montgomery. Anniston got more than six inches of rain in a few hours. Power outages erupted throughout the state. The system spun off tornadoes and caused extensive damage all the way to Tennessee.\nMore recently, Hurricane Ivan, which made landfall near Gulf Shores in September 2004, sent the wind gusting at more than 60 mph in central Alabama and caused more power outages, more tornados and more rain.\nNow Ernesto is taking aim at the Gulf Coast.\nAlthough Alabama is not currently in the cone of uncertainty, anyone who follows the weather knows hurricanes can change course. Our ability to predict where and when a storm will strike improves every year, but it is still an imperfect science.\nHowever, this much we do know: It is better to be prepared, just in case.\nWhen serious weather looms, make sure you have working flashlights and a weather radio with plenty of batteries.

{"text":"Nursing a critically ill state back to health\n|Indranill Basu Ray highlights the core problems that afflict Bengal's health sector and suggests a few ways to improve the situation|\nDespite many technological and other achievements that have propelled India from being a developing nation to one of the top economies of the world, one field that India continues to lag behind in is health. This is why stories of babies dying in large numbers haunt newspaper headlines. India is behind Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in life expectancy at birth or under-five mortality level. India accounts for about 17 per cent of the world population, but it contribute to a fifth of the world's share of diseases. A third of all diarrhoeal diseases in the world occurs in India. The country has the second largest number of HIV\/AIDS cases after South Africa. It is home to one-fifth of the world's population afflicted with diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.\nA common excuse that I often hear is that we have limited resources to tackle the huge and burgeoning health problems. But even the richest country on earth, the United States of America, has failed to provide appropriate health services to a large section of the populace. The problem in India is quite different. Apart from being a poor nation with limited resources, it also has a sizeable population in need of basic health services. Furthermore, the lack of appropriate sanitary measures and education ensures an ever increasing presence of communicable disease that have been controlled and even eradicated in the developed nations.\nIndia's list of woes does not stop here. Lack of foresight on the part of successive governments and selective and fragmented strategies to counter daily problems without a definite public health goal have been the mainstay of India's health policies. Resource allocation to this sector is influenced by the prevailing fiscal situation as well as by the priorities of the reigning government. Unfortunately, in Bengal \u2014 a state that faces a dismal fiscal situation \u2014 the government's priorities have been skewed as a result of political necessities. Although we have a new government at the helm, it is important to realize that gross changes at the practical level cannot be initiated without having a team with experience and knowledge define a well-thought-out strategy. It is also essential to have a government that is willing to fulfil the financial needs necessary for the strategy to work.\nIt is difficult, if not impossible, to paint a picture of the present state of public health in West Bengal and to suggest measures to rectify the same in a short article like this. My intention is to highlight the core problems plaguing the system and to suggest solutions based on accepted principles of public health and healthcare management. The steps that need to be taken are as follows: reducing disease burden, including infectious diseases as well as non-communicable epidemics like diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease; restructuring the existing primary healthcare system to make it more accountable; creating a skilled and professional workforce which is quality driven; financial planning to bring more investment to the health sector.\nReducing disease burden is the cornerstone of any good health policy. The factors that help reduce communicable diseases are clean drinking water, improved sanitation and an effective vaccination programme. A paradigm shift, from the prevalent curative approach to a preventive approach, including health promotion by inculcating behavioural changes, is imperative to reduce disease burden. West Bengal is one of four states that urgently needs high investment in safe drinking water and toilet facilities. It is estimated that Rs 18,000 crore is required to provide effective drinking water and sanitation facilities for the entire country. Kerala, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Odisha would account for more than 60 per cent of the total outlay.\nSimilarly, a huge investment is required to provide nutritional supplements to malnourished children and pregnant and lactating mothers living below the poverty line. According to a report by the national commission on macroeconomics and health, West Bengal would need to harness an additional resource requirement of rupees (in crore) 1,286, 2,459, 4,693, 13,811 and 8,485 in sectors such as health, water and sanitation, nutrition, primary schooling and roads. It has been projected that in the next five years West Bengal will spend a large portion of its revenues on wages and salaries, interest payments and pensions, leaving very little for discretionary expenditure in the field of health. It is imperative that the present government rethink and strategize in collaboration with the Centre to ensure the appropriate funding necessary to make the state healthy.\nRestructuring the present healthcare delivery system is also equally important. Most primary healthcare centres are old, dilapidated buildings with few or no facilities. Some do not even have basic resources like healthcare workers or pharmacists. What is required is a radical overhaul of the existing system. There are differences in health systems of different countries. A State-run health system, such as the one in Canada, suffers from delayed medical care. A privately-run health system like the one in the US provides only limited health services to its poor. India's healthcare should carve out the best of both systems. Private healthcare is thriving in India. It is uncontrolled and aimed at profit-making. Government-run hospitals are poorly managed, providing few or no facilities to those living below the poverty line.\nDifferent models have been suggested to take care of this disparity. While private investment will always be geared towards profit-making, it is mandatory to rein in these bodies under well-defined rules. Large private hospitals in the US are non-profit bodies, which have to follow stringent rules in patient care. At the other end of the spectrum is the National Health Service in Britain in which small, medium and even a few large hospitals are making way for a more competent and accountable government-controlled health system with fewer hospitals.\nHuman resource management is very important in running an effective health system. One of the biggest lacunae of government health service is its poor human-resource management. Many physicians are not paid appropriate salaries or are posted in places that are not of their choice. Political intervention and favouritism play a big role in posting physicians. Consequently, dedicated physicians who want to serve the public or work in the academic setting found in government hospitals are forced to remain in private hospitals. To boost morale and efficacy, discipline needs to be instituted in the system and a transparent posting policy adopted. The doctor-population ratio needs to be improved by filling up vacancies in the West Bengal health service. It is important to free postings from the grip of bureaucrats to ensure the registration of quality candidates. Physicians failing to report to duty or indulging in indiscipline must be punished. Doctors who do sign up need to provide relevant and quality medical care. This can only be done if some form of recertification of doctors is made mandatory once every 10 years. Physicians' salaries in the state health service must be made on a par with those of the Central government to make sure that it remains a lucrative option. Senior physicians providing exemplary public service must be rewarded for the same. A commonly-held notion is that most physicians run after the lucrative salaries that are offered in private hospitals. Hence it is difficult to retain them in the government sector. This, however, is true of a minority. The majority of physicians are willing to work in a healthy, progressive and academic environment if there are appropriate non-financial incentives. Let us take the example of Christian Medical College, Vellore. Most of the faculty there are paid salaries that are much lower than those of the private sector. However, physicians are provided with other facilities such as good housing, free schools, free-to-highly-subsidized college education and, most importantly, a progressive and research oriented work environment.\nWest Bengal lags behind many other states when it comes to medical education. There is an urgent need to increase the number of medical colleges in the state. Private investment for the same should be welcomed but appropriate laws must be instituted so that huge capitation fees are not charged for seats. Furthermore, selection should be made through competitive examinations. A certain percentage of seats can be reserved for the economically weaker sections. Students passing out of such medical colleges must be given postings in rural hospitals. This has been true on paper for many decades now, but the rule has been poorly implemented even in government-run medical colleges.\nInnovative schemes ought to be thought of to involve the cash-rich private sector to service the medical needs of the state. Private institutions using government money or land must be asked to provide free service to 20 per cent of their capacity. Appropriate punitive measures \u2014 such as temporarily withholding or cancelling licences \u2014 can be taken when a private institution fails to honour this commitment. Institutions willing to set up large hospitals, particularly around Calcutta, must be helped through the provision of low-cost land. But in return, promises to set up satellite hospitals in far-flung district headquarters have to be met.\nThe biggest challenge to the rejuvenation of the healthcare system is the garnering of funds. West Bengal is financially broke, thanks to the misrule of the communists. Unlike most other communist rulers, our home-grown variants failed to provide basic sanitation, good roads, a working healthcare system and appropriate nutritional supplements to women and children. The lack of social services resulted in poor health and in increased mortality among the vulnerable sections of society. Government efforts to improve basic health services must fund programmes that provide sanitation, nutritional supplements, and daily meals for school-going children. Substantial investments in these sectors can reduce mortality in children. It is popular to blame doctors for not being able to save severely ill, malnourished children. But things won't change unless determined steps are taken to root out the problems, such as poor funds, minimal resources and an incompetent workforce, that affect the West Bengal health service.\nIn the next five years, in collaboration with the Centre and the non-government organizations involved in public health, the state government must chalk out a definitive strategy to improve the supply of clean drinking water, provide better sanitation and one full meal to school-going children and arrange for nutritional supplements to pregnant women. Private investment should be wooed in the health sector to set up hospitals in large metropolitan areas as well as in small district towns. While government land is needed at an appropriate price to help investors build hospitals, steps must be taken to bring about the inclusion of the deprived sections in their service plans. Strong regulatory bodies that can monitor private hospitals and nursing homes must be instituted. Many of the profiteering health institutions do not provide basic facilities, lack trained nurses and paramedical staff, and some are even run by quacks without medical degrees. It is of utmost importance that a regulatory body conducts surprise checks on these institutions, registers complaints and takes remedial steps.\nMany NGOs have been able to set up large projects benefiting thousands of people. They have also succeeded in bringing foreign aid to tackle malaria and HIV. The state government should help these NGOs achieve their goals while exercising control to prevent financial irregularities. Their services ought to be applauded and single-window processing of applications instituted to help them tackle bureaucratic delays. Health is a service industry and not a lucrative business. Unfortunately, in Bengal, most large hospitals are owned by corporates. Only a few are owned or run by doctors. There is thus a sustained effort to make profit. Poor consumer protection makes the man on the street vulnerable to substandard service at high prices.\nThese are trying times for Bengal, after years of mismanagement in the health sector. It is important for the present rulers to rectify the situation by laying down the stepping stones for a better tomorrow.\nTuesday, November 22, 2011\nNursing a critically ill state back to health Indranill Basu Ray highlights the core problems that afflict Bengal\u2019s health sector and suggests a few ways to improve the situation","id":"<urn:uuid:a51737a0-6a1a-4721-a739-791f50bfecba>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/basantipurtimes.blogspot.com\/2011\/11\/nursing-critically-ill-state-back-to.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9593021274,"token_count":2399,"score":2.703125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"What is bone cancer?\nBone is the framework that supports the body. Most bones are hollow. Bone marrow is the soft tissue inside hollow bones. The main substance of bone is made up of a network of fibrous tissue onto which calcium salts are laid down. This makes the bone very hard and strong. At each end of the bone is a softer bone-like tissue called cartilage that acts as a cushion between bones. The outside of the bone is covered with a layer of fibrous tissue.\nThe bone itself contains 2 kinds of cells. Osteoblasts are cells that form the bone. Osteoclasts are cells that dissolve bone. Although we think that bone does not change, the truth is that it is very active. New bone is always forming and old bone dissolving.\nThe marrow of some bones is only fatty tissue. In other bones the marrow is a mixture of fat cells and the cells that make blood cells. These blood-forming cells make red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\nTypes of bone tumors\nMost of the time when someone is told they have cancer in their bones, the doctor is talking about a cancer that started somewhere else and then spread to the bone. This is called metastatic cancer (not bone cancer). This can happen to people with many different types of advanced cancer, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and many others. Under a microscope, theses cancer cells in the bone look like the cancer cells that they came from. If someone has lung cancer that has spread to the bone, the cells there will look and act like lung cancer cells and they will be treated the same way.\nTo learn more about cancer that has spread to bone, please see the American Cancer Society document Bone Metastasis, as well as the document on the place where the cancer started (Breast Cancer, Lung Cancer (Non-Small Cell), Prostate Cancer, etc.).\nOther kinds of cancers that are sometimes called \u201cbone cancers\u201d start in the bone marrow \u2013 in the blood-forming cells \u2013 not the bone itself. These are not true bone cancers. The most common of these is multiple myeloma. Certain lymphomas (which more often start in lymph nodes) and all leukemias start in bone marrow. To learn more about these cancers, refer to the document for each.\nA primary bone tumor starts in the bone itself. True (or primary) bone cancers are called sarcomas. A sarcoma is a cancer that starts in bone, muscle, tendons, ligaments, fat tissue, or some other tissues in the body.\nThere are different types of bone tumors. Their names are based on the bone or tissue that is involved and the kind of cells that make up the tumor. Some are cancer (malignant). Others are not cancer (benign). Most bone cancers are called sarcomas.\nBenign bone tumors do not spread to other tissues and organs. They can usually be cured by surgery. The information here does not cover benign bone tumors.\nBone tumors that are cancer (malignant)\nOsteosarcoma: Osteosarcoma (also called osteogenic sarcoma) is the most common true bone cancer. It is most common in young people between the ages of 10 and 30. But about 10% of cases are people in their 60s and 70s. This cancer is rare during middle age. More males than females get this cancer. These tumors start most often in bones of the arms, legs, or pelvis. This type of bone cancer is not discussed in this document, but is covered in detail in our document, Osteosarcoma.\nChondrosarcoma: This is cancer of the cartilage cells. Cartilage is a softer form of bone-like tissue. Chondrosarcoma is the second most common true bone cancer. It is rare in people younger than 20. After age 20, the risk of this cancer keeps on rising until about age 75. Women get this cancer as often as men.\nChondrosarcomas can develop in any place where there is cartilage. It most often starts in cartilage of the pelvis, leg, or arm, but it can start in many other places, too.\nChondrosarcomas are given a grade, which measures how fast they grow. The lower the grade, the slower the cancer grows. When cancer grows slowly, the chance that it will spread is lower and the outlook is better. There are also some special types of chondrosarcoma that respond differently to treatment and have a different outlook for the patient. These special types look different when seen under a microscope.\nEwing tumor: This cancer is also called Ewing sarcoma. It is named after Dr. James Ewing, the doctor who first described it in 1921. It is the third most common bone cancer. Most Ewing tumors start in bones, but they can start in other tissues and organs. This cancer is most common in children and teenagers. It is rare in adults older than 30. This type of bone cancer is not discussed in this document, but is covered in detail in our document, Ewing Family of Tumors.\nMalignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH): This cancer more often starts in the soft tissues around bones (such as ligaments, tendons, fat, and muscle) rather than in the bone itself. If it starts in the bones, it most often affects the legs or arms. It usually occurs in older and middle-aged adults. MFH mostly tends to grow into nearby tissues, but it can spread to distant sites, like the lungs. (Another name for this cancer is pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma.)\nFibrosarcoma: This is another type of cancer that starts more often in \u201csoft tissues\u201d than it does in the bones. Fibrosarcoma usually occurs in older and middle-aged adults. Leg, arm, and jaw bones are most often affected.\nGiant cell tumor of bone: This type of bone tumor has both benign (not cancer) and malignant forms. The benign form is most common. These don\u2019t often spread to distant sites, but after surgery they tend to come back where they started. Each time they come back after surgery they are more likely to spread to other parts of the body. These tumors often affect the arm or leg bones of young and middle-aged adults.\nChordoma: This tumor usually occurs in the base of the skull and bones of the spine. It is found most often in adults older than 30. It is about twice as common in men than in women. Chordomas tend to grow slowly and usually do not spread to other parts of the body. But they often come back in the same place if they are not removed completely. When they do spread, they tend to go to the lymph nodes, lungs, and liver.\nLast Medical Review: 12\/05\/2012\nLast Revised: 01\/24\/2013","id":"<urn:uuid:cc6f91ff-3151-4cd9-8163-a7274ef9de2f>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.cancer.org\/cancer\/bonecancer\/overviewguide\/bone-cancer-overview-what-is-bone-cancer","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9596326947,"token_count":1460,"score":3.90625,"int_score":4}

{"text":"A risk factor is something that increases your likelihood of getting a disease or condition.\nIt is possible to develop melanoma with or without the risk factors listed below. However, the more risk factors you have, the greater your likelihood of developing melanoma. If you have a number of risk factors, ask your doctor what you can do to reduce your risk.\nRisk factors for melanoma include:\nThe occurrence of melanoma has been linked with exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Therefore, exposing your skin to UV rays from the sun or tanning lamps increases your odds of developing melanoma. People who live in sunny climates are exposed to more sunlight. People who live at high altitudes, where the sunlight is strongest, are exposed to more UV radiation. Blistering sunburns, even as a child, also increase the risk of developing melanoma.\nHaving melanoma once increases your risk of developing it again.\nHaving many moles or large moles increases your risk of melanoma. Also, irregular moles are more likely to turn into melanoma than normal moles. Irregular moles are characterized by:\n- Being larger than normal moles\n- Being variable in color\n- Having irregular borders\n- Any pigmented spot in the nail beds\n- Changing in size and\/or shape\nMost melanomas are diagnosed in young adults and older adults.\nFamily members of people with melanoma are at greater risk of developing the disease than people with no family history of the disease. People with a disease called xeroderma pigmentosa (XP) are at a very increased risk of developing melanoma. This rare disease does not allow patients to repair sun-damaged DNA, therefore any sun exposure will result in damage and mutations that become melanomatous. It is not unusual for these people to develop hundreds of melanomas on their skin. Similarly, people with hereditary dysplastic nevus syndrome or familial atypical multiple mole melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome are also at increased risk for developing melanoma.\nCaucasians are more likely than black, Hispanic and Asian people to develop melanoma.\nMost people who develop melanoma tend to burn rather than tan when exposed to sunlight. These people tend to have fair skin, freckles, red or blonde hair, or blue-colored eyes.\n- Reviewer: Brian Randall, MD\n- Review Date: 04\/2013 -\n- Update Date: 04\/08\/2013 -","id":"<urn:uuid:daae388f-a51e-4b8b-9f5a-339ad966b48f>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/restonhospital.com\/your-health\/?\/19822\/Lifestyle-Changes-to-Manage-Melanoma~Risk-Factors","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9338117838,"token_count":508,"score":3.4375,"int_score":3}
{"text":"(1) The section of a pedestal between base and surbase. (2) The lower portion of the wall of a room, decorated diffrently from the upper section.\nThe dance of death, a favorite late medieval picture subject. It generally shows skeletons forcing the living to dance with them, usually in matching pairs, e.g. a live priest dancing with a skeleton priest. Holbein's woodcut series the Dance of Death is one of the most famous.\nRefers to a style of painting that developed in Regensburg, Germany, and elsewhere along the Danube river during the Renaissance and Reformation. It is characterized by a renewed interest in medieval piety, an expressive use of nature, the relationship of the human figure and events to nature, and the introduction of landscape as a primary theme in art. The term was coined by Theodor von Frimmel (1853-1928), who believed that painting in the Danube River region around Regensburg, Passau, and Linz possessed common characteristics; the style seems to exist even though leading artists did not form a school in the usual sense of the term, since they did not work in a single workshop or in a particular centre. Major artists whose work represents the style include Lucas Cranach the Elder, Albrecht Altdorfer and Wolf Huber.\na minister who was below the rank of priest in the Catholic, Anglican and Orthodox churches. Deacons originally cared for both the sick and the poor in early Christian communities.\nthe representation of Christ enthroned in glory as judge or ruler of the world, flanked by the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist acting as intercessors.\nin medieval art a picture, often an altarpiece, consisting of two folding wings without a fixed central area.\nIn Renaissance art theory, the design of a painting seen in terms of drawing, which was help to be the basis of all art. The term stresses not the literal drawing, but the concept behind an art work. With the Mannerists the term came to mean an ideal image that a work attempts to embody but can in fact never fully realize. As disegno appeals to the intellect, it was considered far more important that coloure (colour), which was seen as appealing to the senses and emotions.\nA technique of painting in which pigments are diluted with water and bound with a glue. It was usually used for painting wall decorations and frescoes, though a few artists, notably Andrea Mantegna (1430\/31-1506), also used it on canvas.\nin architecture, hemispherical structure evolved from the arch, usually forming a ceiling or roof.\nA Roman Catholic order of mendicant friars founded by St. Dominic in 1216 to spread the faith through preaching and teaching. The Dominicans were one of the most influential religious orders in the later Middle Ages, their intellectual authority being established by such figures as Albertus Magnus and St.Thomas Aquinas. The Dominicans played the leading role in the Inquisition.\na patron who commissioned a work of art for a church. Donors sometimes had their portraits included in the work they were donating as a sign of piety.\nA male garment, formerly worn under armour, that from the 15th century referred to a close-fitting jacket.\nA ceramic product invented in England around 1720, which belongs to the category of fine stoneware. The porous white bodies are made of fired raw materials containing clay and kaolin as well as quartz, feldspar, and talc. A transparent glaze is applied upon the first or second firing. Earthenware, which is suitable for everyday use, is distinguished by its light, creamy surface. The most famous example of this category is made by the English firm of Wedgwood (since 1780).\nStand on which a painting is supported while the artist works on it. The oldest representation of an easel is on an Egyptian relief of the Old Kingdom (c. 2600-2150 BC). Renaissance illustrations of the artist at work show all kinds of contrivances, the commonest being the three-legged easel with pegs, such as we still use today. Light folding easels were not made until the 18th and 19th centuries, when painters took to working out of doors. The studio easel, a 19th-century invention, is a heavy piece of furniture, which runs on castors or wheels, and served to impress the c1ients of portrait painters. Oil painters need an easel which will support the canvas almost vertically or tip it slightly forward to prevent reflection from the wet paint, whereas the watercolourist must be able to lay his paper nearly flat so that the wet paint will not run down. The term 'easel-painting' is applied to any picture small enough to have been painted on a standard easel.\nThe words of Pontius Pilate in the Gospel of St. John (19, 5) when he presents Jesus to the crowds. Hence, in art, a depiction of Jesus, bound and flogged, wearing a crown of thorns and a scarlet robe.\nIn portraiture, a pose in which the sitter faces the viewer directly; full face.\nColoured glass in powder form and sometimes bound with oil, which is bonded to a metal surface or plaque by firing.\nA print made from a metal plate that has had a design cut into it with a sharp point. Ink is smeared over the plate and then wiped off, the ink remaining in the etched lines being transferred when the plate is pressed very firmly onto a sheet of paper.\nA combining of several media grouped together to form a composite art work. Chapels were among the most notable Renaissance ensembles, sometimes combining panel painting, fresco, sculpture, and architecture.\nIn classical architecture, the part of a building between the capitals of the columns and the roof. It consists of the architrave, the frieze, and the cornice.\nPictures or tables with reliefs and inscriptions erected in honour of the deceased in churches or sepulchral chapels.\nthe science of the end of the world and beginning of a new world, and of the last things,death and resurrection.\nthe sacrament of Holy Communion, celebrated with bread and wine, the most sacred moment of the Christian liturgy.\nThe term is used in an Italian context to designate spiritual currents manifest around 1540 which might be said to have occupied the confessional middle ground between Catholicism and Protestantism; hence it does not relate at all to the term 'Evangelical' as used in German or English contexts. It has been applied particularly to the so-called spirituali of the Viterbo circle, notably Cardinal Pole, Vittoria Colonna, Marcantonio Flaminio, Carnesecchi and Ochino, and also to Giulia Gonzaga, Contarini, Giovanni Morone; Gregorio Cortese and Vermigli. Such persons combined a zeal for personal religious renewal with spiritual anxieties akin to those of Luther, to which they sought an answer in the study of St Paul and St Augustine; convinced of the inefficacy of human works, they stressed the role of faith and the all-efficacy of divine grace in justification. Few of them broke with the Catholic Church.\nTin-glazed European earthenware, particularly ware made in France, Germany, Spain, and Scandinavia. It developed in France in the early 16th century, was influenced by the technique and the designs of Italian maiolica, and is named for Faenza, Italy, which was famous for maiolica. It is distinguished from tin-glazed earthenware made in Italy, which is called \"maiolica,\" and that made in the Netherlands and England, which is called \"delftware.\" It has no connection to the ancient objects or material also named faience, which was developed in the Near East ca. 4500 BCE.\nA title given to those leaders of the early Christian Church whose writings had made an important contribution to the development of doctrine. Saints Ambrose, Augustine, Jerome, and Gregory the Great were often considered the four principal Fathers of the Church.\nAncient Roman god of nature, protector of shepherds, farmers, fields and livestock. Equated with the Greek god Pan, he is frequently depicted with a goats legs and horns.\nArchitectural ornaments consisting of fruit, leaves, and flowers suspended in a loop; a swag.\nIn painting, representation of a rural feast or open-air entertainment. Although the term f\u00eate galante (\"gallant feast\") is sometimes used synonymously with f\u00eate champ\u00eatre, it is also used to refer to a specific kind of f\u00eate champ\u00eatre: a more graceful, usually aristocratic scene in which groups of idly amorous, relaxed, well-dressed figures are depicted in a pastoral setting.\nof a column or pillar, carved with closely spaced parallel grooves cut vertically.\nthe Four Horsemen in the Revelation of St John (Rev 6, 2 - 8), which contains the description of the end of the world and the Second Coming of Christ. The Horsemen personify the disasters about to happen to mankind, such as plague, war, famine and death. Their attributes are the bow, sword and set of balances. In some sculptures the first rider is identified as Christ by a halo. The colour of his horse is white, that of the others red, black and dun.\nA Roman Catholic order of mendicant friars founded by St. Francis of Assisi (given papal approval in 1223). Committed to charitable and missionary work, they stressed the veneration of the Holy Virgin, a fact that was highly significant in the development of images of the Madonna in Italian art. In time the absolute poverty of the early Franciscans gave way to a far more relaxed view of property and wealth, and the Franciscans became some of the most important patrons of art in the early Renaissance.\nWall painting technique in which pigments are applied to wet (fresh) plaster (intonaco). The pigments bind with the drying plaster to form a very durable image. Only a small area can be painted in a day, and these areas, drying to a slightly different tint, can in time be seen. Small amounts of retouching and detail work could be carried out on the dry plaster, a technique known as a secco fresco.\nSave in Venice, where the atmosphere was too damp, fresco painting was the habitual way of decorating wall surfaces in Italy, both in churches and in private and public palaces. During the 16th century a liking for the more brilliant effect of large canvases painted in oils, and to a lesser extent for tapestries, diminished the use of frescoes save for covering upper walls, covings and ceilings. The technique of buon fresco, or true fresco, involved covering the area with a medium-fine plaster, the intonaco, just rough enough to provide a bond (sometimes enhanced by scoring) for the final layer of fine plaster. Either a freehand sketch of the whole composition (sinopia) was drawn on the wall, or a full-scale cartoon was prepared and its outlines transferred to the intonaco by pressing them through with a knife or by pouncing - blowing charcoal dust through prickholes in the paper. Then over the intonaco enough of the final thin layer was applied to contain a day's work. That portion of the design was repeated on it either by the same methods or freehand, and the artist set to work with water-based pigments while the plaster was still damp; this allowed them to sink in before becoming dry and fixed. (Thus 'pulls' or slices of frescoes could be taken by later art thieves without actually destroying the colour or drawing of the work.) It is usually possible to estimate the time taken to produce a fresco by examining the joins between the plastered areas representing a day's work. Final details, or effects impossible to obtain in true fresco pigments, could be added at the end in 'dry' paints, or fresco secco, a technique in which pigment was laid on an unabsorbent plaster; the best known example of an entire composition in fresco secco is Leonardo's Last Supper.\nThe highest order the English monarch can bestow. It was founded by Edward III in 1348. The blue Garter ribbon is worn under the left knee by men and on the upper left arm by women. The motto is Honi soit qui mal y pense (Evil to those who think evil).\nin classical Rome, a person's invisible tutelary god. In art from the classical period onwards, the low-ranking god was depicted as a winged, usually childish figure.\nIn a broad sense, the term is used to mean a particular branch or category of art; landscape and portraiture, for example, are genres of painting, and the essay and the short story are genres of literature.\nThe depiction of scenes from everyday life. Elements of everyday life had long had a role in religious works; pictures in which such elements were the subject of a painting developed in the 16th century with such artists as Pieter Bruegel. Then Carracci and Caravaggio developed genre painting in Italy, but it was in Holland in the 17th century that it became an independent form with its own major achievements, Vermeer being one of its finest exponents.\nA term applied to the 14th-century followers of Giotto. The best-known of the 'Giotteschi' are the Florentines Taddeo Gaddi, Maso di Banco, Bernardo Daddi, and to a lesser extent the Master of St Cecilia. Giotto's most loyal follower was Maso, who concentrated on the essential and maintained the master's high seriousness.\nFrench term used from the 15th century onwards for a lying or recumbent effigy on a funerary monument. The gisant typically represented a person in death (sometimes decomposition) and the gisant position was contrasted with the orant, which represented the person as if alive in a kneeling or praying position. In Renaissance monuments gisants often formed part of the lower register, where the deceased person was represented as a corpse, while on the upper part he was represented orant as if alive.\npaint applied so thinly that the base beneath it is visible through the layer.\n(1) The supernatural radiance surrounding a holy person.\n(2) To have the distinction of one's deeds recognized in life and to be revered for them posthumously: this was glory. The nature of true gloria was much discussed, whether it must be connected with the public good, whether the actions that led to it must conform with Christian ethics, how it differed from notoriety. The concept did not exclude religious figures (the title of the church of the Frari in Venice was S. Maria Gloriosa), but it was overwhelmingly seen in terms of secular success and subsequent recognition, as determining the lifestyles of the potent and the form of their commemoration in literature, in portraits and on tombs. As such, it has been taken as a denial of medieval religiosity ('sic transit gloria mundi'), and thus a hallmark of Renaissance individual ism; as a formidable influence on cultural patronage; and as spurring on men of action, as well as writers and artists, to surpass their rivals - including their counterparts in antiquity.\nFrench tapestry manufactory, named after a family of dyers and clothmakers who set up business on the outskirts of Paris in the 15th century. Their premises became a tapestry factory in the early 17th century, and in 1662 it was taken over by Louis XIV, who appointed Lebrun Director. Initially it made not only tapestries but also every kind of product (except carpets, which were woven at the Savonnerie factory) required for the furnishing of the royal palaces \u2014 its official title was Manufacture royale des meubles de la Couronne. The celebrated tapestry designed by Lebrun showing Louis XIV Visiting the Gobelins (Gobelins Museum, Paris, 1663-75) gives a good idea of the range of its activities. In 1694 the factory was closed because of the king's financial difficulties, and although it reopened in 1699, thereafter it made only tapestries. For much of the 18th century it retained its position as the foremost tapestry manufactory in Europe. 0udry and Boucher successively held the post of Director (1733-70). The Gobelins continues in production today and houses a tapestry museum.\na noble chivalric order, still in existence today, founded by Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy in 1430 in honor of the Apostle Andrew, for the defence of the Christian faith and the Church. In allusion to the legend of Jason and the Argonauts, the symbol of the order is a golden ram's fleece drawn through a gold ring.\nIn painting and architecture, a formula meant to provide the aesthetically most satisfying proportions for a picture or a feature of a building. The golden section is arrived at by dividing a line unevenly so that the shorter length is to the larger as the larger is to the whole. This ratio is approximately 8:13. The golden section (sometimes known as the golden mean), which was thought to express a perfect harmony of proportions, played an important role in Renaissance theories of art.\nItalian gonfaloniere (\"standard bearer\"), a title of high civic magistrates in the medieval Italian city-states.\nIn Florence the gonfaloniers of the companies (gonfalonieri di compagnia) originated during the 1250s as commanders of the people's militia. In the 1280s a new office called the gonfalonier of justice (gonfaloniere di giustizia) was instituted to protect the interests of the people against the dominant magnate class. The holder of this office subsequently became the most prominent member of the Signoria (supreme executive council of Florence) and formal head of the civil administration. In other Italian cities, the role of the gonfaloniers was similar to that in Florence. Gonfaloniers headed the militia from the various city quarters, while the gonfalonier of justice often was the chief of the council of guild representatives.\nThe kings of France traditionally bore the title gonfalonier of St. Denis. The honorary title of gonfalonier of the church (vexillifer ecclesiae) was conferred by the popes, from the 13th until the 17th century, on sovereigns and other distinguished persons.\nGothic, which may well have originated with Alberti as a derogatory term and which certainly corresponds to Vasari's 'maniera tedesca' ('German style'), is properly the descriptive term for an artistic style which achieved its first full flowering in the Ile de France and the surrounding areas in the period between c. 1200 and c. 1270, and which then spread throughout northern Europe. It is characterized by the hitherto unprecedented integration of the arts of sculpture, painting, stained glass and architecture which is epitomized in the great cathedrals of Chartres, Amiens, and Reims or in the Sainte Chapelle in Paris. In all the arts the predominantly planar forms of the Romanesque are replaced by an emphasis on line. There is a transcendental quality, whether in the soaring forms of the pointed arches or in the new stress on the humanity of Christ, which similarly distinguishes it from the preceding Romanesque style.\nIn thinking of Nicola (d. c. 1284) or Giovanni Pisano (d. after 1314) there is same danger of forgetting what had happened in French sculpture half a century or more earlier, and likewise it is hard to remember that the spectacular achievements of early Renaissance art are a singularly localized eddy in the continuing stream of late gothic European art. By northern European standards few Italian works of art can be called gothic without qualification, and the story of 13th and 14th century Italian architecture is as much one of resistance to the new style as of its reception, whether directly from France or through German or central European intermediaries. In sculpture and in painting, the Italian reluctance to distort the human figure, conditioned by a never wholly submerged awareness of the omnipresent antique heritage, gives a special quality to the work of even those artists such as Giovanni Pisano or Simone Martini who most closely approached a pure gothic style.\nNevertheless, the vitalizing role of Northern gothic art throughout the early Renaissance and the period leading up to it should never be underestimated. The artistic, like the cultural and commercial, interaction was continuous and much of the Italian achievement is incomprehensible if seen in isolation. It is not merely at the level of direct exchanges between one artist and another, or the influence of one building; painting, manuscript or piece of sculpture upon another, that the effects are to be felt. The streaming quality of line which is so characteristic of Brunelleschi's early Renaissance architecture surely reflects a sensitivity to the gothic contribution which is entirely independent of, and lies much deeper than, the superficial particularities of form.\nThe counterflow of influence and inspiration from South to North must likewise not be underrated. In particular, the contribution of Italian painters from Duccio and Simone Martini onwards is central to the evolution of the so-called International Gothic style developing in Burgundy, Bohemia and north Italy in the late 14th and early 15th centuries.\nGouache is opaque watercolour, known also as poster paint and designer's colour. It is thinned with water for applying, with sable- and hog-hair brushes, to white or tinted paper and card and, occasionally, to silk. Honey, starch, or acrylic is sometimes added to retard its quick-drying property. Liquid glue is preferred as a thinner by painters wishing to retain the tonality of colours (which otherwise dry slightly lighter in key) and to prevent thick paint from flaking. Gouache paints have the advantages that they dry out almost immediately to a mat finish and, if required, without visible brush marks. These qualities, with the capacities to be washed thinly or applied in thick impasto and a wide colour range that now includes fluorescent and metallic pigments, make the medium particularly suited to preparatory studies for oil and acrylic paintings. It is the medium that produces the suede finish and crisp lines characteristic of many Indian and Islamic miniatures, and it has been used in Western screen and fan decoration and by modern artists such as Rouault, Klee, Dubuffet, and Morris Graves.\nTerm applied to the lofty and rhetorical manner of history painting that in academic theory was considered appropriate to the most serious and elevated subjects. The classic exposition of its doctrines is found in Reynolds's Third and Fourth Discourses (1770 and 1771), where he asserts that 'the gusto grande of the Italians, the beau id\u00e9al of the French, and the great style, genius, and taste among the English, are but different appellations of the same thing'. The idea of the Grand Manner took shape in 17th-century Italy, notably in the writings of Bellori. His friend Poussin and the great Bolognese painters of the 17th century were regarded as outstanding exponents of the Grand Manner, but the greatest of all was held to be Raphael.\nAn extensive journey to the Continent, chiefly to France, the Netherlands, and above all Italy, sometimes in the company of a tutor, that became a conventional feature in the education of the English gentleman in the 18th century. Such tours often took a year or more. It had a noticeable effect in bringing a more cosmopolitan spirit to the taste of connoisseurs and laid the basis for many collections among the landed gentry. It also helped the spread of the fashion for Neoclassicism and an enthusiasm for Italian painting. Among the native artists who catered for this demand were Batoni, Canaletto, Pannini, and Piranesi, and British artists (such as Nollekens) were sometimes able to support themselves while in Italy by working for the dealers and restorers who supplied the tourist clientele. There was also a flourishing market in guide books.\nA cross with four arms of equal length.\nTerm current with several different meanings in the literature of the visual arts. In the context of the fine arts, it most usually refers to those arts that rely essentially on line or tone rather than colour \u2014 i.e. drawing and the various forms of engraving. Some writers, however, exclude drawing from this definition, so that the term 'graphic art' is used to cover the various processes by which prints are created. In another sense, the term \u2014 sometimes shortened to 'graphics' \u2014 is used to cover the entire field of commercial printing, including text as well as illustrations.\nA painting done entirely in one colour, usually gray. Grisaille paintings were often intended to imitate sculpture.\nItalian political terms derived from the German Welf, a personal and thence family name of the dukes of Bavaria, and Waiblingen, the name of a castle of the Hohenstaufen dukes of Swabia apparently used as a battle cry. Presumably introduced into Italy 1198-1218, when partisans of the Emperor Otto IV (Welf) contested central Italy with supporters of Philip of Swabia and his' nephew Frederick II, the terms do not appear in the chronicles until the Emperor Frederick's conflict with the Papacy 1235-50, when Guelf meant a supporter of the Pope and Ghibelline a supporter of the Empire. From 1266 to 1268, when Naples was conquered by Charles of Anjou, brother of Louis IX, the French connection became the touchstone of Guelfism, and the chain of Guelf alliances stretching from Naples, through central Italy, to Provence and Paris, underwritten by the financial interests of the Tuscan bankers, became an abiding feature of European politics. The Italian expeditions of Henry of Luxemburg (1310-13) and Lewis of Bavaria (1327-29) spread the terms to northern Italy, with the Visconti of Milan and the della Scala of Verona emerging as the leading Ghibelline powers. Attempts by Guelf propagandists to claim their party as the upholder of liberty and their opponents as the protagonists of tyranny rarely coincide with the truth: power politics, then as now, generally overrode ideology in inter-state affairs.\nFactional struggles had existed within the Italian states from time immemorial, the parties taking a multitude of local names. In Florence, however, Guelf and Ghibelline were applied to the local factions which supposedly originated in a feud between the Buondelmonte and Amidei clans, c. 1216. In 1266-67 the Guelf party, which had recruited most of the merchant class, finally prevailed over the predominantly noble Ghibellines; after this, internal factions in Florence went under other names, like the Blacks and the Whites who contested for control of the commune between 1295 and 1302. Meanwhile the Parte Guelfa had become a corporate body whose wealth and moral authority as the guardian of political orthodoxy enabled it to play the part of a powerful pressure group through most of the 14th century. After the War of the Eight Saints, the influence of the Parte declined rapidly. Although its palace was rebuilt c. 1418-58 to the designs of Brunelleschi, it had no part in the conflicts surrounding the rise of the Medici r\u00e9gime.\nAn association of the masters of a particular craft, trade or profession (painters, goldsmiths, surgeons, and so on) set up to protect its members' rights and interests. Such guilds existed in virtually every European city in the 16th century. The guild also monitored standards of work, acted as a court for those who brought their trade into disrepute, and provided assistance to members in need.\nGuilds were essentially associations of masters in particular crafts, trades, or professions. In Italy they go back a long way; there is documentary evidence of guilds in 6th century Naples. In origin they were clubs which observed religious festivals together and attended the funerals of their members, but in time they acquired other functions. Their economic function was to control standards and to enforce the guild's monopoly of particular activities in a particular territory. Their political function was to participate in the government of the city-state. In some cities, notably Florence in the 14th century, only guildsmen were eligible for civic office, thus excluding both noblemen (unless they swallowed their pride and joined, as some did), and unskilled workers like the woolcombers and dyers. In Florence in 1378 these groups demanded the right to form their own guilds, and there were similar movements of protest in Siena and Bologna.\nGuilds were also patrons of art, commissioning paintings for guildhalls, contributing to the fabric fund of cathedrals and collaborating on collective projects like the statues for Orsanmichele at Florence. The guilds were not equal. In Florence, the 7 'Greater Guilds', including such prestigious occupations as judges and bankers, outranked the 14 'Lesser Guilds', and in general the guild hierarchy was reflected in the order of precedence in processions. The great age of the guilds was the 13th and 14th centuries. The economic recession after 1348 meant fewer opportunities for journeymen to become masters, and greater hostility between master and man. The shift from trade to land in the 15th and 16th centuries meant a decline in the social standing of the crafts. In some towns, such as Brescia and Vicenza, guild membership actually became a disqualification instead of a qualification for municipal office. The guilds lost their independence and became instruments of state control. In 16th century Venice, for example, they were made responsible for supplying oarsmen for the galleys of the state.\nDutch painters who worked in The Hague between 1860 and 1900, producing renderings of local landscapes and the daily activities of local fisherman and farmers in the style of Realism. In this they extended the traditional focus on genre of the 17th-century Dutch masters with the fresh observation of their contemporary French counterparts, the Barbizon school. The group included Jozef Isra\u00ebls; Hendrik Willem Mesdag; Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch; Jacob Maris, Matthijs Maris, and Willem Maris; Johannes Bosboom; and Anton Mauve.\nIn a drawing, print or painting, a series of close parallel lines that create the effect of shadow, and therefore contour and three-dimensionality In crosshatching the lines overlap.\nthe study of the meaning of emblems and coats of arms, with the rules governing their use.\nThe heretical movements affecting Italy between the mid-12th and the mid-14th century had their main impact in an area covering the north-west of the peninsula and southern France: it is not possible to speak of distinct Italian and meridional French movements. The authentically Christian movements which were expelled from the Catholic Church must in the first instance be distinguished from Catharism, which represented an infiltration by the originally non-Christian dualist system of Manichaeanism; from the start, the Cathars were an anti-church. By contrast, the Waldensian, Spiritual and Joachimite movements appeared initially as vital manifestations of Catholicism; only after their condemnation by the ecclesiastical authorities do they seem to have developed notably eccentric doctrines and to have described themselves as the true Church in opposition to the institutional Church; they had a recognizable kinship with movements that remained within the pale of orthodoxy.\nThese Christian heresies had in common an attachment to the ideal of apostolic poverty, which came to be seen by the ecclesiastical authorities as a challenge to the institutionalized Church. The Waldensians or Valdesi (not to be confused with Valdesiani, the followers of Juan de Valdes, d. 1541) took their origin from the Poor Men of Lyons, founded by Peter Valdes or Waldo in the 1170s. They were distinguished by a strong attachment to the Bible and a desire to imitate Christ's poverty. At first approved by the Papacy as an order of laymen, they were condemned in 1184. Likewise condemned was the rather similar Lombard movement of the Humiliati. One stream of these remained as an approved order within the Catholic Church, while others merged with the Waldensians. The Waldensians came to teach that the sacraments could be administered validly only by the pure, i.e: only by Waldensian superiors or perfecti practising evangelical poverty. Alone among the heretical sects existing in Italy they were organized as a church, and regarded themselves as forming, together with brethren north of the Alps, one great missionary community. They spread all over western and central Europe but in the long term they came to be largely confined to the Rhaetian and Cottian Alps (the Grisons and Savoy). The Italian Waldensians in the 16th century resisted absorption by Reformed Protestantism.\nThe early Franciscans might be regarded as a movement, similar in character to the Poor Men of Lyons, which was won for the cause of Catholic orthodoxy. However, divisions within the order over the issue of poverty led to religious dissidence. The Spirituals held up the ideal of strict poverty as obligatory for Franciscans and, indeed, normative for churchmen; following the Papacy's recognition of the Franciscan order as a property-owning body in 1322-23, their position became one of criticism of the institutional Church as such. Their heresies came to incorporate the millenarian doctrines of the 12th century abbot Joachim of Fiore. He had prophesied a coming age of the Holy Spirit ushered in by Spiritual monks; his heretical followers prophesied a new Spiritual gospel that would supersede the Bible. Joachimite Spiritualists came to see the pope, head of the 'carnal Church', as Antichrist. The main impact of the movement upon the laity was in southern France; in Italy it was an affair of various groups of fraticelli de paupere vita (little friars of the poor life), mainly in the south.\nA courtesan of ancient Greece. There may have been one or two hetaira called Lais in ancient Corinth. One was the model of the celebrated painter Apelles.\nprepared throne, Preparation of the Throne, ready throne or Throne of the Second Coming is the Christian version of the symbolic subject of the empty throne found in the art of the ancient world. In the Middle Byzantine period, from about 1000, it came to represent more specifically the throne prepared for the Second Coming of Christ, a meaning it has retained in Eastern Orthodox art to the present.\nPainting concerned with the representation of scenes from the Bible, history (usually classical history), and classical literature.

The 19th-century romantic movements of England, Germany, and France were introduced to the United States by such writers as Washington Irving and James Fenimore Cooper. At the same time, American painters were studying in Rome, absorbing much of the romantic aesthetic of the European painters. Adapting the European ideas about nature to a growing pride in the beauty of their homeland, for the first time a number of American artists began to devote themselves to landscape painting instead of portraiture. First of the group of artists properly classified with the Hudson River school was Thomas Doughty; his tranquil works greatly influenced later artists of the school. Thomas Cole, whose dramatic and colourful landscapes are among the most impressive of the school, may be said to have been its leader during the group's most active years. Among the other important painters of the school are Asher B. Durand, J. F. Kensett, S. F. B. Morse, Henry Inman, Jasper Cropsey, Frederick E.

Or maybe not \u2014 only 5% of women deliver on their estimated due dates, and many first-time mothers find themselves waiting up to 2 weeks after their due date for their baby to arrive.\nA baby born at 40 weeks weighs, on average, about 7 pounds, 4 ounces (3,300 grams) and measures about 20 inches (51 cm). Don't expect your baby to look like the Gerber baby right off the bat \u2014 newborns often have heads temporarily misshapen from the birth canal and may be covered with vernix and blood. Your baby's skin may have skin discolorations, dry patches, and rashes \u2014 these many variations are completely normal.\nBecause of the presence of your hormones in your baby's system, your baby's genitals (scrotum in boys and labia in girls) may appear enlarged. Your baby, whether a boy or a girl, may even secrete milk from the tiny nipples. This should disappear in a few days and is completely normal.\nRight after birth, your health care provider will suction mucus out of your baby's mouth and nose, and you'll hear that long-awaited first cry. Your baby may then be placed on your stomach, and the umbilical cord will be cut \u2014 often by the baby's dad, if he chooses to do the honors! A series of quick screening tests, such as the Apgar score, will be performed to assess your baby's responsiveness and vital signs, and he or she will be weighed and measured. If your pregnancy was high risk, or if a cesarean section was necessary, a neonatologist (a doctor who specializes in newborn intensive care) will be present at your delivery to take care of your baby right away. If your baby needs any special care to adjust to life outside the womb, it will be given \u2014 and then your newborn will be placed in your waiting arms.\nThis week you'll experience the moment you've been anticipating \u2014 your introduction to your baby! Before you can meet your baby, though, you have to go through labor and delivery. You may have learned about the three stages of birth in your prenatal classes. The first stage of labor works to thin and stretch your cervix by contracting your uterus at regular intervals. The second stage of labor is when you push your baby into the vaginal canal and out of your body. The third and final stage of labor is when you deliver the placenta.\nIf you don't go into labor within a week of your due date, your health care provider may recommend you receive a nonstress test, which monitors fetal heart rate and movement to be sure that the baby is receiving adequate oxygen and that the nervous system is responding. Talk to your health care provider to find out more about this test.\nSometimes mother nature may need a little coaxing. If your labor isn't progressing, or if your health or your baby's health requires it, your health care provider may induce labor by artificially rupturing the membranes or by administering the hormone oxytocin or other medications. If your pregnancy is high risk, or if there are any other potential complications, you may require a cesarean section delivery.\nSome women know ahead of time that they will be delivering via cesarean section and are able to schedule their baby's \"birth day\" well in advance. If you're one of them, you've probably been able to prepare yourself emotionally and mentally for the birth \u2014 which can help to lessen the feelings of disappointment that many mothers who are unable to deliver vaginally experience. But even if you have to undergo a cesarean section that wasn't planned, rest assured that you'll still be able to bond with your baby. It might not be the birth experience you imagined, but your beautiful newborn has arrived nonetheless.

{"text":"is a C based interpreter (runloop) that executes, what different compiler (like Mildew ) produce.\nIf you want to help SMOP, you can just take on one of the lowlevel S1P implementations and write it. If you have any questions ask ruoso or pmurias at #perl6 @ irc.freenode.org.\nThe Slides for the talk Perl 6 is just a SMOP are available, it introduces a bit of the reasoning behind SMOP. A newer version of the talk presented at YAPC::EU 2008 is available\nSMOP is an alternative implementation of a C engine to run Perl 6. It is focused in getting the most pragmatic approach possible, but still focusing in being able to support all Perl 6 features. Its core resembles Perl 5 in some ways, and it differs from Parrot in many ways, including the fact that SMOP is not a Virtual Machine. SMOP is simply a runtime engine that happens to have a interpreter run loop.\nThe main difference between SMOP and Parrot (besides the not-being-a-vm thing), is that SMOP is from bottom-up an implementation of the Perl 6 OO features, in a way that SMOP should be able to do a full bootstrap of the Perl 6 type system. Parrot on the other hand have a much more static low-level implementation (the PMC)\nThe same way PGE is a project on top of Parrot, SMOP will need a grammar engine for itself.\nSMOP is the implementation that is stressing the meta object protocol more than any other implementation, and so far that has been a very fruitful exercise, with Larry making many clarifications on the object system thanks to SMOP.\nImportant topics on SMOP\n- SMOP doesn't recurse in the C stack, and it doesn't actually define a mandatory paradigm (stack-based or register-based). SMOP has a Polymorphic Eval, that allows you to switch from one interpreter loop to another using Continuation Passing Style. See SMOP Stackless.\n- SMOP doesn't define a object system in its own. The only thing it defines is the concept of SMOP Responder Interface, which then encapsulates whatever object system. This feature is fundamental to implement the SMOP Native Types.\n- SMOP is intended to bootstrap itself from the low-level to the high-level. This is achieved by the fact that everything in SMOP is an Object. This way, even the low-level objects can be exposed to the high level runtime. See SMOP OO Bootstrap.\n- SMOP won't implement a parser in its own, it will use STD or whatever parser gets ported to its runtime first.\n- In order to enable the bootstrap, the runtime have a set of SMOP Constant Identifiers that are available for the sub-language compilers to use.\n- There are some special SMOP Values Not Subject to Garbage Collection.\n- A new interpreter implementation SMOP Mold replaced SLIME\n- The \"official\" smop Perl 6 compiler is mildew - it lives in v6\/mildew\n- Currently there exists an old Elf backend which targets SMOP - it lives in misc\/elfish\/elfX\nSMOP GSoC 2009\nSee the Old SMOP Changelog","id":"<urn:uuid:9ef4d308-fa15-4196-86db-2db8b4c54358>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.perlfoundation.org\/perl6\/index.cgi?smop","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9141045213,"token_count":694,"score":2.875,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Re-inventing the Planned City Monday, March 12, 2012\nTAU and MIT launch pilot project to re-think 50's era \"New Towns\"\nA bird's-eye view of Kiryat Gat\nIn response to population growth, many \"new towns\" or planned cities were built around the world in the 1950s. But according to Dr. Tali Hatuka, head of Tel Aviv University's Laboratory for Contemporary Urban Design (LCUD) at the Department of Geography and the Human Environment, these cities are a poor fit for modern lifestyles \u2014 and it's time to innovate.\nTAU has launched a pilot project, in collaboration with a team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology led by Prof. Eran Ben-Joseph, to revitalize this aging model. Last month, a team of five TAU and 11 MIT graduate students visited Kiryat Gat, a mid-sized town in the south of Israel. Home to branches of industrial giants Hewlett-Packard Company and Intel, Kiryat Gat was chosen as a \"laboratory\" for re-designing outmoded planned civic spaces.\nBased on smart technologies, improved transportation, use of the city's natural surroundings, and a reconsideration of the current use of city space, the team's action plan is designed to help Kiryat Gat emerge as a new, technologically-advanced planned city \u2014 a prototype that could be applied to similar urban communities.\nPlanning a future for the mid-sized city\nThe project, jointly funded by TAU's Vice President for Research and MIT's MISTI Global Seed Funds, will create a new planning model that could reshape the future of Kiryat Gat and similar cities across the world which are often overlooked in academia and practical planning. \"Our goal is to put a spotlight on these kinds of towns and suggest innovative ways of dealing with their problems,\" says TAU student Roni Bar.\nMIT's Alice Shay, who visited Israel for the first time for the project, believes that Kiryat Gat, a city that massive urbanization has left behind, is an ideal place for the team to make a change. \"The city is at a catalyst point \u2014 an exciting moment where good governance and energy will give it the capacity to implement some of these new projects.\"\nTo tackle the design and planning challenges of the city, the team of students focused on four themes: the \"mobile city,\" which looked at transport and accessibility; the \"mediated city,\" dealing with technological infrastructure; the \"compact city,\" which reconsidered the use of urban space and population growth; and the \"natural city,\" which integrated environmental features into the urban landscape.\nFinding common ground\nUltimately, the team\u2019s goal is to create a more flexible city model that encourages residents and workers to be a more active part of the urban fabric of the city, said Dr. Hatuka. The current arrangement of dedicated industrial, residential, and core zones is out of step with a 21st century lifestyle, in which people work, live, and spend their leisure time in the same environment.\n\"Much of the past discourse about the design of sustainable communities and 'eco-cities' has been premised on using previously undeveloped land,\" says Prof. Ben-Joseph. \"In contrast, this project focuses on the 'retrofitting' of an existing environment \u2014 a more likely approach, given the extent of the world's already-built infrastructure.\"\nThe students from TAU and MIT have become a truly cohesive team, and their diversity of background helps challenge cultural preconceptions, Bar says. \"They ask many questions that help us to rethink things we took for granted.\" Shay agrees. \"Tali and Eran have created an incredible collaboration, encouraging us all to exchange ideas. Our contexts are different but there is a common urban design language.\"\nThe team estimates that they will be able to present the updated model of the city early next year. The next step is further exploring the project's key themes at a March meeting at MIT. And while the project has provided an exceptional educational experience for all involved, ideas are already leaping off the page and into the city's urban fabric. \"In the next two months, the Mayor of Kiryat Gat would like to push this model forward and implement the initial steps that we have offered,\" says an enthusiastic Dr. Hatuka.","id":"<urn:uuid:08c12af3-3a0e-45eb-852d-5a9c514658cb>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.aftau.org\/site\/News2\/596546752?page=NewsArticle&id=16181&news_iv_ctrl=-1","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9586700797,"token_count":895,"score":2.609375,"int_score":3}
{"text":"- Exam wrappers. As David Thompson describes the process, \"exam wrappers required students to reflect on their performance before and after seeing their graded tests.\" The first four questions, completed just prior to receiving their graded test, asked students to report the time they spent preparing for the test, their methods of preparation, and their predicted test grade. After reviewing their graded test, students completed the final three reflection questions, including a categorization of test mistakes and a list of changes to implement in preparation for the next test. Thompson then collected and made copies of the wrappers returned them to the students several days later, reminding them to consider what they planned to do differently or the same in preparation for the upcoming test. Thompson reports that each reflection exercise required only 8-10 minutes of class time. Clara Hardy and others also describes uses exam wrappers.\n- Reading Reflections. As Karl Wirth writes, reading reflections, effectively outlined by David Bressoud (2008), are designed to address some of the challenges students face with college-level reading assignments. Students submit online reading reflections (e.g., using Moodle or Blackboard) after completing each reading assignment and before coming to class. In each reflection, students summarize the important concepts of the reading and describe what was interesting, surprising, or confusing to them. The reading reflections not only encourage students to read regularly before class, but they also promote content mastery and foster student development of monitoring, self-evaluation, and reflection skills. For the instructor, reading reflections facilitate \"just-in-time\" teaching and provide invaluable insights into student thinking and learning. According to Wirth, expert readers are skilled at using a wide range of strategies during all phases of reading (e.g., setting goals for learning, monitoring comprehension during reading, checking comprehension, and self-reflection), but most college instruction simply assumes the mastery of such metacognitive skills.\n- Knowledge surveys. Many members of the group were influenced by Karl Wirth's work on \"knowledge surveys\" as a central strategy for helping students think about their thinking. Knowledge surveys involve simple self-reports from students about their knowledge of course concepts and content. In knowledge surveys, students are presented with different facets of course content and are asked to indicate whether they know the answer, know some of the answer, or don't know the answer. Faculty can use these reports to gauge how confident students feel in their understanding of course material at the beginning or end of a course, before exams or papers, or even as graduating seniors or alumni.\nKristin Bonnie's report relates how her students completed a short knowledge survey (6-12 questions) online (via Google forms) on the material covered in class that week. Rather than providing the answer to each question, students indicated their confidence in their ability to answer the question correctly (I know; I think I know; I don't know). Students received a small amount of credit for completing the knowledge survey. She used the information to review material that students seemed to struggle with. In addition, a subset of these questions appeared on their exam \u2013 the knowledge survey therefore served as a review sheet.Wirth notes that the surveys need not take much class time and can be administered via paper or the web. The surveys can be significant for clarifying course objectives, structure, and design. For students, knowledge surveys achieve several purposes: they help make clear course objectives and expectations, are useful as study guides, can serve as a formative assessment tool, and, perhaps most critically, aid in their development of self-assessment and metacognitive skills. For instructors, the surveys help them assess learning gains, instructional practices, and course design.","id":"<urn:uuid:9d6abf05-e21c-4917-ab95-cb9f3fd306aa>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/serc.carleton.edu\/acm_teagle\/interventions","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9568482041,"token_count":746,"score":3.578125,"int_score":4}
{"text":"This \u201cThe Best\u2026\u201d list is a companion to The Best Sites To Learn About The U.S. Financial Crisis. Those sites tried to explain how we got into this mess. The resources on this list share what is happening to us as a result. These sites try to give a picture of the recession\u2019s effects throughout the world.\nThese sites, all relatively accessible to English Language Learners, are divided into three sections. The first are some narrative reports on what is occurring. The second are interactive charts or graphs that show \u201cthe numbers.\u201d The third are multimedia presentations giving a human face to the recession (of course, most of my students are experiencing that human face directly in their own lives).\nHere are my picks for The Best Sites To Learn About The Recession:\nVoice of America\u2019s Special English has a report (with audio support for the text) titled Trying To Live With A Recession In The World\u2019s Largest Economy.\nBreaking New English has a lesson (again, with audio support for the text) called Huge U.S. Job Losses Spark Recession Fears.\nESL Podcast Blog has an engaging report on ways a recession affects society\nCBBC has a good report on the recession in the United Kingdom.\nCHARTS & GRAPHS:\nWhere Does Your State Rank? is a map from CNN showing the recession\u2019s effect across the United States.\nLayoffs Pile-Up is a graph from the Wall Street Journal showing what economic sectors are experiencing the worst job loss.\nUSA Today has a very complete analysis on jobs loss and growth in the United States.\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures also has an interactive map on the effects of the recession in all fifty states.\nThese would require some teacher explanation, but are intriguing nevertheless. They\u2019re are two infographics showing how the proposed economic stimulus would be used \u2014 one from the Washington Post and the other from Credit Loan. CNN has a new interactive on the compromise that the Senate and House just agreed to.\nThe Obamameter is a regularly updated visual representation of different aspects of the U.S. economy. It would be accessible to Intermediate English Language Learners with some explanation.\nFinViz shows the stock market in a vivid color-code.\nThe Economy Tracker from CNN shows the latest economic data on a map, and combines that with personal stories of those affected.\nThe Geography Of A Recession comes from The New York Times and shows, in detail, unemployment rates throughout the United States.\nMaplibs has a color-coded world map that shows international financial centers. The key is the color \u2014 if it\u2019s shown in red then it\u2019s down, if it\u2019s shown in green then it\u2019s up.\nThe Sacramento Bee has a scary map of unemployment in California.\nEconomic Reality Check is from CNN and provide short facts about different aspects of the recession.\nThe Sacramento Bee has just published an Income Gap Interactive Graphic. It\u2019s based on Sacramento data, but I suspect the information is similar across the United States. It vividly, and in a way that\u2019s accessible to English Language Learners, shows how long it takes for different people (by occupation, ethnicity, and educational background) to earn $100,000.\nMSNBC has developed what they call an Adversity Index. It\u2019s an animated map that \u201cmeasures the economic health of 381 metro areas and all 50 states.\u201d It\u2019s pretty intriguing, though would probably require some initial explanation before English Language Learners could fully decipher it. Right below the Adversity Map, you can also find a \u201cMap:Recession-resistant areas\u201d that highlights communities in the U.S. that have escaped the recession\u2019s effects.\nThe San Francisco Chronicle published a simple and very accessible chart today titled Unemployment Characteristics.

It supposedly lists all the projects different governmental projects have proposed to do with stimulus money, and then people can vote which ones they think are best. They\u2019re categorized by community, so they\u2019re very accessible. The only drawback to it is since it\u2019s a wiki, even though all the projects are listed, many don\u2019t have detailed information yet on what the project entails. Nevertheless, its interactivity could offer some good possibilities for student engagement.\nHow Do You Feel About The Economy? is a great interactive graphic \u2014 especially for English Language Learners \u2014 from The New York Times. You\u2019re supposed to be able to enter a word that indicates how you\u2019re filling, and you\u2019re given many choices.

{"text":"On May 15, the House Agriculture Committee passed its 2013 farm bill. The bill would cut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the Food Stamp Program) by almost $21 billion over the next decade, eliminating food assistance to nearly 2 million low-income people, mostly working families with children and senior citizens.\nThe bill\u2019s SNAP cuts would come on top of an across-the-board reduction in benefits that every SNAP recipient will experience starting November 1, 2013.\nThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program\u2019s (SNAP) primary purpose is to increase the food purchasing power of eligible low-income households in order to improve their nutrition and alleviate hunger and malnutrition. The program\u2019s success in meeting this core goal has been well documented. Less well understood is the fact that the program has become quite effective in supporting work and that its performance in this area has improved substantially in recent years.\nThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the Food Stamp Program) is the nation\u2019s most important anti-hunger program. In 2012, it helped almost 47 million low-income Americans to afford a nutritionally adequate diet in a typical month.\nNearly 72 percent of SNAP participants are in families with children; more than one-quarter of participants are in households with seniors or people with disabilities.\nSNAP is the nation\u2019s most important anti-hunger program.\nThis chartbook highlights some of the key characteristics of the almost 47 million people using the program as well as trends and data on program administration and use.\nRelated: SNAP is Effective and Efficient\nSNAP, the nation\u2019s most important anti-hunger program, helps roughly 35 million low-income Americans to afford a nutritionally adequate diet. WIC \u2014 short for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children \u2014 provides nutritious foods, information on healthy eating, and health care referrals to about 8 million low-income pregnant and postpartum women, infants, and children under five. The School Lunch and School Breakfast programs provide free and reduced-price meals that meet federal nutritional standards to over 22 million school children from low-income families.\n- Introduction to SNAP\nThe Center designs and promotes polices to make the Food Stamp Program more adequate to help recipients afford an adequate diet, more accessible to eligible families and individuals, and easier for states to administer. We also help states design their own food stamp programs for persons ineligible for the federal program. Our work on the WIC program includes ensuring that sufficient federal funds are provided to serve all eligible applicants and on helping states contain WIC costs. Our work on child nutrition programs focuses on helping states and school districts implement recent changes in how they determine a child's eligibility for free or reduced-priced school meals.\nMay 17, 2013\nRevised May 16, 2013\nUpdated May 8, 2013\nRevised May 1, 2013\nUpdated May 1, 2013\n- View All By Date","id":"<urn:uuid:bc53165f-1d0a-4c12-aaa0-5d50b436cadf>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.cbpp.org\/research\/?fa=topic&id=31","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9420174956,"token_count":609,"score":3.3125,"int_score":3}

{"text":"By Jason Kohn, Contributing Columnist\nLike many of us, scientific researchers tend to be creatures of habit. This includes research teams working for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. government agency charged with measuring the behavior of oceans, atmosphere, and weather.\nMany of these climate scientists work with massive amounts of data \u2013 for example, the National Weather Service collecting up-to-the-minute temperature, humidity, and barometric readings from thousands of sites across the United States to help forecast weather. Research teams then rely on some the largest, most powerful high-performance computing (HPC) systems in the world to run models, forecasts, and other research computations.\nGiven the reliance on HPC resources, NOAA climate researchers have traditionally worked onsite at major supercomputing facilities, such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, where access to supercomputers are just steps away. As researchers crate ever more sophisticated models of ocean and atmospheric behavior, however, the HPC requirements have become truly staggering.\nNow, NOAA is using a super-high-speed network called \u201cn-wave\u201d to connect research sites across the United States with the computing resources they need. The network has been operating for several years, and today transports enough data to fill a 10-Gbps network to full capacity, all day, every day. NOAA is now upgrading this network to allow even more data traffic, with the goal of ultimately supporting 100-Gbps data rates.\n\u201cOur scientists were really used to having a computer in their basement,\u201d says Jerry Janssen, manager, n-wave Network, NOAA, in a video about the project. \u201cWhen that computer moved a couple thousand miles away, we had to give them a lot of assurances that, one, the data would actually move at the speed they needed it to move, but also that they could rely on it to be there. The amount of data that will be generated under this model will exceed 80-100 Terabits per day.\u201d\nThe n-wave project means much more than just a massive new data pipe. It represents a fundamental shift in the way that scientists can conduct their research, allowing them to perform hugely demanding supercomputer runs of their data from dozens of remote locations. As a result, it gives NOAA climate scientists much more flexibility in where and how they work.\n\u201cFor the first time, NOAA scientists and engineers in completely separate parts of the country, all the way to places like Alaska and Hawaii and Puerto Rico, will have the bandwidth they need, without restriction,\u201d says Janssen. \u201cNOAA will now be able to do things it never thought it could do before.\u201d\nIn addition to providing fast, stable access to HPC resources, n-wave is also allowing NOAA climate scientists to share resources much more easily with scientists in the U.S. Department of Energy and other government agencies. Ideally, this level of collaboration and access to supercomputing resources will help climate scientists continue to develop more effective climate models, improve weather forecasts, and allow us to better understand our climate.\nPowering Vital Climate Research\nThe high-speed nationwide HPC connectivity capability provided by n-wave is now enabling a broad range of NOAA basic science and research activities. Examples include:\n- Basic data dissemination, allowing research teams to collect up-to-the-minute data on ocean, atmosphere, and weather from across the country, and make that data available to other research teams and agencies nationwide.\n- Ensemble forecasting, where researchers run multiple HPC simulations using different initial conditions and modeling techniques, in order to refine their atmospheric forecasts and minimize errors.\n- Severe weather modeling, where scientists draw on HPC simulations, real-time atmospheric data, and archived storm data to better understand and predict the behavior of storms.\n- Advancing understanding of the environment to be able to better predict short-term and long-term environmental changes, mitigate threats, and provide the most accurate data to inform policy decisions.\nAll of this work is important, and will help advance our understanding of Earth\u2019s climate. And it is all a testament to the amazing networking technologies and infrastructure that scientists now have at their disposal, which puts the most powerful supercomputing resources in the world at their fingertips \u2013 even when they are thousands of miles away.","id":"<urn:uuid:c23e3842-a002-4f6b-9554-bafecec0beed>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/blogs.cisco.com\/cle\/noaa-how-networks-are-used-in-climate-research\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9429180026,"token_count":899,"score":3.3125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Mississippians know the strength of longleaf pines. These native trees braved Hurricane Katrina 48 percent better than their loblolly cousins. Even so, the ancient longleaf pine forests of the South are a threatened ecosystem.\nThese forests once dominated the region, spanning 90 million acres. Now, they cover just 3 million acres. As longleaf habitat disappears, so do many important and endangered species, like the gopher tortoise, which rely on it. The gopher tortoise is considered a keystone species in longleaf pine habitat, with more than 300 different vertebrate and invertebrate species relying on burrows dug by the reptiles for their homes.\nLongleaf pine forests are home to at least 122 endangered or threatened plant and animal species. In addition, they can contain as many as 300 different species of groundcover plants per acre, and about 60 percent of the amphibian and reptile species found in the Southeast.\nUSDA\u2019s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) wants to restore longleaf forests to their former glory with the help of landowners like Orby Wright of Purvis, Miss. The Healthy Forests Reserve Program (HFRP) offered by NRCS allows Wright to manage his tall stands of longleaf pines and the blanket of legumes and forbs across the understory of his Quail Hollow Ranch. HFRP is one of several programs in the tool chest of the Longleaf Pine Initiative, a nine-state effort to bolster longleaf pine forests.\nForbs are clovers, sunflowers, milkweed and other common wildflowers typical of the Mississippi forest floor. Both forbs and legumes provide sustenance and cover for a wide range of wildlife.\nWright purchased about 2,000 acres four years ago from a pecan company. The land boasts longleaf pines of different ages\u2014some are decades old, while others are just saplings. With the help of NRCS, Wright has planted new longleaf pines while taking care of his older, taller trees.\nA healthy longleaf pine ecosystem requires occasional fires. Many years ago, wildfires frequented the longleaf landscape, creating food for wildlife and providing other benefits.

{"text":"Combined Gas Law\nThe Combined Gas Law combines Charles Law, Boyle s Law and Gay Lussac s Law. The Combined Gas Law states that a gas pressure x volume x temperature = constant.\nAlright. In class you should have learned about the three different gas laws. the first one being Boyle's law and it talks about the relationship between pressure and volume of a particular gas. The next one should be Charles law which talks about the volume and temperature of a particular gas. And the last one should be Gay Lussac's law which talks about the relationship between pressure and temperature of a particular gas. Okay. But what happens when you have pressure, volume and temperature all changing? Well, we're actually going to combine these gas laws to form one giant gas law called the combined gas law. Okay.\nIf you notice then these three gas laws the pressure and volume are always in the numerator. So we're going to keep them on the numerator. p1v1. And notice the temperature is in the denominator over t1. So all these things are just squished into one and then p2v2 over t2. Okay. So this is what we're going to call the combined gas law. So let's actually get an example and do one together.\nAlright, so I have a problem up here that says a gas at 110 kilo pascals and 33 celsius fills a flexible container with an initial volume of two litres, okay? If the temperature is raised to 80 degrees celsius and the pressure is raised to 440 kilo pascals, what is the new volume? Okay. So notice we have three variables. We're talking about pressure, temperature and volume. Okay, so now we're going to employ this combined gas law dealing with all three of these variables. So we're going to look at our first, our first number 110 kilo pascals and that's going to, that is the unit of pressure. So we know that's p1. Our p1 is 110 kilo pascals, at 30 degree celsius. I don't like things with celsius so I'm going to change this to kelvin. So I'm going to add 273 to that which makes it 303 kelvin. That's our temperature. And my initial volume is two litres so I'm going to say v1=2 litres. Okay then I continue reading. If the temperature is raised at 80 degree celsius, again we want it in kelvin, so we're going to add 273 making it to 353. So our t2 is 353 kelvin and the pressure increased to 440 kilo pascals, the pressure p2 is equal to 440 kilo pascals which I'm very happy that I kept it in kilo pascals that I kept it in kilo pascals. I've got to make sure these units are the same because pressure can be measured in several different units. I'm going to make sure all units are the same. And what is the new volume? So our v2 is our variable, what we're trying to find. Okay.\nSo let's basically plug all these variable in into our combined gas law to figure out what the new volume would be. Okay. So I'm going to erase this and say our pressure one is 110 kilo pascals. Our volume one is two litres. Our temperature one is 303 kelvin. Our pressure two is 440 kilo pascals. We don't know our volume so we're just going to say v2 over 353 kelvin. Okay. When I'm looking for a variable I'm going to cross multiply these guys. So I'm going to say 353 times 110 times 2 and that should give me seven, 77660, if you put that in a calculator. So I just cross multiply these guys. And I cross multiply these guys 303 times 440 times v2 gives me 133320v2. Okay, so then I want to get my, I want to isolate my variable, so I'm going to divide 133320. 133320. And I find that my new volume is 0.58. 0.58 metres. And that is how you do the combined gas law.","id":"<urn:uuid:5f1963a4-8da7-4d73-9dda-3c8691608115>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/brightstorm.com\/science\/chemistry\/kinetic-molecular-theory\/combined-gas-law\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9422872066,"token_count":873,"score":4.09375,"int_score":4}

These replicas are a wonderful way to learn more about a culture.\nPottery in any culture is an age-old practice that was originally practical and eventually became seen as an art form. Ancient Native American pieces are beautifully decorated ceramics that are not only functional but a pleasure to look at as well. Choose a style of pottery from one Native nation to replicate.\nBased on the style of the pot, choose an armature such as a recycled container or crumpled aluminum foil. Cover this basic form with a thin Crayola\u00ae Model Magic\u00ae layer.\nAdd embellishments to your pot by creating ropes, leather cords, feathers, and beads, as appropriate to the culture and time period, and affixing them to your pot. For even edges, cut the compound with Crayola Scissors.\nOne way to make beads is to cut a long piece of fishing line. Make small Model Magic balls and wrap them around the fishing line about half-way down the length. Leave enough fishing line uncovered so you can use it to wrap around the lip of the pot later. Try making different shapes of beads and alternating colors to get different patterns. Another way to make beads is by wrapping the Model Magic compound around short pieces of plastic straws. You can then string your beads any way you like.\nAt the end of a string of beads on Native pottery, there are often large decorative feathers. Roll out Model Magic compound into feathers. Combine different colors for multicolor feathers. Then take a craft stick or other modeling tool to etch in the feather\u2019s vein and the edges. Press the feather on the fishing line at the end of your beads. Cut off any fishing line that sticks out on the bottom. Wrap the extra fishing line around the lip of the pot and tie a knot.\nYou can hide the fishing line by covering the lip with cords or other decorative elements. Adorn your pot with a beautiful rope by braiding three long pieces of Model Magic compound and then wrapping the braid around the lip.\nAdd leather-like cords by rolling out long pieces of Model Magic compound and pressing them a little flat.

{"text":"How much fun is it to be a child in your home? Do you ever stop to think about how the house looks from their point of view? My task for this week is to conduct a Child\u2019s Eye Audit of our living space, to try and make the rooms more child- and play-friendly. The audit need only take a few minutes and might suggest simple changes to make to improve the play space.\nTo conduct a child\u2019s eye audit, sit or kneel down so you\u2019re at your child\u2019s eye-level and consider the following things.\n1. Safety first. Most importantly, the room needs to be safe and it\u2019s useful t0 review this aspect of your home from time to time as children grow taller, become more mobile or more adventurous. Think about what your child can reach, what you don\u2019t want them to reach and make any necessary adjustments.\n2. Child\u2019s eye view. Sit back for a minute on the floor and scan the room. What\u2019s visible to your child at their height, and what\u2019s not? You might display all their lovely paintings on the wall and fridge door \u2013 but are they too high for your child to actually see? Is their view just of empty walls? Hang some art work at a lower level or set up a low shelf or table with a display of things they can enjoy.\n3. Within reach. Consider how accessible your toys are. Do you have an enabling environment where your child can independently help themselves to toys and resources to use in their play or is everything out of reach? Try to find a balance so you can keep the space tidy whilst still allowing free access. Open shelving and low baskets work well for us with some materials such as paint stored higher up.\n4. Ring the changes. Do you always have they same toys out? Sometimes putting away familiar toys and bringing out some forgotten ones can spark new creativity and fun. Don\u2019t have a complete change of resources though, as children do like to know where favourite toys are. With Christmas on the way now is a good time to have a toy audit, donating ones your child has grown out of to the charity shop and getting ideas for their Christmas list.\n5. Invitation to play. Do you have any toys that never get played with, or activities that you child rarely takes part in? What can you change to make things more inviting? If you\u2019d like to encourage some more reading, perhaps you could set up a cosy reading corner or story tent \u2013 with comfy cushions, a basket of tempting books and a favourite teddy to share with? If your toy kitchen has been ignored for a while, add some new resources to catch your child\u2019s eye: a muffin tin and paper cake cases, some jars of real dried pasta, a recipe book from your shelf or lay the table for a birthday tea and surprise your child with a new play possibility.\nDo you sometimes review things from your child\u2019s point of view? What changes have you made to make your space more child- and play- friendly? Leave a comment and share an idea with us.\nI\u2019m writing this at one o\u2019clock in the afternoon and the sky is grey and the rain is tumbling down. It\u2019s making me think about how the weather affects our play, and particularly I\u2019m thinking about how much time we spend outdoors in autumn and winter. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that playing outside is wonderful for children: the fresh air, the feeling of space, the sensory benefits of being in nature. I certainly know with my own two girls, and all the children I\u2019ve looked after, that if we\u2019re having a grumpy sort of day, getting outside \u2013 in the garden, park or just for a walk \u2013 most often is all that\u2019s needed to lighten everyone\u2019s mood.\nBut it\u2019s getting colder now, and windy and rainy and dark. If you\u2019re the type who is happy to be outside all the time in all weathers, I really do salute you. I however am naturally inclined to prefer a hot cup of coffee and a warm blanket inside! We do play outside everyday, whatever the weather, but there\u2019s no denying we play outdoors less in winter \u2013 which I\u2019m guessing is the same for lots of you? So, I\u2019m resolving to put more thought into getting out there and planning on bringing you some posts over the next few months that inspire us to venture out. I\u2019d also like to invite you to share your ideas too. The Play Academy carnival on Friday is open to any of your posts and I\u2019d also love to hear from you if you\u2019d like to write a guest post here. (On any play subject in fact, not just on playing outside. You can e-mail me cathy (at) nurturestore (dot) co (dot) uk if you have an idea you\u2019d like to write about).\nTo start us off, my top three tips for getting outside, whatever the weather are\u2026\n- Keep yourself warm. If you\u2019re wearing the right clothes, you\u2019re much more likely to enjoy your time outside. Pretty much all the children I know don\u2019t care if it\u2019s cold, windy or raining \u2013 they are active kids and just love being outside. So, to help everyone enjoy themselves outside, and to stop you cutting short the children\u2019s outdoor fun because you\u2019ve had enough, my first tip is to make sure you are wearing the right clothes. Layer up, don\u2019t forget your hat and gloves and make sure you are cosy.\n- Get active. We\u2019re going to shift our outdoor play away from fairy gardens and dinosaur world\u2019s and include lots more active games. Hopscotch, skipping, what\u2019s the time Mr. Wolf are great fun and will keep everyone on the move.\n- Audit your outdoor space. Now is a good time to review your garden and get it ready for the colder months. Think about what you play outside and re-locate things or make changes to suit the weather. We\u2019ll move the sandpit and den to under our covered area and make sure there are lots of props outside ready to spark active play (bikes, balls, kites, hula hoops). We\u2019re not likely to do as much water play outside, so I\u2019ll be thinking of ways to bring this inside.\nWhat about you \u2013 are you an all weather family? How do you promote lots of outdoor play, whatever the weather?\nBack in January I resolved to make 2010 our Year of Play. I\u2019ve been thinking about this again this month as L has started at school. In last week\u2019s Play Academy link-up I talked about wanting to make sure the girls still have lots of opportunity for playing, as well as schooling. So this weeks Twitter Tips are dedicated to having a playful return to school. The Twitter Tips get tweeted on a Friday at 8.30pm and in previous weeks they\u2019ve started great twitter conversations, with people swapping ideas. The main thing I love about blogging is it being a forum to get inspiration and encouragement from others, so please feel free to add your own ideas in the comments or on our Facebook page. Join in, swap ideas, go play!\nHow to have a playful Back to School\n#goplay Twitter Tip #1If you\u2019re using after school clubs check how playful they are: do they offer free play after a structured school day\n#goplay Twitter Tip #2Make the school run fun: cycle, scoot or play i-spy. Leave a little earlier to let the kids play a bit before class\n#goplay Twitter Tip #3 Set up a play invitation in the morning to entice the kids to play before they switch on the TV\n#goplay Twitter Tip #4 Rediscover some old school favourites such as conkers or fortune tellers\n#goplay Twitter Tip #5 Consider how many clubs to join so after school play time isn\u2019t lost in a busy schedule.\n#goplay Twitter Tip #6 Encourage playground fun by packing a skipping rope in the book bag. Ready for Ten has a great skipping tutuorial\n#goplay Twitter Tip #7 Plan family time for the weekend: it doesn\u2019t have to be expensive or extravagant but do make sure it happens.\n#goplay Twitter Tip #8 Consider screen time. Could your kids live without TV for an hour, a day, a week? What could they play instead?\n#goplay Twitter Tip #9 Locate the park nearest your school and stop off any day day you can on the way home. Enjoy some #playoutdoors\n#goplay Twitter Tip#10 Instead of only setting up a homework area set up a play area too. Add untoys & let them #goplay\nHow do you feel about the balance between school and play time? How do you manage homework at the weekend? Do your kids attend a playful school?\nHappily shared with Top Ten Tuesday.\nUse the linky below to add your post to the Play Academy\nOur summer holidays are drawing to a close and my Little is starting school on Monday (oh my!). I feel very strongly that our play should keep going. B is moving up to the Juniors and although her school offers are great curriculum including play, art, music, drama and experiments I think it\u2019s inevitable that her lessons will become more and more about schooling. September always feels like the start of the year to me, so I\u2019m keeping in mind my resolution to make 2010 our Year of Play, and we\u2019ll certainly be limiting our after school clubs and weekend commitments to allow plenty of time for playing. How do you feel about finding a balance between schooling (or home educating) and play?\nI\u2019m looking forward to getting even more inspiration from your Play Academy ideas this week \u2013 hope you\u2019ll add a link.\n1. Add your post to the Linky below. Remember to link to the individual post rather than your homepage. If you are not a blogger please visit the NurtureStore Facebook page and share your photo there.\n2. Go and visit some of the other blogs on the Linky. Leave a comment and say hi. Get ideas. Tell them you\u2019re visiting from the Play Academy.\n3. Add a link back from your own post to this Play Academy \u2013 your readers can then come and get ideas too.

Many programs developed by Linux Mint are actually written in Python, like the Software Manager and Update Manager for example. So I hope you do pick it up, but most important is you have a good time and enjoy using Linux Mint\nGoogle has a very basic Python class to get you started: https:\/\/developers.google.com\/edu\/python\/\n. The Hitchhiker's Guide To Python may be a nice resource along the way also: http:\/\/docs.python-guide.org\/en\/latest\/index.html\n. Another good resource is Learn Python The Hard Way, which throws you in the deep end but gets you going fast with the basics: http:\/\/learnpythonthehardway.org\/book\/\n. You don't need much to get started, Gedit or Kate both already have syntax highlighting for Python source code, though you may want to look into a lightweight programmer's editor like Geany to get a little more productive as your programming skills grow (you can install it from the Software Manager; I recommend you also install geany-plugins for some extra tools).

{"text":"By Irene Klotz\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (Reuters) - Despite searing daytime temperatures, Mercury, the planet closest to the sun, has ice and frozen organic materials inside permanently shadowed craters in its north pole, NASA scientists said on Thursday.\nEarth-based telescopes have been compiling evidence for ice on Mercury for 20 years, but the finding of organics was a surprise, say researchers with NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft, the first probe to orbit Mercury.\nBoth ice and organic materials, which are similar to tar or coal, were believed to have been delivered millions of years ago by comets and asteroids crashing into the planet.\n\"It's not something we expected to see, but then of course you realize it kind of makes sense because we see this in other places,\" such as icy bodies in the outer solar system and in the nuclei of comets, planetary scientist David Paige, with the University of California, Los Angeles, told Reuters.\nUnlike NASA's Mars rover Curiosity, which will be sampling rocks and soils to look for organic materials directly, the MESSENGER probe bounces laser beams, counts particles, measures gamma rays and collects other data remotely from orbit.\nThe discoveries of ice and organics, painstakingly pieced together for more than a year, are based on computer models, laboratory experiments and deduction, not direct analysis.\n\"The explanation that seems to fit all the data is that it's organic material,\" said lead MESSENGER scientist Sean Solomon, with Columbia University in New York.\nAdded Paige, \"It's not just a crazy hypothesis. No one has got anything else that seems to fit all the observations better.\"\nScientists believe the organic material, which is about twice as dark as most of Mercury's surface, was mixed in with comet- or asteroid-delivered ice eons ago.\nThe ice vaporized, then re-solidified where it was colder, leaving dark deposits on the surface. Radar imagery shows the dark patches subside at the coldest parts of the crater, where ice can exist on the surface.\nThe areas where the dark patches are seen are not cold enough for surface ice without the overlying layer of what is believed to be organics.\nSo remote was the idea of organics on Mercury that MESSENGER got a relatively easy pass by NASA's planetary protection protocols that were established to minimize the chance of contaminating any indigenous life-potential material with hitchhiking microbes from Earth.\nScientists don't believe Mercury is or was suitable for ancient life, but the discovery of organics on an inner planet of the solar system may shed light on how life got started on Earth and how life may evolve on planets beyond the solar system.\n\"Finding a place in the inner solar system where some of these same ingredients that may have led to life on Earth are preserved for us is really exciting,\" Paige said.\nMESSENGER, which stands for Mercury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry and Ranging, is due to complete its two-year mission at Mercury in March.\nScientists are seeking NASA funding to continue operations for at least part of a third year. The probe will remain in Mercury's orbit until the planet's gravity eventually causes it to crash onto the surface.\nWhether the discovery of organics now prompts NASA to select a crash zone rather than leave it up to chance remains to be seen. Microbes that may have hitched a ride on MESSENGER likely have been killed off by the harsh radiation environment at Mercury.\nThe research is published in this week's edition of the journal Science.\n(Editing by Kevin Gray and Vicki Allen)","id":"<urn:uuid:954bdf7e-7951-42c2-a6f6-6f7912bad693>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/krro.com\/news\/articles\/2012\/nov\/29\/nasa-probe-reveals-organics-ice-on-mercury\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9546101093,"token_count":753,"score":3.234375,"int_score":3}
{"text":"June 22, 2010 Millions of years before humans began battling it out over beachfront property, a similar phenomenon was unfolding in a diverse group of island lizards.\nOften mistaken for chameleons or geckos, Anolis lizards fight fiercely for resources, responding to rivals by doing push-ups and puffing out their throat pouches. But anoles also compete in ways that shape their bodies over evolutionary time, says a new study in the journal Evolution.\nAnolis lizards colonized the Caribbean from South America some 40 million years ago and quickly evolved a wide range of shapes and sizes. \"When anoles first arrived in the islands there were no other lizards quite like them, so there was abundant opportunity to diversify,\" said author Luke Mahler of Harvard University.\nFree from rivals in their new island homes, Anolis lizards evolved differences in leg length, body size, and other characteristics as they adapted to different habitats. Today, the islands of Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica and Puerto Rico -- collectively known as the Greater Antilles -- are home to more than 100 Anolis species, ranging from lanky lizards that perch in bushes, to stocky, long-legged lizards that live on tree trunks, to foot-long 'giants' that roam the upper branches of trees.\n\"Each body type is specialized for using different parts of a tree or bush,\" said Mahler.\nAlongside researchers from the University of Rochester, Harvard University, and the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center, Mahler wanted to understand how and when this wide range of shapes and sizes came to be.\nTo do that, the team used DNA and body measurements from species living today to reconstruct how they evolved in the past. In addition to measuring the head, limbs, and tail of over a thousand museum specimens representing nearly every Anolis species in the Greater Antilles -- including several Cuban species that were previously inaccessible to North American scientists -- they also used the Anolis family tree to infer what species lived on which islands, and when.\nBy doing so, they discovered that the widest variety of anole shapes and sizes arose among the evolutionary early-birds. Then as the number of anole species on each island increased, the range of new body types began to fizzle.\nLate-comers in lizard evolution underwent finer and finer tinkering as time went on. As species proliferated on each island, their descendants were forced to partition the remaining real estate in increasingly subtle ways, said co-author Liam Revell of the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center in Durham, NC.\n\"Over time there were fewer distinct niches available on each island,\" said Revell. \"Ancient evolutionary changes in body proportions were large, but more recent evolutionary changes have been more subtle.\"\nThe researchers saw the same trend on each island. \"The islands are like Petri dishes where species diversification unfolded in similar ways,\" said Mahler. \"The more species there were, the more they put the brakes on body evolution.\"\nThe study sheds new light on how biodiversity comes to be. \"We're not just looking at species number, we're also looking at how the shape of life changes over time,\" said Mahler.\nThe team's findings are published in the journal Evolution.\nRichard Glor of the University of Rochester and Jonathan Losos of Harvard University were also authors on this study.\nOther social bookmarking and sharing tools:\n- D.

{"text":"Outside of the academic environment, a harsh and seemingly ever-growing debate has appeared, concerning how mass media distorts the political agenda. Few would argue with the notion that the institutions of the mass media are important to contemporary politics. In the transition to liberal democratic politics in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe the media was a key battleground. In the West, elections increasingly focus around television, with the emphasis on spin and marketing. Democratic politics places emphasis on the mass media as a site for democratic demand and the formation of \u201cpublic opinion\u201d. The media are seen to empower citizens, and subject government to restraint and redress. Yet the media are not just neutral observers but are political actors themselves. The interaction of mass communication and political actors \u2014 politicians, interest groups, strategists, and others who play important roles \u2014 in the political process is apparent. Under this framework, the American political arena can be characterized as a dynamic environment in which communication, particularly journalism in all its forms, substantially influences and is influenced by it.\nAccording to the theory of democracy, people rule. The pluralism of different political parties provides the people with \u201calternatives,\u201d and if and when one party loses their confidence, they can support another. The democratic principle of \u201cgovernment of the people, by the people, and for the people\u201d would be nice if it were all so simple. But in a medium-to-large modern state things are not quite like that. Today, several elements contribute to the shaping of the public\u2019s political discourse, including the goals and success of public relations and advertising strategies used by politically engaged individuals and the rising influence of new media technologies such as the Internet.\nA naive assumption of liberal democracy is that citizens have adequate knowledge of political events. But how do citizens acquire the information and knowledge necessary for them to use their votes other than by blind guesswork? They cannot possibly witness everything that is happening on the national scene, still less at the level of world events. The vast majority are not students of politics. They don\u2019t really know what is happening, and even if they did they would need guidance as to how to interpret what they knew. Since the early twentieth century this has been fulfilled through the mass media. Few today in United States can say that they do not have access to at least one form of the mass media, yet political knowledge is remarkably low. Although political information is available through the proliferation of mass media, different critics support that events are shaped and packaged, frames are constructed by politicians and news casters, and ownership influences between political actors and the media provide important short hand cues to how to interpret and understand the news.\nOne must not forget another interesting fact about the media. Their political influence extends far beyond newspaper reports and articles of a direct political nature, or television programs connected with current affairs that bear upon politics. In a much more subtle way, they can influence people\u2019s thought patterns by other means, like \u201cgoodwill\u201d stories, pages dealing with entertainment and popular culture, movies, TV \u201csoaps\u201d, \u201ceducational\u201d programs. All these types of information form human values, concepts of good and evil, right and wrong, sense and nonsense, what is \u201cfashionable\u201d and \u201cunfashionable,\u201d and what is \u201cacceptable\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d. These human value systems, in turn, shape people\u2019s attitude to political issues, influence how they vote and therefore determine who holds political power.","id":"<urn:uuid:e07102a9-36b0-40bd-b081-74ec346f923a>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/politicstoday.biz\/10851\/do-mass-media-influence-the-political-behavior-of-citizens\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.964322269,"token_count":723,"score":3.203125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Washington, Aug 9 (IANS) The formation in the air of sulphuric acid, which smells like rotten eggs, is significantly impacting our climate and health, says a study.\nThe study led by Roy Lee Mauldin III, research associate at the University of Colorado-Boulder's atmospheric and oceanic sciences department, charts a previously unknown chemical pathway for the formation of sulphuric acid, which can trigger both increased acid rain and cloud formation as well as harmful respiratory effects on humans.\nSulphuric acid plays an essential role in the Earth's atmosphere, from the ecological impacts of acid precipitation to the formation of new aerosol particles, which have significant climatic and health effects. Our findings demonstrate a newly observed connection between the biosphere and atmospheric chemistry, Mauldin was quoted as saying in the journal Nature.\nMore than 90 percent of sulphur dioxide emissions are from fossil fuel combustion at power plants and other industrial facilities, says the US Environmental Protection Agency, according to a university statement.\nOther sulphur sources include volcanoes and even ocean phytoplankton. Sulphur dioxide reacts with hydroxide to produce sulphuric acid that can form acid rain, harmful to terrestrial and aquatic life on Earth.\nAirborne sulphuric acid particles, which form in a wide variety of sizes, play the main role in the formation of clouds, which can have a cooling effect on the atmosphere, Mauldin said.\nMost of the lab experiments for the study were conducted at the Leibniz-Institute for Tropospheric Research in Leipzig, Germany.","id":"<urn:uuid:597b3d2d-8580-4486-a845-d0f996cf51af>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/news.smashits.com\/833362\/Sulphuric-acid-formation-affects-climate-health.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9388685226,"token_count":329,"score":3.390625,"int_score":3}

The little port of San Francisco had become the focus of world migration. Captain Folsom, the staff quartermaster, having secured appointment as collector of the port, was on his way to becoming a millionaire.

{"text":"NOAA scientists agree the risks are high, but say Hansen overstates what science can really say for sure\nJim Hansen at the University of Colorado\u2019s World Affairs Conference (Photo: Tom Yulsman)\nSpeaking to a packed auditorium at the University of Colorado\u2019s World Affairs Conference on Thursday, NASA climatologist James Hansen found a friendly audience for his argument that we face a planetary emergency thanks to global warming.\nDespite the fact that the temperature rise has so far been relatively modest, \u201cwe do have a crisis,\u201d he said.\nWith his characteristic under-stated manner, Hansen made a compelling case. But after speaking with two NOAA scientists today, I think Hansen put himself in a familiar position: out on a scientific limb. And after sifting through my many pages of notes from two days of immersion in climate issues, I\u2019m as convinced as ever that journalists must be exceedingly careful not to overstate what we know for sure and what is still up for scientific debate.\nCrawling out on the limb, Hansen argued that global warming has already caused the levels of water in Lake Powell and Lake Mead \u2014 the two giant reservoirs on the Colorado River than insure water supplies for tens of millions of Westerners \u2014 to fall to 50 percent of capacity. The reservoirs \u201cprobably will not be full again unless we decrease CO2 in the atmosphere,\u201d he asserted.\nHansen is arguing that simply reducing our emissions and stabilizing CO2 at about 450 parts per million, as many scientists argue is necessary, is not nearly good enough. We must reduce the concentration from today\u2019s 387 ppm to below 35o ppm.\n\u201cWe have already passed into the dangerous zone,\u201d Hansen said. If we don\u2019t reduce CO2 in the atmosphere, \u201cwe would be sending the planet toward an ice free state. We would have a chaotic journey to get there, but we would be creating a very different planet, and chaos for our children.\u201d Hansen\u2019s argument (see a paper on the subject here) is based on paleoclimate data which show that the last time atmospheric CO2 concentrations were this high, the Earth was ice free, and sea level was far higher than it is today.\n\u201cI agree with the sense of urgency,\u201d said Peter Tans, a carbon cycle expert at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration here in Boulder, in a meeting with our Ted Scripps Fellows in Environmental Journalism. \u201cBut I don\u2019t agree with a lot of the specifics. I don\u2019t agree with Jim Hansen\u2019s naming of 350 ppm as a tipping point. Actually we may have already gone too far, except we just don\u2019t know.\u201d\nA key factor, Tans said, is timing. \u201cIf it takes a million years for the ice caps to disappear, no problem. The issue is how fast? Nobody can give that answer.\u201d\nMartin Hoerling, a NOAA meteorologist who is working on ways to better determine the links between climate change and regional impacts, such as drought in the West, pointed out that the paleoclimate data Hansen bases his assertions on are coarse. They do not record year-to-year events, just big changes that took place over very long time periods. So that data give no indication just how long it takes to de-glaciate Antarctica and Greenland.\nHoerling also took issue with Hansen\u2019s assertions about lakes Powell and Mead. While it is true that \u201cthe West has had the most radical change in temperature in the U.S.,\u201d there is no evidence yet that this is a cause of increasing drought, he said.\nFlows in the Colorado River have been averaging about 12 million acre feet each year, yet we are consuming 14 million acre feet. \u201cWhere are we getting the extra from? Well, we\u2019re tapping into our 401K plan,\u201d he said. That would be the two giant reservoirs, and that\u2019s why their water levels have been declining.\n\u201cWhy is there less flow in the river?\u201d Hoerling said. \u201cLow precipitation \u2014 not every year, but in many recent years, the snow pack has been lower.\u201d And here\u2019s his almost counter-intuitive point: science shows that the reduced precipitation \u201cis due to natural climate variability . . . We see little indication that the warming trend is affecting the precipitation.\u201d\nIn my conversation with Tans and Hoerling today, I saw a tension between what they believe and what they think they can demonstrate scientifically.\n\u201cI like to frame the issue differently,\u201d Tans said. \u201cSure, we canot predict what the climate is going to look like in a couple of dcades. There are feedbacks in the system we don\u2019t understand. In fact, we don\u2019t even know all the feedbacks . . . To pick all this apart is extremely difficult \u2014 until things really happen. So I\u2019m pessimistic.\u201d\nThere is, Tans said, \u201ca finite risk of catastrophic climate change. Maybe it is 1 in 6, or maybe 1 in 20 or 1 in 3. Yet if we had a risk like that of being hit by an asteroid, we\u2019d know what to do. But the problem here is that we are the asteroid.\u201d\nTans argues that whether or not we can pin down the degree of risk we are now facing, one thing is obvious: \u201cWe have a society based on ever increasing consumption and economic expectations. Three percent growth forever is considered ideal. But of course it\u2019s a disaster.\u201d\nHoerling says we are living like the Easter Islanders, who were faced with collapse from over consumption of resources but didn\u2019t see it coming. Like them, he says, we are living in denial.\n\u201cI think we are in that type of risk,\u201d Tans said. \u201cBut is that moving people? It moves me. But I was already convinced in 1972.\u201d","id":"<urn:uuid:f9441dcc-dc2a-4077-aac8-1b49394182e2>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.cejournal.net\/?p=1590","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.964948535,"token_count":1273,"score":2.546875,"int_score":3}

{"text":"This is an old lecture by linguist and political activist Noam Chomsky (professor at MIT) given at UC Berkeley in 2003. For that evening in the Charles M. and Martha Hitchcock Lecture series, Chomsky examined biolinguistics - the study of relations between physiology and speech.\nA second video of Chomsky is featured below, which is the second half of this talk. Fair warning - this is not easy material - Chomsky is speaking to people who are well-versed in this field.\nChomsky has been one the most influential scholars over the last three or four decades - between 1980 and 1992, he was cited as a source more than any other living scholar, and ranked eighth overall.\nAs background for this lecture, Wikipedia offers a good summary of his influence in linguistics (below the video).\nChomskyan LinguisticsChomskyan linguistics, beginning with his Syntactic Structures, a distillation of his Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory (1955, 75), challenges structural linguistics and introduces transformational grammar. This approach takes utterances (sequences of words) to have a syntax characterized by a formal grammar; in particular, a context-free grammar extended with transformational rules.\nPerhaps his most influential and time-tested contribution to the field, is the claim that modeling knowledge of language using a formal grammar accounts for the \"productivity\" or \"creativity\" of language. In other words, a formal grammar of a language can explain the ability of a hearer-speaker to produce and interpret an infinite number of utterances, including novel ones, with a limited set of grammatical rules and a finite set of terms. He has always acknowledged his debt to P\u0101\u1e47ini for his modern notion of an explicit generative grammar although it is also related to rationalist ideas of a priori knowledge.\nIt is a popular misconception that Chomsky proved that language is entirely innate and discovered a \"universal grammar\" (UG). In fact, Chomsky simply observed that while a human baby and a kitten are both capable of inductive reasoning, if they are exposed to exactly the same linguistic data, the human child will always acquire the ability to understand and produce language, while the kitten will never acquire either ability. Chomsky labeled whatever the relevant capacity the human has which the cat lacks the \"language acquisition device\" (LAD) and suggested that one of the tasks for linguistics should be to figure out what the LAD is and what constraints it puts on the range of possible human languages. The universal features that would result from these constraints are often termed \"universal grammar\" or UG.\nThe Principles and Parameters approach (P&P)\u2014developed in his Pisa 1979 Lectures, later published as Lectures on Government and Binding (LGB)\u2014makes strong claims regarding universal grammar: that the grammatical principles underlying languages are innate and fixed, and the differences among the world's languages can be characterized in terms of parameter settings in the brain (such as the pro-drop parameter, which indicates whether an explicit subject is always required, as in English, or can be optionally dropped, as in Spanish), which are often likened to switches. (Hence the term principles and parameters, often given to this approach.) In this view, a child learning a language need only acquire the necessary lexical items (words, grammatical morphemes, and idioms), and determine the appropriate parameter settings, which can be done based on a few key examples.\nProponents of this view argue that the pace at which children learn languages is inexplicably rapid, unless children have an innate ability to learn languages. The similar steps followed by children all across the world when learning languages, and the fact that children make certain characteristic errors as they learn their first language, whereas other seemingly logical kinds of errors never occur (and, according to Chomsky, should be attested if a purely general, rather than language-specific, learning mechanism were being employed), are also pointed to as motivation for innateness.\nMore recently, in his Minimalist Program (1995), while retaining the core concept of \"principles and parameters,\" Chomsky attempts a major overhaul of the linguistic machinery involved in the LGB model, stripping from it all but the barest necessary elements, while advocating a general approach to the architecture of the human language faculty that emphasizes principles of economy and optimal design, reverting to a derivational approach to generation, in contrast with the largely representational approach of classic P&P.\nChomsky's ideas have had a strong influence on researchers of the language acquisition in children, though many researchers in this area such as Elizabeth Bates and Michael Tomasello argue very strongly against Chomsky's theories, and instead advocate emergentist or connectionist theories, explaining language with a number of general processing mechanisms in the brain that interact with the extensive and complex social environment in which language is used and learned.\nHis best-known work in phonology is The Sound Pattern of English (1968), written with Morris Halle (and often known as simply SPE). This work has had a great significance for the development in the field. While phonological theory has since moved beyond \"SPE phonology\" in many important respects, the SPE system is considered the precursor of some of the most influential phonological theories today, including autosegmental phonology, lexical phonology and optimality theory. Chomsky no longer publishes on phonology.","id":"<urn:uuid:249ad1f9-cb8f-42dd-b955-c4814c5a2452>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/integral-options.blogspot.com\/2012\/04\/noam-chomsky-language-and-mind.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9454671144,"token_count":1107,"score":2.75,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Best Known For: Catalan painter Joan Mir\u00f3 combined abstract art with Surrealist fantasy to create his lithographs, murals, tapestries, and sculptures for public spaces.\nBorn to the families of a goldsmith and a cabinet-maker, he grew up in the Barri G\u00f2tic neighborhood of Barcelona. His father was Miquel Mir\u00f3 Adzerias and his mother was Dolores Ferr\u00e0. He began drawing classes at the age of seven at a private school at Carrer del Regomir 13, a medieval mansion. In 1907 he enrolled at the fine art academy at La Llotja, to the dismay of his father. He studied at the Cercle Art\u00edstic de Sant Lluc and he had his first solo show in 1918 at the Dalmau Gallery, where his work was ridiculed and defaced. Inspired by Cubist and surrealist exhibitions from abroad, Mir\u00f3 was drawn towards the arts community that was gathering in Montparnasse and in 1920 moved to Paris, but continued to spend his summers in Catalonia.\nHe said, \u201cThe painting rises from the brushstrokes as a poem rises from the words. The meaning comes later.\u201d\nAfter overcoming a serious bout of typhoid fever in 1911, Miro decided to devote his life entirely to painting by attending the school of art taught by Francesc Gal\u00ed. He studied at La Lonja School of Fine Arts in Barcelona, and in 1918 set up his first individual exhibition in the Dalmau Galleries, in the same city. His works before 1920 (the date of his first trip to Paris) reflect the influence of different trends, like the pure and brilliant colors used in Fauvism, shapes taken from cubism, influences from folkloric Catalan art and Roman frescos from the churches.\nHis trip to Paris introduced him to and developed his trend of surrealist painting. In 1921, he showed his first individual exhibition in Paris, at La Licorne Gallery. In 1928, he exhibited with a group of surrealists in the Pierre Gallery, also in Paris, although Mir\u00f3 was always to maintain his independent qualities with respect to groups and ideologies.\nFrom 1929-1930, Mir\u00f3 began to take interest in the object as such, in the form of collages. This was a practice which was to lead to his making of surrealist sculptures. His tormented monsters appeared during this decade, which gave way to the consolidation of his plastic vocabulary. He also experimented with many other artistic forms, such as engraving, lithography, water colors, pastels, and painting over copper. What is particularly highlighted from this period, are the two ceramic murals which he made for the UNESCO building in Paris (The Wall of the Moon and the Wall of the Sun, 1957-59).\nJoan Miro UNESCO Mural- \u201cThe Moon and The Sun\u201d\nIt was at the end of the 60\u00b4s when his final period was marked and which lasted until his death. During this time, he concentrated more and more on monumental and public works. He was characterized by the body language and freshness with which he carried out his canvasses, as well as the special attention he paid to material and the stamp he received from informalism. He concentrated his interest on the symbol, not giving too much importance to the representing theme, but to the way the symbol emerged as the piece of work. Miro had a very eccentric style that is the embodiment of his unique approach to his artwork.\nIn 1976 the Joan Mir\u00f3 Foundation Centre of Contemporary Art Study was officially opened in the city of Barcelona and in 1979, four years before his death, he was named Doctor Honoris Causa by the University of Barcelona.\nHe said, \u201cFor me an object is something living. This cigarette or this box of matches contains a secret life much more intense than that of certain human beings. \u201c","id":"<urn:uuid:6d056ffa-c919-45e1-9379-3d3afab6d15d>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/waldina.com\/tag\/paris\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9865276217,"token_count":800,"score":2.8125,"int_score":3}

{"text":"United Nations Special Commission\nUnited Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) was an inspection regime created by the United Nations to ensure Iraq's compliance with policies concerning Iraqi production and use of weapons of mass destruction after the Gulf War. Between 1991 and 1997 its director was Rolf Ek\u00e9us; from 1997 to 1999 its director was Richard Butler.\nUnited Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) was an inspection regime created with the adoption of United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 in April 1991 to oversee Iraq's compliance with the destruction of Iraqi chemical, biological, and missile weapons facilities and to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s efforts to eliminate nuclear weapon facilities all in the aftermath of the Gulf War. The UNSCOM inspection regime was packaged with several other UN Security Council requirements, namely, that Iraq\u2019s ruling regime formally recognize Kuwait as an independent state and pay out war reparations for the destruction inflicted in the Gulf War, including the firing of Kuwaiti oil supplies and destruction of public infrastructure. Until the UN Security Council saw that Iraq\u2019s weapons programs had been aborted and Iraqi leaders had allowed monitoring systems to be installed, the UN\u2019s aforementioned sanctions would continue to be imposed on Iraq.\nThe commission found corroborating evidence that Rihab Rashid Taha, an Iraqi microbiologist educated in England, had produced biological weapons for Iraq in the 1980s. The destruction of proscribed weapons and the associated facilities was carried out mainly by Iraq, under constant supervision by UNSCOM.\nInspectors withdrew in 1998, and disbanded the following year amid allegations that the United States had used the commission's resources to spy on the Iraqi military. Weapons inspector Scott Ritter later stated that Operation Rockingham had cherry-picked evidence found by the United Nations Special Commission; evidence, he says, that was later used as part of the casus belli for the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nThe successor of the United Nations Special Commission was the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission.\nThe United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) was headed by Rolf Ek\u00e9us and later Richard Butler. During several visits to Iraq by the United Nations Special Committee (UNSCOM), set up after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait to inspect Iraqi weapons facilities, weapons inspectors were told by Rihab Rashid Taha that the al-Hakam germ warfare center was a chicken-feed plant. \"There were a few things that were peculiar about this animal-feed production plant,\" Charles Duelfer, UNSCOM's deputy executive chairman, later told reporters, \"beginning with the extensive air defenses surrounding it.\"\nThe powers given to UNSCOM inspectors in Iraq were: \u201cunrestricted freedom of movement without advance notice in Iraq\u201d; the \u201cright to unimpeded access to any site or facility for the purpose of the on-site inspection...whether such site or facility be above or below ground\u201d; \u201cthe right to request, receive, examine, and copy any record data, or information...relevant to\u201d UNSCOM\u2019s activities; and the \u201cright to take and analyze samples of any kind as well as to remove and export samples for off-site analysis.\nAcceptance of the intrusion of the UNSCOM\u2019s inspectors on the part of the Iraqi regime was slow coming. But with the threat of punitive military action looming from the international community, and particularly the U.S., Saddam Husain begrudgingly allowed UNSCOM\u2019s inspectors into the country to begin their work.\nBetween 1991 and 1995, UN inspectors uncovered a massive program to develop biological and nuclear weapons. A large amount of equipment was confiscated and destroyed. Iraq by and large refused to cooperate with UNSCOM and its inspections as mandated by UN SC Res. 687 until June 1992, ten months after deadline, at which time the Iraqi government submitted \u201cfull, final and complete reports\u201d on all of its weapons of mass destruction programs. These reports, however, were found to be incomplete and deficient, and at the same time UN inspectors were subjected to harassment and threats on the part of the Iraqi regime.\nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 699 was also passed in 1991, declaring that Iraq was responsible for all funding of UNSCOM\u2019s inspections in Iraq.\nIn 1995, UNSCOM's principal weapons inspector Dr. Rod Barton showed Taha documents obtained by UNSCOM from Israel that showed the Iraqi government had just purchased 10 tons of growth media from a British company called Oxoid. Growth media is a mixture of sugar, proteins and minerals that allows microscopic life to grow. It is used in hospitals, where swabs from patients are placed in dishes containing growth media for diagnostic purposes. Iraq's hospital consumption of growth media was just 200 kg a year; yet in 1988, Iraq imported 39 tons of it.\nShown this evidence by UNSCOM, Taha admitted to inspectors that she had grown 19,000 litres of botulism toxin; 8,000 litres of anthrax; 2,000 litres of aflatoxins, which can cause liver cancer; clostridium perfringens, a bacterium that can cause gas gangrene; and ricin, a castor bean derivative which can kill by inhibiting protein synthesis. She also admitted conducting research into cholera, salmonella, foot and mouth disease, and camel pox, a disease that uses the same growth techniques as smallpox, but which is safer for researchers to work with. It was because of the discovery of Taha's work with camel pox that the US and British intelligence services feared Saddam Hussein may have been planning to weaponize the smallpox virus. Iraq had a smallpox outbreak in the 1970s and UNSCOM scientists believe the government would have retained contaminated material.\nUNSCOM learned that, in August 1990, after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Taha's team was ordered to set up a program to weaponize the biological agents. By January 1991, a team of 100 scientists and support staff had filled 157 bombs and 16 missile warheads with botulin toxin, and 50 bombs and five missile warheads with anthrax. In an interview with the BBC, Taha denied the Iraqi government had weaponized the bacteria. \"We never intended to use it,\" she told journalist Jane Corbin of the BBC's Panorama program. \"We never wanted to cause harm or damage to anybody.\" UNSCOM found the munitions dumped in a river near al-Hakam. UNSCOM also discovered that Taha's team had conducted inhalation experiments on donkeys from England and on beagles from Germany. The inspectors seized photographs showing beagles having convulsions inside sealed containers.\nThe al-Hakam germ warfare center, headed by the British-educated Iraqi biologist Dr. Rihab Rashid Taha, was blown up by UNSCOM in 1996. According to a 1999 report from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, the normally mild-mannered Taha exploded into violent rages whenever UNSCOM questioned her about al-Hakam, shouting, screaming and, on one occasion, smashing a chair, while insisting that al-Hakam was a chicken-feed plant.\nIraq charged that the commission was a cover for US espionage and refused UNSCOM access to certain sites, such as Baath Party headquarters. Although Ek\u00e9us has said that he resisted attempts at such espionage, many allegations have since been made against the agency commission under Butler, charges which Butler has denied. Within the UN establishment in Iraq, UNSCOM was not without its critics, with the UN's humanitarian staff informally calling the inspectors 'UN-Scum'. In return, the UN's humanitarian staff were called \"bunny-huggers\".\nAlso in 1996, the Iraqi ruling regime agreed to the terms of United Security Council Resolution 986, an oil-for-supplies agreement in which Iraq was allowed to sell $2 billion worth of oil every six months as a ways to purchase supplies for its increasingly impoverished and malnourished population. This agreement also allowed the UN to oversee the use and management of oil revenues, and to see that some of the funds went to pay war reparations and for the work of UNSCOM in Iraq during this period. The distribution of supplies purchased with oil revenues was also to be supervised by UN inspectors to ensure fair and equal distribution throughout the Iraqi population.\n 1998 Airstrikes\nSecurity Council Meeting On the evening of 15 December 1998 the Security Council convened to consider two letters from weapons inspectors. The IAEA report by Mohamed El Baradei stated that Iraq \"has provided the necessary level of cooperation to enable... [our] activities to be completed efficiently and effectively\". The UNSCOM report, authored by Richard Butler, deplored the restrictions, lack of disclosure, and concealment. While conceding that \"[i]n statistical terms, the majority of the inspections of facilities and sites under the ongoing monitoring system were carried out with Iraq's cooperation,\" his letter listed a number of instances where unspecificed \"undeclared dual-capable items\" had been discovered, and where inspections had been held up so that buildings could be cleared of sensitive material.\nSince Operation Desert Fox had already begun at the time of the meeting (just hours after the inspectors had been evacuated), the Security Council debated about who was to blame for the military action, rather than whether they should authorize it. The Iraqi representative said:\n|\u201c||I speak to you now while rockets and bombs are falling on the cities and the villages of Iraq... At a time when the Security Council... was discussing [the] reports..., and before the Council reached any conclusion on this subject, the United States and Britain launched their attack against Iraq. The two Powers requested a suspension of the informal meeting of the Security Council and their pretext for aggression was that one of the two reports -- the UNSCOM report -- emphasized the lack of full cooperation by Iraq with UNSCOM... Time and again we have warned against the partiality and lack of objectivity of the United Nations Special Commission... The UNSCOM Executive Chairman singled out in his report yesterday five incidents out of a total of 300 inspection operations... The exaggerated uproar about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction is nothing but a great lie.||\u201d|\nThe Russian ambassador added:\n|\u201c||We believe that although there are certain problems..., the current crisis was created artificially... On the night of 15 December this year, [Butler] presented a report that gave a distorted picture of the real state of affairs and concluded that there was a lack of full cooperation on the part of Iraq. That conclusion was not borne out by the facts. Without any consultations with the Security Council, Richard Butler then evacuated the entire Special Commission staff from Iraq. At the same time, there was an absolutely unacceptable leak of the report to the communications media, which received the text before the members of the Security Council themselves... It is symbolic that precisely at the time when Richard Butler... was attempting to defend the conclusions reached in his report, we were informed about the strike against Iraq, and the justification for that unilateral act was precisely the report which had been presented by the Executive Chairman of the Special Commission.||\u201d|\nThe view of the Council was split, with several countries placing the responsibility on Iraq. The United States declared that \"Iraq's policy of unremitting defiance and non-compliance necessitated the resort to military force\". The United Kingdom stated that the objectives of the action were \"to degrade Iraq's capability to build and use weapons of mass destruction, and to diminish the military threat Iraq poses to its neighbours. The targets chosen, therefore, are targets connected with his military capability, his weapons of mass destruction and his ability to threaten his neighbours.\"\n 1999: End of UNSCOM\nIn December 1999, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1284, replacing UNSCOM with the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission. Four countries \u2014 among them Russia, France and China \u2014 abstained from voting on Res. 1284, which led the Iraqi regime to reject the resolution because they saw the resolution as a way for the UN to claim Iraq as a \u201cprotectorate.\u201d\nUNSCOM\u2019s intention of identifying and eliminating Iraqi weapons programs resulted in numerous successes, illustrating the \u201cvalue of a system approach to biological arms verification,\u201d as former UNSCOM Historian Stephen Black has written. But the overall effect of the UN sanctions on Iraqi in the 1990s proved devastating to an already crumbling country. Malnutrition rates among Iraqis increased and infant mortality rates soared, exacting a heavy toll on the people of Iraq not part of the ruling regime\u2019s patrimonial \u201cshadow state.\u201d\n Allegations of CIA infiltration of UNSCOM\nEvidence that UNSCOM had been used by US intelligence to penetrate Iraqi security and track President Saddam Hussein's movements emerged in January 1999. An investigation by the Washington Post claimed that CIA engineers, working as UN technicians, installed equipment to spy on Iraqi sites without Butler's knowledge, and that this explained the unidentified \"burst transmissions\" that had been noted by the inspectors.\nFormer UN weapons inspector Scott Ritter later accused some UNSCOM personnel of spying, and also alleged that the purpose of the spying was to target Saddam in the bombing. Butler, on the other hand, denied allegations that foreign intelligence agencies \"piggybacked\" UNSCOM and questioned the factual accuracy of several of Ritter's statements.\nOn 31 August 1998, Ritter said: \"Iraq still has proscribed weapons capability. There needs to be a careful distinction here. Iraq today is challenging the special commission to come up with a weapon and say where is the weapon in Iraq, and yet part of their efforts to conceal their capabilities, I believe, have been to disassemble weapons into various components and to hide these components throughout Iraq. I think the danger right now is that without effective inspections, without effective monitoring, Iraq can in a very short period of time measure the months, reconstitute chemical biological weapons, long-range ballistic missiles to deliver these weapons, and even certain aspects of their nuclear weaponization program.\"\nAlmost a year later, in June 1999, Ritter responded to an interviewer saying: \"When you ask the question, 'Does Iraq possess militarily viable biological or chemical weapons?' the answer is no! It is a resounding NO. Can Iraq produce today chemical weapons on a meaningful scale? No! Can Iraq produce biological weapons on a meaningful scale? No! Ballistic missiles? No! It is 'no' across the board. So from a qualitative standpoint, Iraq has been disarmed. Iraq today possesses no meaningful weapons of mass destruction capability.\nButler resigned from UNSCOM on 30 June 1999.\n See also\n- In Shifting Sands: The Truth About Unscom and the Disarming of Iraq - documentary film directed by Scott Ritter\n- Iraq disarmament crisis and Iraq disarmament timeline 1990\u20132003\n- UNSCOM personnel: Rolf Ek\u00e9us, Richard Butler (diplomat), Charles A.

{"text":"September 3rd, 2012\n03:56 PM ET\nThe Empowered Patient is a regular feature from CNN Senior Medical News Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen that helps put you in the driver's seat when it comes to health care.\nWhile there's no ironclad way to keep hantavirus away, there are steps you can take to minimize the chances that it will hurt you or your family.\nThe virus is relatively rare: Only 602 cases have been reported in the United States since 1993, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Recently, six cases of hantavirus were reported among people who visited Yosemite National Park in California. Two of those infected people died.\nHowever, it's very deadly: About half of all people who get hantavirus die of it, according to the National Institutes of Health.\nThough some people do get it from camping, such as the recent Yosemite cases, many more people contract hantavirus in their own homes, according to the CDC.\nThe virus is spread by rodent droppings and urine. Here are some tips from the CDC and NIH for keeping hantavirus at bay:\n1. Seal holes inside and outside your home to keep rodents out.\n2. Trap rodents around your home.\n3. While camping, sleep on ground cover and a pad.\n4. When opening an unused cabin, open all doors and windows. Leave for 30 minutes, and when you return, spray disinfectant and then leave for another 30 minutes.\n5. Know the signs: Early symptoms include chills, fever and muscle aches. Within one or two days, it becomes hard to breathe.\nSeptember 3rd, 2012\n03:00 PM ET\nWe all know stress is bad for you, but just how bad?\nIt would be unethical to intentionally subject people to extreme psychological duress in the name of science. But ongoing military operations offer opportunities to see what happens to people exposed to stressful situations.\nResearchers in the Netherlands found the brains of soldiers who go into combat show impairment in function and structure upon returning, but that these effects largely go away over time.\nAbout this blog\nGet a behind-the-scenes look at the latest stories from CNN Chief Medical Correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen and the CNN Medical Unit producers.

{"text":"The process of accretion is important in the formation of planets, stars, and black holes; it is also believed to power some of the most energetic phenomena in the universe. In an accretion disc, the accretion rate is controlled by the outward transport of angular momentum. Collisional processes like friction or viscosity are typically too small to account for the observed rates, and it is universally believed that astrophysical accretion discs are turbulent. However the origin of this turbulence is not clear since discs with velocity profiles close to Keplerian are stable to infinitesimal perturbations. In the early nineties it was realized that the stability picture changes dramatically if magnetic fields or nonlinear effects are present. In this talk I will describe how some of these issues can be discussed within the framework of the flow of a conducting fluid between coaxial rotating cylinders. I will also describe some of the experiments that are on the way to study these flows as well as the computational efforts to clarify the nature of the ensuing turbulent transport.\nANL Physics Division Colloquium Schedule","id":"<urn:uuid:9bf53c84-d3fd-428b-bc4b-63892ad85de5>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.phy.anl.gov\/events\/Colloquium\/classified\/abstracts-2005\/jan20.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9486660957,"token_count":215,"score":2.625,"int_score":3}
{"text":"In statistics, a confidence region is a multi-dimensional generalization of a confidence interval. It is a set of points in an n-dimensional space, often represented as an ellipsoid around a point which is an estimated solution to a problem, although other shapes can occur.\nThe confidence region is calculated in such a way that if a set of measurements were repeated many times and a confidence region calculated in the same way on each set of measurements, then a certain percentage of the time, on average, (e.g. 95%) the confidence region would include the point representing the \"true\" values of the set of variables being estimated. However, unless certain assumptions about prior probabilities are made, it does not mean, when one confidence region has been calculated, that there is a 95% probability that the \"true\" values lie inside the region, since we do not assume any particular probability distribution of the \"true\" values and we may or may not have other information about where they are likely to lie.\nThe case of independent, identically normally-distributed errors \nSuppose we have found a solution to the following overdetermined problem:\nwhere Y is an n-dimensional column vector containing observed values, X is an n-by-p matrix which can represent a physical model and which is assumed to be known exactly, is a column vector containing the p parameters which are to be estimated, and is an n-dimensional column vector of errors which are assumed to be independently distributed with normal distributions with zero mean and each having the same unknown variance .\nA joint 100(1 - ) % confidence region for the elements of is represented by the set of values of the vector b which satisfy the following inequality:\nwhere the variable b represents any point in the confidence region, p is the number of parameters, i.e. number of elements of the vector and s2 is an unbiased estimate of equal to\nThe above inequality defines an ellipsoidal region in the p-dimensional Cartesian parameter space Rp. The centre of the ellipsoid is at the solution . According to Press et al., it's easier to plot the ellipsoid after doing singular value decomposition. The lengths of the axes of the ellipsoid are proportional to the reciprocals of the values on the diagonals of the diagonal matrix, and the directions of these axes are given by the rows of the 3rd matrix of the decomposition.\nWeighted and generalised least squares \nNow let us consider the more general case where some distinct elements of have known nonzero covariance (in other words, the errors in the observations are not independently distributed), and\/or the standard deviations of the errors are not all equal. Suppose the covariance matrix of is , where V is an n-by-n nonsingular matrix which was equal to in the more specific case handled in the previous section, (where I is the identity matrix,) but here is allowed to have nonzero off-diagonal elements representing the covariance of pairs of individual observations, as well as not necessarily having all the diagonal elements equal.\nIt is possible to find a nonsingular symmetric matrix P such that\nIn effect, P is a square root of the covariance matrix V.\nThe least-squares problem\ncan then be transformed by left-multiplying each term by the inverse of P, forming the new problem formulation\nA joint confidence region for the parameters, i.e. for the elements of , is then bounded by the ellipsoid given by:\nNonlinear problems \nConfidence regions can be defined for any probability distribution. The experimenter can choose the significance level and the shape of the region, and then the size of the region is determined by the probability distribution. A natural choice is to use as a boundary a set of points with constant (chi-squared) values.\nOne approach is to use a linear approximation to the nonlinear model, which may be a close approximation in the vicinity of the solution, and then apply the analysis for a linear problem to find an approximate confidence region. This may be a reasonable approach if the confidence region is not very large and the second derivatives of the model are also not very large.\nSee Uncertainty Quantification#Methodologies for forward uncertainty propagation for related concepts.\nSee also \n- Draper and Smith (1981, p. 94)\n- Draper and Smith (1981, p. 108)\n- Draper and Smith (1981, p. 109)\n||This article includes a list of references, but its sources remain unclear because it has insufficient inline citations.

{"text":"Songwriting For Beginners: \u2018Just Enough\u2019 Music TheoryBy Jeff Oxenford \u2022 Category: How To Write Songs, Songwriting Articles\n(This is an article in the series \u201cSongwriting For Beginners\u201d. We are filing the series under the Songwriting Basics category.)\nQuestion: How do you stop a guitarist from playing?\nAnswer: Put music in front of him.\nThat\u2019s me. I can\u2019t read music and I doubt I ever will. However, over the last three years, I\u2019ve learned just enough about music theory to be dangerous. What I\u2019ve found is that by understanding some basic concepts, I\u2019ve been able to find that next chord I was always searching for.\nThe first step in understanding is that most songs are played in a single key and that the chords in the come from that key. The formula (i.e. what order) you use for the chords is what make up the song. For example, blues often uses the 1, 4, and 5 chords. If you\u2019re playing blues in E, the chords are E, A, B (or B7). The blues progression in the key of C, uses C, F, and G.\nIf you can understand the table below, you\u2019ve got the majority of theory you need.\n|1 (root)||2||3||4||5||6||7||8 (root)|\n|Major||minor||Minor||Major||Major or Dominant||Minor||Diminished||Major|\nHere\u2019s how to understand this table:\nGuitar frets are in half (H) step intervals. In other words, moving up one fret is moving up a half (H) step. Moving up 2 frets is a whole (W) step.\nNotes and intervals\nOn a guitar, the open string and the 12th fret on the same string are the same note (just different octave). If you look at the A string, the notes are:\n|\u00c2 NOTE||A||A# or Bb||B||C||C# or Db||D||D#orEb||E||F||F#orGb||G||G#OrAb||A|\nTo go from A to B is a whole (W) step. To go from A to A# (or Bb) is a half (H) step.\nAlso, note that for B to C and E to F, there is only a half step. There is no B# (Cb) or E# (Fb).\nThe major scale has the following intervals, W W H W W W H. (do, rae, me fae, so la, te, do)\nApplying this formula, the notes in the A major scale are: A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A. As seen on the guitar the A scale looks like:\nPractice tip \u2013 On any string of the guitar, apply the formula W, W, H, W, W, W, H. In other words pick the string: Open, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12. You\u2019ve just played a major scale.\nNumbers for the Notes\nWe describe the notes in a scale by their numbers (1 \u2013 8).\nWhen your playing in the Key of A, A is the 1 note, B is 2 \u2013 You get the idea.\nChords in the major scale\nTo find chords that will work in the key of A, take the root notes from the scale and use the A chord type A from the table below:\n|Major||minor||Minor||Major||Major or Dom||Minor||Diminished||Major|\nThe 1, 4 and 5 chord are major chords (A, D, E).\nThe 2, 3 and 6 chords are minor (Bm, etc.)\nThe 7th chord is diminished\nBelow is a listing of the chords in the major scale for all keys.\u00c2 Use the table by following a row:\nPractice tip: Take one row and play the chords in order. It should like the major scale. Then try the 1, 4 and 5 chords. Move to another row and try the 1, 4 , 5. It should sound pretty familiar.\nHow do you use this in Songwriting?\nMost songs in folk, rock and blues primarily use combinations of the 1, 4, 5 chords. The 6 and 3 are used often and sometimes the 2. The 7 chord (diminished) isn\u2019t used as often, but it does have a very distinctive sound.\n*(Other books use roman numerals, so be ready to see I, IV, V).\nFor example: The formula for 12 bar blues is Blues in A \u2013 the formula is 1,1,1,1,4,4,1,1,5,4,1,5 (each played for a four count).\nCheck out more Songwriting Basics\nRepublished with permission by Jeff\u2019s Songwriting","id":"<urn:uuid:07b4c608-be60-4766-ba46-c0273bce6f23>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.bloggingmuses.com\/songwriting-for-beginners-just-enough-music-theory\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.8379480243,"token_count":1071,"score":3.15625,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Nuclear Energy in France\nNuclear energy is the cornerstone of french energy policy. In the \u201870s France chose to develop nuclear as its base load electricity source as a response to the oil crisis and assure its energy independence.\nNuclear Electricity Production: France currently counts 58 commercial nuclear reactors in operation responsible for producing 80% of French domestic electricity. As a comparison, the 104 US reactors produces 20% of US electricity.Despite scarce natural resources, France has reached an energy independence of 50% thanks to its strategic choice for nuclear energy.\nEnvironment: As well as providing safe and reliable energy, nuclear helps to reduce French greenhouse gas emissions by avoiding the release of 31 billions tones of carbon dioxide (contrary to coal or gas generation) and making France the less carbon emitting country within the OECD. As a leader in nuclear energy, France has developed clean technology for radioactive waste disposal. Reprocessing currently allows France to recover valuable elements from spent fuels and permit a significant reduction of high level waste and lead to safer and optimized containment, for final radioactive waste disposition. French nuclear power plants produces only 10 g\/year\/inhabitant of highly radioactive waste.\nInternational Cooperation and research: France is one of the forerunner in nuclear research and participates in numerous international cooperation programs alongside the United States such as the development of the next generation of nuclear power plants (Gen IV) and the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) that will be built in Cadarache, South of France.\nThe French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA)\nThe French Atomic Energy Commission is a public body established in October 1945 by General de Gaulle. It constitutes a power of expertise and proposition for the authorities. A leader in research, development and innovation, the CEA is involved in three main fields:\nIt develops and acquires the technological building blocks necessary to the development of the nuclear reactors of the future (Contribution to Generation IV and GNEP research),\nIt contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emission with its research on hydrogen, fuel cells, biomass, energy storage\u2026,\nIt supports the nuclear utilities in France by optimizing the nuclear power plants of the French nuclear fleet and by optimizing the fuel cycle,\nIt offers safe and economically viable technical solutions for managing nuclear waste,\nIt conducts fundamental research in climate and environmental sciences, high energy physics, astrophysics, fusion, nanosciences\u2026\nInformation and Health technologies:\nIt tackles micro and nano-technologies for telecommunication and nuclear medicine for radiotherapy and medical imaging,\nIt researches programs on biotechnology, molecular labelling, biomolecular engineering and structural biology,\nIt shares its knowledge and know-how through education and training through the National Institute for Nuclear Sciences and Technologies (INSTN),\nIt manages over 300 priority patents and is active in the creation of clusters.\nDefense and National Security:\nIt conceives, builds, maintains then dismantles the nuclear warhead of the French deterrence force,\nIt helps to fight against nuclear, biological and chemical weapons (NRBC program).\nThe missions of the CEA are similar to the Department of Energy in the United States. The CEA has a network of counselor or representatives in French Embassies around the world (see joint map).\nThe French Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN)\nCreated in 2006, from the former DSIN (Directorate for the Safety of Nuclear Facilities), the French Nuclear Safety Authority is an independent administrative authority which is tasked with regulating nuclear safety and radiation protection in order to protect workers, patients, the public and the environment from the risks involved in nuclear activities. It also contributes to informing the public. Like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in the United States, it carries out inspections and may pronounce sanctions, up to and including suspension of operation of an installation.\nFrench Institute for Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN)\nCreated in 2001 by merging the Protection and Nuclear Safety Institute (IPSN) and the Ionizing radiations Protection Office (OPRI), the Institute for Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety is a public establishment of an industrial and commercial nature placed under the joint authority of the Ministries of the Environment, Health, Industry, Research and Defense. It is the expert in safety research and specialized assessments into nuclear and radiological risk serving public authorities whose work is complementary to the ASN.\nIts scope of activities includes:\nenvironment and response,\nhuman radiological protection,\nresearch on the prevention of major accidents,\npower reactor safety,\nfuel cycle facility safety,\nresearch installation safety,\nwaste management safety;\nnuclear defense expertise.\nNational radioactive Waste Management Agency (ANDRA)\nCreated in 1991, the French National Agency for Radioactive Waste Management is a public industrial and commercial organization that operates independently of waste producers. It is responsible for the long-term management of radioactive waste produced in France under the supervision of the French Ministries for Energy, Research and the Environment. It can be compared to a certain extent to the Office for Nuclear Waste of the Department of Energy in the United States.\nAndra also pursues industrial, research, and information activities as it designs and implements disposal solutions suited to each category of radioactive waste:\nthe collection, conditioning, disposal of radioactive waste from small producers (hospitals, research centers, industry),\nspecification of waste packages for disposal,\ndisposal in suited sites,\nmonitoring of closed disposal facilities,\nresearch programs for long-lived and high level activity waste, especially through the operation of an underground research laboratory in a deep clay formation\u2026\nGeneral Directorate for Energy and Climate (DGEC)\nThe General Directorate for Energy and Climate represents the government and is part of the Office of the Department for Ecology and Sustainable Development. It defines the French nuclear policy. The DGEC takes care of the energy supply, the security of supply, oil refining and logistics, nuclear industry, and coal and mines.\nConsequently, its activities include:\nthe design and implement energy and raw material supply policy,\nto ensure opening of electricity and gas markets,\ntrack key energy and raw material sectors,\nto oversee enterprises and public institutions in energy sector,\nto ensure compliance with rules and regulations governing energy sector,\nto participate in European and international energy projects and working groups,\nto provide economic, environmental, and fiscal expertise on energy matters.\nThe Rise of Nuclear Power Generation in France.","id":"<urn:uuid:f5c220a7-7276-4cf2-9208-33679d478b1f>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/ambafrance-us.org\/spip.php?article949&xtor=AL-13","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9123350382,"token_count":1305,"score":3.125,"int_score":3}

The method of pacing a pacemaker patient's heart rate using a magnet-controlled implantable pulse generator to adjust the stimulation rate from a resting rate to an exercise rate and vice versa, comprising the steps of\nmaintaining the stimulation rate of said pulse generator at said resting rate,\ninitiating a command signal to reset the stimulation rate of said pulse generator to said exercise rate after an adjustable programmed delay period following said command signal, and\nreturning the stimulation rate of said pulse generator to said resting rate in increments following a predetermined interval of time at said exercise rate.\nThe present invention relates generally to medical devices, and more particularly to implantable artificial cardiac pacemakers adapted to provide patient-variable stimulation rates appropriate to a condition of exercise by the patient.\nThe resting heart rate of sinus rhythm, that is, the rate determined by the spontaneously rhythmic electrophysiologic property of the heart's natural pacemaker, the sinus node, is typically in the range from about 65 to about 85 beats per minute (bpm) for adults. Disruption of the natural cardiac pacing and propagation system may occur with advanced age and\/or cardiac disease, and is often treated by implanting an artificial cardiac pacemaker in the patient to restore and maintain the resting heart rate to the proper range.\nIn its simplest form, an implantable pacemaker for treatment of bradycardia (abnormally low resting rate, typically below 60 beats per minute (bpm)) includes an electrical pulse generator powered by a self-contained battery pack, and a catheter lead including at the distal end a stimulating cathodic electrode electrically coupled to the pulse generator. The lead is implanted intravenously to position the cathodic electrode in stimulating relation to excitable myocardial tissue in the selected chamber on the right side of the patient's heart. The pulse generator unit is surgically implanted in a subcutaneous pouch in the patient's chest, and has an integral electrical connector to receive a mating connector at the proximal end of the lead. In operation of the pacemaker, the electrical pulses are delivered (typically, on demand) via the lead\/electrode system, including an anodic electrode such as a ring behind the tip for bipolar stimulation or a portion of the pulse generator case for unipolar stimulation, and the body tissue and fluid, to stimulate the excitable myocardial tissue.\nPacemakers may operate in different response modes, such as asynchronous (fixed rate), inhibited (stimulus generated in absence of specified cardiac activity), or triggered (stimulus delivered in presence of specified cardiac activity). Further, present-day pacers range from the simple fixed rate device that offers pacing with no sensing (of cardiac activity) function, to fully automatic dual chamber pacing and sensing functions (so-called DDD pacemakers) which may provide a degree of physiologic pacing by at least a slight adjustment of heart rate according to varying metabolic conditions in a manner akin to the natural pacing of the heart. Thus, some DDD pacemaker patients experience an increased pacing rate with physical exertion, with concomitantly higher cardiac output, and thereby, an ability to handle low levels of exercise. Unfortunately, a significant percentage of the pacemaker patient population, who suffer from atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation or sick-sinus syndrome, for example, cannot obtain the benefit of exercise-responsive pacing with conventional atrial-triggered pacemakers. Moreover, the DDD-type pacemakers are complex and costly to manufacture, which is reflected in a higher price to the patient.\nIt is a principal object of the present invention to provide a relatively simple and inexpensive pacemaker which provides pacing at a desired resting rate, and which is subject to limited control by the patient to provide a desired exercise rate for a preset period of time following which the pacemaker returns to the resting rate.\nVarious types of rate responsive pacemakers have been proposed which would sense a physiological parameter that varies as a consequence of physical stress, such as respiration, blood oxygen saturation or blood temperature, or merely detect physical movement, and correspondingly adjust the pacing rate. Many of these rate responsive pacemakers may also be relatively complex, and therefore expensive to the patient.\nThe present invention is directed toward a low cost pacemaker which can be adjusted at will by the patient, subject to the limited amount of control programmed into the device by the physician for that patient. According to the invention, patient control is manifested by bringing an external magnet into proximity with an implanted reed switch associated with the pacemaker. Of course, limited magnet control has been afforded to the patient in the past for some purposes, such as to enable transtelephonic monitoring of the pacemaker functions. Also, techniques are presently available which permit external adjustment of the stimulation rate of the pacemaker after implantation, as by means of a programming unit available to the physician. For obvious reasons, it is undesirable to give the patient the same latitude to control his pacemaker.\nIn U.S. Pat. No. 3,623,486, Berkovits disclosed a pacemaker adapted to operate at either of two stimulation rates, and switchable from one to the other by the physician using an external magnet. In this manner, the physician would be able to control the pacer mode and rate according to the needs of the particular patient. The purpose, in part, was to provide a pacemaker which had some adaptability to the patient's requirements. However, once set by the physician, the selected resting rate was maintained for that patient by the implanted pacer.\nAnother technique for external adjustment of pacing rate by the physician is found in the disclosures of U.S. Pat. No. 3,198.195 to Chardack, and U.S. Pat. No. 3,738,369 to Adams et al. In each, rate control is exercised by inserting a needle through a pacemaker aperture beneath the patient's skin to adjust a mechanism. In the Adams et al. disclosure, the needle is used to change the position of a magnet within the paper to actuate a rate-controlling reed switch.\nIn U.S. Pat. No. 3,766,928, Goldberg et al. describe an arrangement for continuous adjustment of rate by a physician using an external magnet that cooperates with a magnet attached to the shaft of a rate potentiometer in the implanted pacemaker, to provide the initial setting of pacing rate desirable for the particular patient.\nMore recent proposals offer the patient limited control over the pacing rate. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,365,633, Loughman et al. disclose a pacemaker programmer which is conditioned by the physician to give the patient the capability to select any of three distinct rates: for sleep, for an awake resting state, and for exercise. The programmer generates a pulsating electromagnetic field, and allows the patient to select any of those three modes with an abrupt change in rate when the coil pod of the programmer is positioned over the implanted pacemaker. It is, of course, necessary to have the programmer at hand in order to change the stimulation rate, and the use of the device in public can be a source of extreme embarassment to the patient.\nIn U.S. Pat. No. 4,545,380, Schroeppel describes a technique for manual adjustment of rate control contrasted with the activity sensing, automatic rate control disclosed by Dahl in U.S. Pat. No. 4,140,132. According to the Schroeppel patent, a piezoelectric sensor and associated circuitry are combined with the implanted pulse generator of the pacemaker to allow the patient to change from a resting rate to a higher rate by sharp taps on his chest near the site of the piezoelectric sensor. Such an arrangement requires that the sensor be sufficiently sensitive to respond to the patient's sharp taps, and yet be insensitive to the everyday occurrences the patient encounters while undergoing normal activities and which could otherwise result in false triggerings. These include presence in the vicinity of loud noise such as is generated by street traffic, being jostled in a crowd, experiencing bumps and vibrations while riding in a vehicle, and the like. Further, even when controlled in the manner described, this type of switching results in an abrupt, non-physiological change of rate.\nAccordingly, it is another object of the present invention to provide a pacemaker which is capable of being controlled externally by the patient to assume exercise and non-exercise rate modes, in a manner that allows discreet and yet reliable control.\nYet another object of the invention is to provide a cardiac pacemaker whose stimulation rate is controllable by and according to a schedule selected by the patient.\nBriefly, according to the present invention a cardiac pacemaker is manually controllable by the patient to preset time intervals of operation at a relatively high (exercise) rate and lower (resting) rate according to the patient's own predetermined schedule of exercise and rest. An important aspect of the invention is that the pulse generator may be implemented to undergo an adjustment of stimulation rate from a fixed resting rate of, say, 75 bpm, to a preselected exercise rate of, say, 120 bpm, following a predetermined period of time after activation by the patient using an external magnet, that is, after a predetermined delay following a patient-initiated command signal, and to remain at the higher rate for a preselected time interval. Thus, the patient may effectively \"set a clock\" in his pacemaker to elevate his heart rate at the time and for the duration of a scheduled exercise session, such as a game of tennis. Moreover, he may activate the pacemaker in this manner in the privacy of his own home well in advance of the exercise session.\nAccording to another aspect of the invention, the pulse generator is implemented to return automatically to the resting rate at the expiration of the preselected exercise rate time interval. Hence, the patient need not carry his magnet with him to readjust the pacer to the resting rate at the completion of the scheduled exercise session. According to this aspect, after operating at the elevated stimulation rate for a time interval preselected to be suitable for the exercise session, say, one hour, the generator resets itself to return to the initial resting rate.\nAccording to another feature of the invention, the rate is incremented and decremented in steps from one rate setting to the other to avoid abrupt changes, and therefore to provide a more physiological rate control than has heretofore been available in manually controlled pacemakers.\nA further feature of the invention is that the pulse generator may be activated to disable the exercise rate command at any time after it has been given, including that to produce an early conclusion to an already-commenced exercise session. For example, if a scheduled tennis game or bicycling run is called off by the patient's partner after the patient has programmed in the higher rate, he need merely apply the magnet in proximity to the implanted pulse generator again to cancel the previous command and maintain the fixed resting rate. Similarly, if the exercise session is shortened, the rate may be returned to the resting rate by simply applying the magnet over the pulse generator.\nThe above and still further objects, aspects, features and attendant advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the field to which the invention applies from a consideration of the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment thereof, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawing, in which:\nFIG. 1 is a block circuit diagram of a pulse generator unit of a cardiac pacemaker according to a preferred embodiment of the invention.\nReferring now to FIG. 1, an implantable pulse generator unit 10 includes a pulse generator 12 and batteries 15 housed in a biocompatible metal case 17. Pulse generator 12 is implemented to be rate limited to generate output pulses at rates up to either of two low\/high limit rates--for example, 75 pulses per minute (ppm) and 120 ppm, respectively--and to be incremented from the lower rate to the higher rate and decremented from the higher rate to the lower rate under the control of an up\/down counter 18 associated with the pulse generator 12 in unit 10. Counter 18 may be set by application of a voltage level to its \"up\" input to commence counting toward the higher rate, and thereby to incrementally step the pulse repetition frequency up to that rate, and may be reset by application of a voltage level to its \"down\" input to commence counting toward the lower rate, and thereby decrementally step the pulse repetition frequency down to that rate. This is accomplished under the control of set and reset output voltage levels generated by a flip-flop circuit 21 also housed in case 17. The pulse generator unit 10 also includes a reed switch 25 which is actuable by placement of a magnet 27, external to the skin of the patient in whom the unit 10 is implanted, in proximity to case 17.\nReed switch 25, when actuated, serves to enable a delay timer 29 in unit 10. The delay timer responds to the enabling input to commence timing of its preset time delay interval. At the end of the delay interval, delay timer 29 produces a pulse for application to the flip-flop 21. Subsequent actuation of the reed switch before the timer 29 has timed out serves to disable the timer and reset it in preparation for a subsequent enabling signal from the reed switch. If timer 29 has already timed out before the reed switch is again actuated, the timer will respond to the disabling input, when the reed switch is actuated, to produce another pulse for application to the flip-flop 21. The flip-flop is thereupon reset and produces its reset output voltage level.\nThe set and reset output voltage levels of flip-flop 21 are also applied respectively to \"set\" and \"reset\" inputs of an interval timer 30. Upon being set, the interval timer commences timing out a predetermined time interval, and, at the expiration of that interval, generates a pulse for application to flip-flop 21. Upon being reset, the interval timer 30 is returned to the start of the predetermined time interval in preparation for initiating the timing of that interval on receipt at its \"set\" input of the next set output voltage level from the flip-flop.\nThe preset time period of delay timer 29 and the predetermined time interval of interval timer 30 are programmable by the physician according to the desires and needs of the particular patient. If, for example, the patient has a regularly scheduled early morning brisk walking session of one hour with friends, and resides near the starting point of the walk, the time period of the delay timer 29 may be programmed to be fifteen minutes. The time interval of the interval timer 30 is programmed to be one hour in length.\nIn operation, the pulse generator produces output pulses at the resting rate prescribed (and programmed) by the physician for the particular patient--in this exemplary embodiment, a resting rate of 75 bpm. The pulses are delivered to the stimulating cathodic electrode 35 in the right ventricle of the heart 40 via a lead 42, the reference electrode (anode) and the body tissue and fluids, according to the mode in which the pacemaker is designed to operate.\nIn the preferred embodiment, the pacemaker continues to operate at that rate unless and until the patient elects to initiate the exercise rate cycle. To do so, the patient places the magnet 27 in proximity to the implanted pulse generator unit 10 at about fifteen minutes prior to the appointed time for the exercise session, as a command to actuate reed switch 25. The patient may then choose to leave the magnet at home or take it along in the glove compartment of his car, since actuation of the reed switch has enabled the delay timer 29 and nothing more need be done by the patient to enable the pacemaker to commence the exercise rate at the expiration of the preset delay period.\nBefore the end of that period the patient has arrived at the starting point for the exercise session, and at the end of the delay period, the delay timer applies a pulse to flip-flop 21 which responds by generating a set output voltage level. The set voltage is applied to both the \"up\" input of counter 18 and the \"set\" input of interval timer 30. Accordingly, the counter commences its count, preferably at a relatively slow rate of, say, ten counts per minute, and correspondingly incrementally steps the pulse generator 12 output rate up to the upper rate limit of 120 ppm, and thereby gradually increases the patient's heart rate from 75 bpm to 120 bpm as the patient commences to exercise. Hence, the patient's heart rate and cardiac output are now at levels adequate for the patient to carry out the exercise session.\nThe pulse generator continues to supply pulses at the upper rate limit until interval timer 30, which commenced its predetermined time interval with the application of the set input voltage, times out, whereupon the interval timer produces an output pulse which is applied to flip-flop 21 to reset the latter. The flip-flop responds by providing a reset output voltage level for application to the \"down\" input of counter 18 and the \"reset\" input of the interval timer. Accordingly, the counter decrementally steps the pulse repetition frequency of the pulse generator down, preferably at the ten pulses per minute rate, to the lower rate limit of 75 ppm corresponding to a heart rate of 75 bpm. In this manner, the patient's heart rate is reduced gradually from the exercise rate to the resting rate at a time commensurate with the end of the exercise session. Also, the resetting of the interval timer by the set output voltage level of the flip-flop assures that the timer is ready to commence timing its predetermined interval on receipt of the next \"set\" input.\nIn the event that the exercise session is called off at any time after the delay timer 29 has been enabled and before the interval timer has timed out, the patient need merely place the magnet 27 once again in proximity to the implanted pulse generator unit. If the delay timer has not yet timed out, it is disabled by the actuation of the reed switch, and hence, flip-flop 21 remains reset, interval timer 30 remains reset, counter 18 is at its low count, and pulse generator 12 is at its lower rate limit. If the delay timer has timed out, it produces an output pulse in reponse to the disabling input from the reed switch, thereby resetting the flip-flop, resetting the interval timer, returning counter 18 toward its low count and pulse generator 12 toward its lower rate limit. To that end, delay timer 29 is provided with an internal clock such that, once enabled to time out the delay interval, it cannot be again enabled to do so until the passage of a preselected time interval, which is one hour and fifteen minutes in the present example, unless it has first been disabled during that overall interval. Of course, to cancel the exercise rate, the patient must have the magnet available to issue the second command but, as previously noted, once the delay timer is enabled through actuation of the reed switch the magnet may be kept in a convenient location, such as the glove compartment of the patient's car, to allow cancellation of the exercise rate in private.\nAlthough a presently preferred embodiment has been described herein, it will be evident to those skilled in the art that variations and modifications of the preferred embodiment may be carried out without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, it is intended that the present invention shall be limited only to the extent required by the appended claims and the applicable rules of law.","id":"<urn:uuid:c4bc0780-21b4-4fac-b167-2758ef4d0cbb>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.google.de\/patents\/US4884575","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.923384726,"token_count":5452,"score":2.546875,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Guest Author - Heather Thomas\nIn most wild species, birds display dominance within the flock to determine their place or roll within that flock. Males display and vocalize to win their choice of female. The term \u201cpecking order\u201d comes from natural bird behavior. Dominant behavior is natural and expected in the wild. We must be cautious, as humans, not to project our sense of right and wrong onto our feathered companions.\nSimilar to birds that still live in the wild, your bird may be only a few generations removed from the wild and will display natural behavior tendencies. Understanding these basic characteristics helps you understand how to interact with your bird and creates a happier flock experience for all.\nThe Lunging or Biting Bird\nOne must be cautious to label \u201cbad\u201d behavior as dominant behavior. Lunging and biting are most often caused by fear. Changing a bird\u2019s environment too drastically such as cage placement, a new cage, rearranging the furniture in a room or even something as simple as changing the drapery on the window next to their cage can cause even a friendly bird to become seemingly aggressive. It is important to consider environmental changes before labeling your bird\u2019s behavior as dominant. Typical dominant behavior that manifests itself as biting or lunging would be a bird that loves to sit only on your shoulder and bites you when you attempt to remove them. Protecting a favorite person or place in your home by lunging or biting at others who happen to come too close would also be correctly labeled as dominant behavior.\nThe Bully Bird\nYou may have a situation where you keep more than one bird in a cage. If you have a flock that works well together you will be able to tell who the dominant male is but it will not adversely affect your flock. If you have a dominant male that is a bully, you may observe him forcing other birds off of their perch or guarding a food dish and not letting anyone else eat from it. In worst-case scenarios, your bully will single out a victim and force that bird to dwell at the bottom of the cage or even injure and possibly kill this weaker bird. If you have a dominant bully, it is best to remove him from the cage and keep him in a cage by himself or with his mate.\nThe Anti-Social Bird\nAs much as you try your bird has no interest in becoming your friend. This bird often flutters around its cage to avoid your hand or takes to flight to escape your reach. I find this behavior often typical of a bird with unclipped wings. There are people who keep birds that believe it is cruel to clip a bird\u2019s wings. I will cover this topic in depth at a later time but here will touch on effects not clipping your bird\u2019s wings has on dominance. By the very act of keeping a bird as a pet, you are choosing to take this wonderful winged creature and transform it into your friend or companion. If you take this action, it changes the purpose of the animal. If you allow your bird to retain the ability of flight, you are permitting your bird to escape your reach and do whatever it wants. This may be fine, if you want a wild bird as a pet. However, if you want a friendly bird, you want a bird dependent on you, a bird that does not fly away just because it wants to.\nFor a well-mannered bird, keep the flock mentality where you are the dominant bird. If you want a bird that respects you, you must maintain dominance. This is not achieved by cruel discipline. Observe your bird and be consistent with your expectations and interaction within your flock. Do not allow unacceptable dominant behavior to take root in your avian friend.","id":"<urn:uuid:41e51805-6ce5-4e0e-812d-f25764378578>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.bellaonline.com\/articles\/art18014.asp","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9609537721,"token_count":762,"score":3.40625,"int_score":3}

{"text":"From Oxford University Press:\nThere is a broad consensus among scholars that the idea of human rights was a product of the Enlightenment but that a self-conscious and broad-based human rights movement focused on international law only began after World War II. In this narrative, the nineteenth century's absence is conspicuous--few have considered that era seriously, much less written books on it. But as Jenny Martinez shows in this novel interpretation of the roots of human rights law, the foundation of the movement that we know today was a product of one of the nineteenth century's central moral causes: the movement to ban the international slave trade. Originating in England in the late eighteenth century, abolitionism achieved remarkable success over the course of the nineteenth century. Martinez focuses in particular on the international admiralty courts, which tried the crews of captured slave ships. The courts, which were based in the Caribbean, West Africa, Cape Town, and Brazil, helped free at least 80,000 Africans from captured slavers between 1807 and 1871. Here then, buried in the dusty archives of admiralty courts, ships' logs, and the British foreign office, are the foundations of contemporary human rights law: international courts targeting states and non-state transnational actors while working on behalf the world's most persecuted peoples--captured West Africans bound for the slave plantations of the Americas. Fueled by a powerful thesis and novel evidence, Martinez's work will reshape the fields of human rights history and international human rights law.\n- Forces us to fundamentally rethink the origins of human rights activism\n- Filled with fascinating stories of captured slave ship crews brought to trial across the Atlantic world in the nineteenth century\n- Shows how the prosecution of the international slave trade was crucial to the development of modern international law","id":"<urn:uuid:ec191471-6e59-4d54-afce-3997eab364e0>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/pesd.stanford.edu\/publications\/slavetrade_humanrightslaw\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.945527792,"token_count":358,"score":3.046875,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Our Constitution offers us \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,\" but we can't pursue anything if we are unhealthy. Yet, health disparities in the United States are a fact of life. African Americans have shorter lives than Whites for three reasons. One has to do with income and poverty. Poor people [27 percent of African Americans are poor, compared to about 10 percent of Whites] have less money and less access, often having to make a choice between medical treatment, food to eat, prescription drugs and rent.\nThe second barrier to health equality is proximity and access. In other words, African Americans are more likely to be located a distance from hospitals. There are fewer hospitals and clinics in the 'hood than in wealthier areas. And some preventative clinics (such as a diabetes clinic in Harlem) have been eliminated because of money. Another barrier to health access is simply attitudes. Those health providers who have racial and other attitudes choose to treat patients differently. According to a study by the Institutes of Medicine (IOM), an African American or Latino man who goes to an emergency room with a broken bone is less likely to get painkillers than a White man.\nPart of this year's presidential debate revolves around the issue of health care. Mitt Romney, the architect of Massachusetts health care system that resembles the Obama health plan, is now jogging (at least that's healthy) away from himself, rejecting plans he once championed. Or is he? Recently, he said he would preserve some aspects of Obamacare, not others. I am sure you have been asked to name three people, living or dead you'd like to dine with. I'd like to dine with Mitt Romney and the truth \u2013 at the same time.\nThose who understand health care challenges understand that the world won't be the way it was and our health care system needs to be revised. President Obama, offering the first tweak in the social insurance contract in 80 years, has done so by passing health care legislation that pushes the envelope. It's not enough, but it is better than it has ever been.\nStill, the system will be strained by the aging baby boomers, and challenged by the need to offer patient education and preventative services to prevent costly interventions. The uncoupling of employment and health insurance allows more people the opportunity to deal with their health. Thus, the health care industry will be pushed to absorb people who are newly empowered to deal with their health.\nToo many folks ignore their health because they have few options. I spent last weekend in the Mississippi Delta: in Cleveland, Mound Bayou and Ruleville. I traveled there with members of the Sojourner Truth Statue Committee, under the direction of Pat Reid-Merritt, the Richard Stockton University Distinguished Professor who led the national committee. We had the pleasure of offering a statue of Fannie Lou Hamer to the Ruleville community in the peaceful garden where Fannie Lou Hamer and her husband \"Pap\" are buried. There are so many reasons that the moment was moving, especially the presence of hundreds of children who joined the celebration.\nFannie Lou Hamer, an international treasure, a tribute to audacity, a woman who endured a brutal beating because she exercised her right to register and vote, died at 60 from untreated breast cancer. This woman climbed every mountain, cleared every hurdle, stood down the biggest and the baddest in the majority community and in her own. Still, she did not have access to the health care that might have saved her life. She could stare down the Democratic National Committee on national television, but she could not stare down the breast cancer that killed her because she neither had the dollars nor the access to treatment.\nFannie Lou Hamer died in 1977 at the age 60. Imagine what we might be as a community had she been able to live to 80, or to 90. She might have been able to shape and influence our movements, offer advice and influence, keep the Democratic Party accountable, and perhaps explore independent politics and the ways Republicans might be engaged in the struggle for freedom.\nWe don't know what she would have done, but we know that she died too early. That's why I believe that health care is a civil right. If we have the right to a life with liberty and the pursuit of happiness, we have the right to be healthy enough to pursue happiness. The fight for the presidency is partly a fight for the pursuit of health and happiness.

{"text":"The machete blades turned red with heat in the fire that the rubber workers built on a Liberia plantation, Thomas Unnasch remembers from a visit in the 1980s.\nThis was how the men tried to quell the intense itchiness that comes with river blindness, a rare tropical disease.\n\"You can imagine how bad the itching must be, that running a red-hot machete up and down your back would be a relief, but it was,\" said Unnasch, whose laboratory works on diagnostic tests for the disease.\nAbout 18 million people have river blindness worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, but more than 99% of cases of this disease are found in Africa. It goes by the technical name \"onchocerciasis,\" and it spreads through small black flies that breed in fast-flowing, highly oxygenated waters. When an infected fly bites a person, it drops worm larvae in the skin, which can then grow and reproduce in the body.\nUnlike malaria, river blindness is not fatal, but it causes a \"miserable life,\" said Moses Katabarwa, senior epidemiologist for the Atlanta-based Carter Center's River Blindness Program, which has been leading an effort to eliminate the disease in the Americas and several African countries.\nSome strains cause blindness, while others come with more severe skin disease. With time, generally all strains of the disease can lead to rough \"lizard\" skin, depigmented \"leopard skin\" and hanging groins. Another big problem among patients is itching, which happens when the worms die inside a person.\nIn southwest Uganda, the locals call the disease \"Obukamba,\" referring to the symptoms of distorted skin appearance and itchiness, Katabarwa said. In western Uganda, he said, \"the fly is called 'Embwa fly' or dog fly, for it bites like a dog!\"\nThere is no vaccine for river blindness, but there is a drug, called ivermectin that paralyzes and kills the offspring of adult worms, according to the Mayo Clinic. It may also slow the reproduction of adult female worms, so there are fewer of them in the skin, blood and eyes. The pharmaceutical company Merck has been donating the treatment, under the brand name Mectizan, since 1985.\nGreat strides have been made against this disease. In the Americas, it was eliminated in Colombia in 2007 and in Ecuador in 2009.","id":"<urn:uuid:415cd5cc-0228-4449-a777-4a0bb2194449>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.4029tv.com\/news\/health\/Fighting-river-blindness\/-\/8897344\/18384038\/-\/item\/0\/-\/o7f20pz\/-\/index.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9593093395,"token_count":502,"score":3.15625,"int_score":3}

(June 2012)|\n|Arnold Henry Guyot|\nArnold Henry Guyot\n|Born||September 28, 1807\nBoudevilliers, Canton of Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland\n|Died||February 8, 1884\nPrinceton, New Jersey, United States\nGuyot was born at Boudevilliers, near Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland. He was educated at Chaux-de-Fonds, then at the college of Neuch\u00e2tel. In 1825, he went to Germany, and resided in Karlsruhe where he met Louis Agassiz, the beginning of a lifelong friendship. From Karlsruhe he moved to Stuttgart, where he studied at the gymnasium. He returned to Neuch\u00e2tel in 1827. He determined to enter the ministry and started at the University of Berlin to attend lectures. While pursuing his studies, he also attended lectures on philosophy and natural science. His leisure was spent in collecting shells and plants, and he received an entr\u00e9e to the Berlin Botanical Garden from Humboldt. In 1835, he received the degree of Ph.D. from Berlin.\nIn 1838, at Agassiz's suggestion, he visited the Swiss glaciers and communicated the results of his six weeks' investigation to the Geological Society of France. He was the first to point out certain important observations relating to glacial motion and structure. Among other things he noted the more rapid flow of the center than of the sides, and the more rapid flow of the top than of the bottom of glaciers; described the laminated or ribboned structure of the glacial ice; and ascribed the movement of glaciers to a gradual molecular displacement rather than to a sliding of the ice mass as held by de Saussure. He subsequently collected important data concerning erratic boulders.\nIn 1839, he became the colleague of Agassiz as professor of history and physical geography at the College of Neuch\u00e2tel (a.k.a. Neuch\u00e2tel Academy?). The suspension of that institution in 1848 caused Guyot to emigrate, at Agassiz's instance, to the United States, where he settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He delivered a course of lectures at the Lowell Institute which were afterward published as Earth and Man (Boston 1853). For several years the Massachusetts Board of Education retained his services as a lecturer on geography and methods of instruction to the normal schools and teachers' institutes.\nHe was occupied with this work until his appointment, in 1854, as professor of physical geography and geology at Princeton University, which office he retained until his death. He was also for several years lecturer on physical geography in the State Normal School in Trenton, New Jersey, and from 1861 to 1866 lecturer in the Princeton Theological Seminary. He also gave courses in the Union Theological Seminary, New York, and at Columbia College. He founded the museum at Princeton, many of the specimens of which are from his own collections.\nHis scientific work in the United States included the perfection of plans for a national system of meteorological observations. Most of these were conducted under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution. His extensive meteorological observations led to the establishment of the United States Weather Bureau, and his Meteorological and Physical Tables (1852, revised ed. 1884) were long standard.\nHis graded series of text-books and wall-maps were important aids in the extension and popularization of geological study in America. In addition to text-books, his principal publications were:\n- Earth and Man, Lectures on Comparative Physical Geography in its Relation to the History of Mankind (translated by Cornelius Conway Felton, 1849)\n- A Memoir of Louis Agassiz (1883)\n- Creation, or the Biblical Cosmogony in the Light of Modern Science (1884).\n- Johnson\u2019s New Universal Cyclopaedia (1876) - editor-in-chief along with Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard\nHe is the namesake of several geographical features, including Guyot Glacier in Alaska, Mount Guyot on the North Carolina and Tennessee border, and a different Mount Guyot in New Hampshire, as well as Mount Guyot on the Rocky Mountain Continental Divide in Colorado.

{"text":"Reports of a serious amount of corn planted in central and southern Illinois, and at least a sprinkling of acres planted in Indiana before the first official day of Spring has some people scratching their heads. Try to explain that to your grandfather or great-grandfather!\nEmerson Nafziger at the University of Illinois says it may mean this is an educational season because he can't remember this much corn planted so early. He also says that in all test results he can find, corn planted the last week of April typically slightly out yields corn planted in late March of early April.\nOther universities have shown similar data. However, Nafziger acknowledges it depends upon the weather conditions that come after planting and the year itself.\nHere's what we think is often left out of the equation, especially for farmers with large acreages to plant. While the data is what it is for late-April being an ideal planting time in the central Midwest, few people add this caveat. What if soil conditions are right now, and temperatures are right now, but it's too wet or too cool to plant the last week of April? What if the last week of April becomes the first week of May? During the past two seasons in much of Indiana, for example, the last week of April became the last week of May or the first two weeks of June.\nOne could argue that the proper comparison ought to be not the first of April planting vs. the last of April, but the first of April planting vs. planting the last week of May? Which corn is likely to yield more? Most university data and data form several seed companies, including Beck's Hybrids through their Practical Farm Research Demonstration plots, would say that anything planted in April has a higher percentage of yielding more than corn planted the last week of May.\nGiven that logic, who can blame someone who has watched their planter sit for four weeks straight in May for the past two years if they want to get some crop in the ground now? Of course if fair weather continues or if the last week of April is ideal, and you could guarantee that, it would make a difference. Farming doesn't come with guarantees.\nKen Scheeringa, an assistant climatologist at Purdue University, says warmer than normal weather is likely through April, although it may not be as extreme on the warm side as in March, as compared to normal. Rainfall is more of a fuzzy call. The real issue is that May and June aren't on the radar screen yet. Some who have ventured out into May still call for a cool, wet spring.\nSo is it wise or foolish to have corn planted now? It's your decision, and your money. For our money, it's a gamble either way. Perhaps experts should talk in terms of calculated risks and explain what-if scenarios when they lay out planting date options.","id":"<urn:uuid:d42b33fa-9c85-4d46-a240-2be2f8712ffe>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/farmprogress.com\/story-thoughts-early-planting-0-58427","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9811159968,"token_count":585,"score":2.8125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"My passion is studying early man, specifically how we became who we are. Is our violence an aberration or part and parcel of survival? No other mammal kills their own, but maybe\u2013as the alpha on the planet\u2013our greatest threat to our survival is our own species, so we\u2019re forced to destroy each other.\nWhat was lacking in H. Habilis that led to their extinction, to be replaced by the big-brained, scrawny Homo erectus? Habilis was preyed upon by species with bigger claws, sharper teeth and thicker skin. Habilis (and my friend Lyta) scavenged their left-overs, in between hiding from the imposing mammals that dominated the Plio-Pleistocene African savanna. But, eventually hiding wasn\u2019t enough and H. erectus took over (we don\u2019t know if they fought with each other or if habilis left \u2018with a whimper\u2019).\nH. erectus, with his longer lower limbs for running and walking efficiency, his bigger brain especially in the areas for planning and forethought (and speech depending upon whose research you\u2019re reading) was tall, thin, and barrel-chested, hardly daunting in a world of sabertooth cats, mammoth and giant sloths. Yet , it is he who spread from Africa to China, India, the Middle East, Java. It is he\u2013not predator cats or alligators\u2013who developed a highly adaptable culture allowing him to survive a wide range of climates and habitats.\nThat is the first of their firsts. Want more?\n- first appearance of systematic hunting.\n- first use of fire (though arguably no control of it)\n- first indication of extended childhood (thanks to the helplessness of their infants)\n- first indication of the ability to lead a more complex life (their Acheulian tools were sophisticated, their hunting was planned)\n- first to wear clothing (how else to survive Georgia and China)\n- first to create complex tools and weapons\nTheir faces were short but wide and the nose projected forward, hinting at the typical human external nose. They had a pronounced brow ridge. Their cranium was long and low and somewhat flattened at the front and back. The cranial bone was thicker than earlier hominids. Remnants show damage from being hit in the head by something like clubs or heavy rocks. Their arms and legs were also robust, with thicker bones and clear evidence of being heavily muscled. The suspicion is they were a more violent species than habilis. Is that why habilis disappeared? The tougher group survived and bred offspring with their thicker, more protective skulls.\nYou probably remember my friend Lyta is a Homo habilis (see her page). I\u2019ve lived her life through Otto\u2018s ability to \u2018see\u2019 into the past. Where other primates rest when they have enough to eat, she thinks and shares information with her band. Where most mammals sleep when they aren\u2019t hunting, playing or resting, Lyta worked\u2013knapped tools, collected food for a cache, planned. I have come to believe that her survival depended not so much on her physique (which was sorely lacking in that physical time) as what was inside of her: her courage, ability to plan ahead, strength of her convictions, what we call \u2018morals\u2019. These are very human traits that can\u2019t be preserved in bones and teeth. I wouldn\u2019t know they existed if not for Otto. I\u2019ve posted an excerpt from that research on Scribd.com (Born in a Treacherous Time).\nMy next project is to determine how man migrated throughout the world. Where did he get the courage? Was he forced out because he couldn\u2019t defend his territory? Or was it wanderlust? Was he a seeker, wanting more for his life? Did he get bored and need to challenge his constantly-growing brain?","id":"<urn:uuid:1a482eda-257a-44ed-9d36-645d7c2ae85a>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/delamagente.wordpress.com\/2009\/06\/22\/homo-habilis-vs-homo-erectus\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9721047282,"token_count":826,"score":3.046875,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Arctic meltdown not caused by nature\nRapid loss of Arctic sea ice - 80 per cent has disappeared since 1980 - is not caused by natural cycles such as changes in the Earth's orbit around the Sun, says Dr Karl.\nThe situation is getting rather messy with regard to the ice melting in the Arctic. Now the volume of the ice varies throughout the year, rising to its peak after midwinter, and falling to its minimum after midsummer, usually in the month of September.\nOver most of the last 1,400 years, the volume of ice remaining each September has stayed pretty constant. But since 1980, we have lost 80 per cent of that ice.\nNow one thing to appreciate is that over the last 4.7 billion years, there have been many natural cycles in the climate \u2014 both heating and cooling. What's happening today in the Arctic is not a cycle caused by nature, but something that we humans did by burning fossil fuels and dumping slightly over one trillion tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere over the last century.\nSo what are these natural cycles? There are many many of them, but let's just look at the Milankovitch cycles. These cycles relate to the Earth and its orbit around the Sun. There are three main Milankovitch cycles. They each affect how much solar radiation lands on the Earth, and whether it lands on ice, land or water, and when it lands.\nThe first Milankovitch cycle is that the orbit of the Earth changes from mostly circular to slightly elliptical. It does this on a predominantly 100,000-year cycle. When the Earth is close to the Sun it receives more heat energy, and when it is further away it gets less. At the moment the orbit of the Earth is about halfway between \"nearly circular\" and \"slightly elliptical\". So the change in the distance to the Sun in each calendar year is currently about 5.1 million kilometres, which translates to about 6.8 per cent difference in incoming solar radiation. But when the orbit of the Earth is at its most elliptical, there will be a 23 per cent difference in how much solar radiation lands on the Earth.\nThe second Milankovitch cycle affecting the solar radiation landing on our planet is the tilt of the north-south spin axis compared to the plane of the orbit of the Earth around the Sun. This tilt rocks gently between 22.1 degrees and 24.5 degrees from the vertical. This cycle has a period of about 41,000 years. At the moment we are roughly halfway in the middle \u2014 we're about 23.44 degrees from the vertical and heading down to 22.1 degrees. As we head to the minimum around the year 11,800, the trend is that the summers in each hemisphere will get less solar radiation, while the winters will get more, and there will be a slight overall cooling.\nThe third Milankovitch cycle that affects how much solar radiation lands on our planet is a little more tricky to understand. It's called 'precession'. As our Earth orbits the Sun, the north-south spin axis does more than just rock gently between 22.1 degrees and 24.5 degrees. It also \u2014 very slowly, just like a giant spinning top \u2014 sweeps out a complete 360 degrees circle, and it takes about 26,000 years to do this. So on January 4, when the Earth is at its closest to the Sun, it's the South Pole (yep, the Antarctic) that points towards the Sun.\nSo at the moment, everything else being equal, it's the southern hemisphere that has a warmer summer because it's getting more solar radiation, but six months later it will have a colder winter. And correspondingly, the northern hemisphere will have a warmer winter and a cooler summer.\nBut of course, \"everything else\" is not equal. There's more land in the northern hemisphere but more ocean in a southern hemisphere. The Arctic is ice that is floating on water and surrounded by land. The Antarctic is the opposite \u2014 ice that is sitting on land and surrounded by water. You begin to see how complicated it all is.\nWe have had, in this current cycle, repeated ice ages on Earth over the last three-million years. During an ice age, the ice can be three kilometres thick and cover practically all of Canada. It can spread through most of Siberia and Europe and reach almost to where London is today. Of course, the water to make this ice comes out of the ocean, and so in the past, the ocean level has dropped by some 125 metres.\nFrom three million years ago to one million years ago, the ice advanced and retreated on a 41,000-year cycle. But from one million years ago until the present, the ice has advanced and retreated on a 100,000-year cycle.\nWhat we are seeing in the Arctic today \u2014 the 80 per cent loss in the volume of the ice since 1980 \u2014 is an amazingly huge change in an amazingly short period of time. But it seems as though the rate of climate change is accelerating, and I'll talk more about that, next time \u2026\nPublished 27 November 2012\n\u00a9 2013 Karl S.

{"text":"Atlas Faust, MD\nDark Matter and Dark Energy\nThese are two words you often hear thrown around and more often that not I come across people who don\u2019t know precisely what they are or even that they are two quite different things. So here we go.\nWhen you take a look at a galaxy you see a certain characteristic known as gravitational lensing where light is warped in a certain way by mass. From this you can deduce an estimate of the mass of the galaxy. However when we compare this to the mass we estimated based on the concentration, size and distribution of visible mass within the galaxy we find the two numbers to be at odds and not only this but the greatest curving of space time is found in the spaces between objects where nothing can be seen. The difference in masses is believed to be caused by the elusive dark matter, so called because it warps spacetime like regular matter but is completely invisible (hence the dark). All in all dark matter constitutes 23% of the mass-energy density of the universe and a worrying 83% of the total amount of matter. The universe is made chiefly of stuff you cannot see.\nDark energy is also the answer to a problem, behaving somewhat like the x value in an algebraic equation we\u2019re forced to solve. The problem lays in the fact that the universe is continuing to expand at an ever increasing rate and we have no idea why.

{"text":"Here is how it was done in 1810...By a mechanical wiz, not a beginner - now show us how you'd do it with a few motors and a controller\nAnd I don't think that you'd put that old mechanical doll in the \"simple\" category?\nSimple it was not. Just imagine what it took to program it by cutting brass cams for each degree of freedom... Amazing is what I would call it.\nNow, back to the original problem - is this robot supposed to write random phrases or just a couple pre-programed things?\nOne of the tough parts would be the math - first, mathematically describing the path for the tip of the arm and then sorting out all of the joint angles as a function of time to get it to trace the desired path.\nOne way around the math would be to build the arm with position sensors and then just move the arm by hand along the desired paths and record the angles. Then, the recorded values could be used as the target positions for your arm controller (a simple PI controller is likely to be adequate if you didn't try to move the arm too fast). Create tables of time \/ position pairs to describe the paths for the arm.\nIf the arm was built with servos - that makes it more difficult to record the \"training\" movements because all the feedback is inside the servo's themselves. So, you would have to open up the servos and run wires back from the potentiometers to your micro-controller to record the servo positions as you train it. (And translate from the voltage from the pot to the pulsewidth sent to the servo to get that position - another training exercise where you command various pulsewidths and record the potentiometer output.)\nGetting a robot to generate nice cursive writing was a challenge in 1810, and can be a challenge today!","id":"<urn:uuid:0045912d-03d2-49b5-bc59-99f1b7edb280>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.societyofrobots.com\/robotforum\/index.php?topic=15354.msg110910","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9578601718,"token_count":383,"score":3.015625,"int_score":3}

Achieving consensus allows a distributed system to act as a single entity, with every individual node aware of and in agreement with the actions of the whole of the network.\nIn this article Henry tackles Two-Phase Commit, the protocol most databases use to arrive at a consensus for database writes.

Most cases of mouth cancer are caused by either smoking or chewing tobacco, or drinking alcohol.\nMouth lesions are common, but only 5 percent to 30 percent may turn into cancers. Until now, no test has been able to accurately detect which lesions will become cancerous. Many mouth cancers are diagnosed at later stages, when the chances of survival are greatly reduced.\n\"A sensitive test capable of quantifying a patient's cancer risk is needed to avoid the adoption of a 'wait-and-see' intervention,\" study lead investigator and test inventor Dr. Muy-Teck Teh said in a university news release. \"Detecting cancer early, coupled with appropriate treatment, can significantly improve patient outcomes, reduce mortality and alleviate long-term public health care costs.\"\nAlthough this study shows that the test is effective for early cancer detection, further clinical trials are needed to evaluate its long-term clinical benefits.\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more about mouth and other types of oral cancer.\nSOURCE: Queen Mary, University of London, news release, Oct. 4, 2012\nCopyright (c) 2012 HealthDay.

{"text":"This insightful research by respected Israeli scholar Nurit Peled-Elhanan will confirm what Palestinian researchers have always known: Israel's prevailing culture of racism, fundamentalism, support for war crimes, and apartheid against Palestinians is mainly a product of an educational system that indoctrinates Jewish-Israeli students with militant colonial values and extreme racism that turn them into \"monsters\" once in uniform.\nGuardian: Academic claims Israeli school textbooks contain bias \"Nurit Peled-Elhanan of Hebrew University says textbooks depict Palestinians as 'terrorists, refugees and primitive farmers\"\n\"Peled-Elhanan, a professor of language and education at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, has studied the content of Israeli school books for the past five years, and her account, Palestine in Israeli School Books: Ideology and Propaganda in Education, is to be published in the UK this month. She describes what she found as racism\u2013 but, more than that, a racism that prepares young Israelis for their compulsory military service.\n\"People don't really know what their children are reading in textbooks,\" she said. \"One question that bothers many people is how do you explain the cruel behaviour of Israeli soldiers towards Palestinians, an indifference to human suffering, the inflicting of suffering.

The most important finding in the books she studied \u2013 all authorised by the ministry of education \u2013 concerned the historical narrative of events in 1948, the year in which Israel fought a war to establish itself as an independent state, and hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled the ensuing conflict.\nThe killing of Palestinians is depicted as something that was necessary for the survival of the nascent Jewish state, she claims.\"\nThose who see this as an aberration of Zionism seem to lack sufficient understanding of what Zionism really is and the central role it plays as a patently racist ideology in justifying ethnic cleansing and racist domination over Palestinians.\nOne should not wonder then why, at the height of the Israeli massacre in Gaza 2008-09, a Tel Aviv University poll (reported in the Jerusalem Post, Jan. '09) of Jewish-Israeli opinion showed a shocking 94% support for the assault, despite full knowledge of the enormous suffering this Israeli aggression had inflicted upon the 1.5 million Palestinians incarcerated in the Gaza \"prison camp\" and of the massive destruction of their civilian infrastructure.\nAs in every other colonial system, only sustained and effective pressure from within as well as from without can put an end to this downward spiral of criminality, impunity and unspoken racism.

{"text":"The immune system\nimmune; immunity; disease; bacteria; viruses; white; cells; lymph; germs; mucous; mucus; glands;\nWhat is immunity?\nImmunity (say im-yoon-it-i) means that you are protected against something. There are different kinds of immunity. This topic is about how different parts of our bodies work together to keep us from getting sick. Immunity to some diseases is passed on from our mothers before we are born. Immunisation (having your 'shots') helps our body's immune defence system protect us from diseases .\nbody's immune system\nEvery body has an inbuilt immune system which protects it from diseases and germs. This system has a lot of different parts which work together to keep out any harmful germs, and attack and destroy any which manage to get inside your body\n- Every day your body is exposed to millions of germs, and you do not get sick from them because of your immune system.\n- Every time you do get sick because of a germ, your immune system works to get rid of it and then it remembers how to fight the infection if the same germ comes again.\n- Usually the older you get, the more germs you become immune to.\nSo, let's have a look at the immune system, starting from the outside of the body.\nThe skin is the first line of defence in your immune system.\nYou know how you put plastic wrap over leftovers to keep them fresh enough for later? Well, your skin is like a plastic wrap to keep germs from getting into your body.\n- The epidermis (outside layer of skin) has special cells which warn the body about incoming germs.\n- Glands in the skin also make substances that can kill some bacteria (anti-bacterial chemicals). This means you don't get infections on your skin unless your skin is damaged, such as by a cut or a graze.\nYour nose, mouth and eyes are the next point of attack.\n- The mucous membranes which line the mouth, throat, lungs and bowel, act like a barrier to germs, just as the skin does.\n- Saliva in the mouth and the tears which wash your eyes have special enzymes (chemicals) in them which break down the cell walls of many bacteria and viruses.\n- The mucous that is made in your nose, throat and lungs traps bacteria, viruses and dust.\n- Acid in your stomach kills most germs, and starts to digest your food.\n- Lymph (limf) is a clear fluid that is very similar to blood plasma, the clear liquid in blood, but it carries only white blood cells, not red blood cells.\n- The lymph flows through all the parts of the body picking up fluid around cells and carrying it back to large veins near the heart. It also carries white blood cells to the places that they are needed.\n- Some bacteria or viruses that have entered the body are collected by the lymph and passed on to the lymph nodes where they are filtered out and destroyed. Lymph nodes are sometimes called glands.\nYour doctor can often tell if you have an infection by checking out the lymph nodes (glands) in your neck and under your arms to see if they're swollen. If they are, it shows that they are working to get rid of bacteria or viruses.\nIn your blood you have red blood cells and white blood cells, and in lymph there are white blood cells.\nThere are several different types of white cells which work together to seek out and destroy bacteria and viruses.\nAll of them start off in the bone marrow, growing from 'stem cells'.\nThe disease-fighting white blood cells are specialists. Some of the white blood cells are:\n- Neutrophils (say new-tro-fills), which move around the body in the blood and seek out foreign material (things that don't belong in your body).\n- Macrophages (say mak-row-far-jes) are the biggest blood cells. Some live in different parts of the body and help to keep it clean, eg. in the lungs. Others swim around cleaning up other white blood cells that have been damaged while doing their jobs, eg. cleaning up pus that has been caused by neutrophils when they work to clear out bacteria from a wound.\n- Lymphocytes (say lim-fo-sites) work on bacterial and viral infections\nThere are two different types:\n- B cells produce antibodies. Each cell watches out for a particular germ, and when that germ arrives, the cell starts to produce more antibodies which begin the process of killing that germ. Antibodies attach themselves to the germs so that other cells can recognise that these germs need to be destroyed.\n- T cells look for cells in your body that are hiding invaders (germs) or body cells that are different to normal healthy cells (such as cells that could develop into a cancer) and kill them.\ndoes your immune system know which cells to attack?\nYour body has lots of friendly bacteria around it which help your body work properly - eg. some bacteria inside your bowel help you to digest your food and break it up into the different things that are needed in various parts of the body.\n- These friendly bacteria live on the surfaces of the body, such as on our skin or inside the bowel.\n- They do not try to invade the body, so the immune system does not try to get rid of them.\n- Other germs which cause illness, try to enter the body.\n- Antibodies, which are made by the lymphocytes, attach to the invaders so that the other white blood cells can destroy them. They 'tag' them so they can be easily noticed.\nAs well as attacking germs, your immune system recognises and destroys other cells which do not belong in your body.\n- The cells in your own body are marked with a special system called Human Leukocyte Antigen or HLA (say Hew-man lew-ko-site anti-jen).\n- Your immune system can recognise these markings as 'you'. Any cells which do not have the right markings are 'not you' and are therefore attacked.This happens if, for example, you have a blood transfusion with the wrong types of blood cells. Your body's immune system recognises that these cells do not belong in your body, so it destroys them.\nHow you know your immune system is working\nYou know your immune system is working:\n- if you get better after you are sick\n- if cuts heal without getting infected\n- if you don't catch the same diseases over and over again\n- when you get swollen glands\n- when you get swelling and soreness around a cut.\nYour immune system is in there working to get rid of any infection.\nWhen things go wrong with the immune system\nSometimes the immune system will make a mistake.\n- It may attack your own body as if it were the enemy, eg. insulin dependent diabetes (the type that most often starts in children and young people) is caused by the immune system attacking the cells in the pancreas that make insulin.\n- Allergies are caused by the immune system over-reacting to something that is not really a threat, like when pollen triggers hay fever or asthma.\n- If tissue is transplanted from one person to another - eg. a skin or organ transplant - then the immune system will attack the new part. The immune system has to be suppressed by drugs to allow the transplant to work.\n- When the immune system is damaged, such as when people have a serious illness called AIDS, they get lots of infections and are much more likely to get cancers. Their body cannot recognise the infection or abnormal cells very well and the immune system does not destroy them as well as usual.\nThe immune system is absolutely amazing. It deals with millions of bacteria and viruses every day to keep us healthy.\nKeeping up to date with immunisations can help your body to build immunity to some serious diseases too.\nWe've provided this information to help you to understand important things about staying healthy and happy. However, if you feel sick or unhappy, it is important to tell your mum or dad, a teacher or another grown-up.","id":"<urn:uuid:ce2ffe26-b35c-4206-9d9e-c664fdbda89f>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.cyh.sa.gov.au\/HealthTopics\/HealthTopicDetailsKids.aspx?p=335&np=152&id=2402","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9496020675,"token_count":1713,"score":3.59375,"int_score":4}
{"text":"I like projects. I really liked this project. The pipe insulation roller coaster project is one of the most enjoyable projects I've ever used in class.\nIt was my second year teaching physics. During the unit on energy, the book we were using frequently used roller coasters in their problems. We even had a little \"roller coaster\" to use with photo gates. I thought we could do better.\nMy original idea was to get some flexible Hot Wheels tracks and make some loop-de-loops and hills. Turns out a class set of Hot Wheels track is pretty expensive. On an unrelated yet serendipitous visit to my local big box hardware store, I ran across the perfect (and cheap!) substitute: Pipe Insulation!. For $1.30 or so you can get six feet of pipe insulation- which doubles nicely as a marble track1 when you split the pipe insulation into two equal halves. It's really easy to cut pipe insulation with a sharp pair of scissors. Just be sure you don't buy the \"self-sealing\" pipe insulation, which has glue pre-applied- it's more expensive and it'd turn into a sticky mess.\nAt first I planning to simply design a one-period long investigation using the pipe insulation (my original ideas morphed into the pre-activity for this project). As I started to think through the project more and more, I realized we could go way bigger. And thus, the pipe insulation roller coaster project was born.\nBuilding the Coasters\nIn groups of three, students were given 24 feet of pipe insulation (4 pieces), a roll of duct tape2, and access to a large pile of cardboard boxes3. All groups had to adhere to a few standard requirements:\n- Construction requirements\n- The entire roller coaster must fit within a 1.0m x 2.0m rectangle4.\n- There must be at least two inversions (loops, corkscrews, etc.).\n- All 24 feet of pipe insulation must be used.\n- The track must end 50 cm above the ground.\nIn addition to meeting the above requirements, students were required to utilize their understanding of the work-energy theorem, circular motion, and friction to do the following:\n- Determine the average rolling friction, kinetic energy, and potential energy at 8 locations on their roller coaster.\n- Determine the minimum velocities required for the marble to stay on the track at the top of all the inversions\n- Determine the g-forces the marble experiences through the inversions and at least five additional corners, hills, or valleys.\n- The g-forces must be kept at \"safe\" levels5.\n- Rolling friction, kinetic energy, and potential energy\n- The potential energy () is easy enough to find after measuring the height of the track and finding the mass of the marble. The kinetic energy is trickier and can be done by filming the marble and doing some analysis with Tracker, but since the speed of the marble is likely to be a little too fast for most cameras to pick up clearly, it's probably easier (and much faster) to simply measure the time it takes the marble travel a certain length of track. I describe how this can be done in a previous post, so check that out for more info. That post also includes how to calculated the coefficient of friction by finding how much work was done on the marble due to friction- so I'll keep things shorter here by not re-explaining that process.\n- Pro-tip: Have students mark every 10 cm or so on their track before they start putting together their coasters (note the tape marks in this pic). Since d in in this case is the length of track the marble has rolled so far, it makes finding the value for d much easier than trying to measure a twisting, looping roller coaster track.\n- This is also called the critical velocity. That's fitting. If you're riding a roller coaster it's pretty critical that you make it around each loop. Also, you might be in critical condition if you don't. While falling to our death would be exciting, it also limits the ability to ride roller coasters in the future (and I like roller coasters). Since we're primarily concerned with what is happening to the marble at the top of the loop, here's a diagram of the vertical forces on the marble at the very top of the loop:\nSo just normal force (the track pushing on the marble) and gravitational force (the earth pulling on the marble). Since these forces are both acting towards the center of the loop together they're equal to the radial force:\nWhen the marble is just barely making it around the loop (at the critical velocity), the normal force goes to zero. That is, the track stops pushing on the marble for just an instant at the top of the loop. If the normal force stays zero for any longer than that it means the marble is in free fall, and that's just not safe. So:\nThen when you substitute in masses and accelerations for the forces and do some rearranging:\nThere you go. All you need to know is the radius of the loop, and that's easy enough to measure. Of course, you'd want a little cushion above the critical velocity, especially because we're ignoring the friction that is constantly slowing down the marble as it makes its way down the track.\n- An exciting roller coaster will make you weightless and in the next instant squish you into your seat. A really bad roller coaster squishes you until you pass out. This is awesomely known as G-LOC (G-force Induced Loss of Consciousness). With the proper training and gear, fighter pilots can make it to about 9g's before G-LOC. Mere mortals like myself usually experience G-LOC between 4 and 6g's.\nAs I mentioned, I set the limit for pipe insulation roller coasters at 30g's simply because it allowed more creative and exciting coaster designs. While this would kill most humans, it turns out marbles have a very high tolerance before reaching G-LOC.\nRaise the stakes\nStudents become fiercely proud of their roller coasters. They'll name them. Brag about them. Drag their friends in during lunch to show them off. Seeing this, I had students show off their creations to any teachers, parents, or administrators that I was able to cajole into stopping by for the official testing of the coasters. I even made up a fun little rubric (.doc file) for any observers to fill out for each coaster. This introduces some level of competition into the project, which gives me pause- though from day one students generally start some friendly smack talk about how their coaster is akin to the Millenium Force while all other coasters are more like the Woodstock Express. The students love to show off their coasters, and it seems the people being shown enjoy the experience as well.\nAssessment is massively important. However, this post is already long. The exciting conclusion of this post will feature the assessment piece in: Part 2: Pipe Insulation Roller Coaster Assessment.\nThe Pipe Insulation Roller Coaster Series\n- Pipe Insulation Roller Coasters and Rolling Friction\n- Pipe Insulation Roller Coasters\n- Pipe Insulation Roller Coaster Assessment\n- The first day we played with pipe insulation in class I had students use some marble-sized steel balls. Unfortunately because the steel balls are so much heavier and the pipe insulation is spongy and flexible, there was just too much friction. When we switched to marbles the next day everything worked like a charm. (back)\n- Most groups typically use more than one roll of duct tape. My first couple years I bought the colored duct tape and gave each group a different color. That was a nice touch, but also a bit more expensive than using the standard silver. Whatever you decide, I highly recommend avoiding the cut-rate duct tape. The cheap stuff just didn't stick as well which caused students to waste a lot of time fixing places where the duct tape fell and in the end used a lot more duct tape. (back)\n- I had an arrangement with our school's kitchen manager to set broken down boxes aside for me for a few weeks before we started the project. If that's not an option, I've also found if you talk to a manager of a local grocery store they're usually more than willing to donate boxes. (back)\n- I made it a requirement for groups to start by building a cardboard rectangle with the maximum dimensions.

{"text":"- Date: January 25, 2011\n- In This Story:\nAsian tiger reserves can support more than 10,000 wild tigers\u2014three times the current estimate\u2014if they are managed as large-scale landscapes that protect core breeding sites and benefit local communities, according to the world\u2019s leading conservation scientists in a new study published on January 25. This positive news reveals that doubling the number of tigers in the wild is feasible.\n\u201cIn the midst of a crisis, it\u2019s tempting to circle the wagons and only protect a limited number of core protected areas, but we can and should do better,\u201d said Dr. Eric Dinerstein, Chief Scientist at WWF and co-author of the study. \u201cWe absolutely need to stop the bleeding, the poaching of tigers and their prey in core breeding areas, but we need to go much further and secure larger tiger landscapes before it is too late.\u201d\nWild tiger numbers have declined to as few as 3,200 today compared to 100,000 a century ago, due to poaching of tigers and their prey, habitat destruction and human-tiger conflict. \u201cA Landscape-Based Conservation Strategy to Double the Wild Tiger Population\u201d in the current issue of Conservation Letters provides the first assessment of the political commitment made by all 13 tiger range countries at November\u2019s historic tiger summit to double the tiger population across Asia by 2022. The study found that the 20 priority tiger conservation landscapes with the highest probability of long-term tiger survival could support more than 10,500 tigers, including about 3,400 breeding females.\n\u201cTiger conservation is the face of biodiversity conservation and competent sustainable land-use management at the landscape level,\u201d said study co-author Dr. John Seidensticker of the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute. \u201cBy saving the tiger we save all the plants and animals that live under the tiger\u2019s umbrella.\u201d\nThe study also revealed that major infrastructure projects such dams, roads and mines will threaten tiger landscapes in the next decade. However, channeling revenues to communities from wildlife tourism, forest management in corridors and buffer zones, and earning carbon credits will provide new opportunities.\nRead the full study\nView a map of the 12 best places to double the number of tigers in the wild\nLearn more about wild tigers\n\u201cWithout strong countervailing pressures, short-term economic gains will inevitably trump protection of the critical ecosystems necessary for sustainable development,\u201d said Keshav Varma, Program Director of the Global Tiger Initiative at the World Bank.\nThe study calls for mainstreaming wildlife conservation to shift to well-funded efforts to protect core areas and larger landscapes, a challenging task that will require innovation through arrangements that benefit the rural communities living in these landscapes. Countries like Nepal are already looking closely at building alliances and partnerships for better landscape management that benefits both people and tigers.\n\"Following the St. Petersburg Declaration, Nepal has committed to the goal of doubling wild tiger numbers across our country by 2022,\u201d said Deepak Bohara, Nepal\u2019s Minister for Forests and Soil Conservation. \u201cThis analysis shows that it can be done, not just in Nepal, but, if done right with careful study and planning, across the entire tiger range. It is also worth noting that the tiger conservation provides carbon credits, protects water resources, and complements community development efforts. Thus, it is important to promote regional cooperation to maintain a healthy tiger corridor between different reserves.\u201d","id":"<urn:uuid:0f63be90-a486-431d-b2d2-80abce277e86>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/worldwildlife.org\/stories\/a-future-for-tigers","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.927092135,"token_count":716,"score":3.28125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"HPV virus is linked to 25,000 cancers over five years. The human wart virus known as HPV caused 25,000 cases of cancer in the United States between 1998 and 2003, including not only cervical cancer but also anal and mouth cancers, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Monday. The study suggests the need for screening of both men and women to be expanded for human papillomavirus, or HPV, said another team of researchers, who did a similar study. HPV includes about 100 different viruses, and they are the leading cause of cervical cancer. The viruses, transmitted sexually and by skin-to-skin contact, can also cause anal and penile cancers, as well as cancers of the mouth and throat. HPV also causes common warts. Both Merck and Co. and GlaxoSmithKline make vaccines against some of the strains of HPV most strongly linked with cervical cancer, but not all. The vaccines are recommended for girls and young women who have not yet become sexual activity. \u201dCurrently available HPV vaccines have the potential to reduce the rates of HPV-associated cancers, like oral and anal cancers, that are currently on the rise and for which there is no effective or widely applied screening programs,\u201d the CDC\u2019s Dr. Mona Saraiya, who led the study, said in a statement. \u201cThis gives us baseline data to measure the impact of HPV vaccine and cervical cancer screening programs in reducing the incidence of cervical cancer and other HPV-associated cancers\u2026 .\u201d\nSleep is seen as the newest obesity fighter. Consistently getting a good night\u2019s sleep may help protect children from becoming overweight adults, a study published Monday suggests. Researchers found that among more than 1,000 people followed from birth to age 32, those who got too little sleep as children were more likely than their well-rested counterparts to become obese adults, Reuters News reports. The link between sleep deprivation during childhood and obesity risk later in life held up even when the researchers figured in things like the impact of a child\u2019s weight or TV habits, and adulthood exercise level. All of this supports the idea that early sleep habits have a direct effect on weight in the long term, according to Dr. Robert John Hancox, the study\u2019s senior author. \u201cAlthough we cannot prove that this is a cause-and-effect relationship,\u201d he told Reuters Health, \u201cthis study provides strong evidence that it probably is.\u201d\nEating more fish can help you control diabetes. Centering your dinner around a fish dish at least twice a week might help people with diabetes lower their risk of kidney disease, a study suggests. In the November issue of the American Journal of Kidney Diseases, British researchers analyzed the records of more than 22,300 middle-aged and older English men and women who were part of a large European cancer study to determine the effect of fish on kidney disease. What they found is that of the 517 study subjects who had diabetes (most of whom had type 2), those who on average ate less than one serving of fish each week were four times as likely to have albumin in their urine than people with diabetes who ate fish twice a week. Adler speculates that the nutrient content of fish may affect kidney function and improve blood glucose control. But the researchers could not say what type of fish had the biggest impact, reports USA Today.To get more help with diabetes, go to BET.com\/Body &Soul.","id":"<urn:uuid:afc85103-c0df-4e66-87b4-0cda4290f91d>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/blogs.bet.com\/news\/news-you-should-know\/tag\/diabetes\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9741098285,"token_count":717,"score":3.03125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Children of substance abusers: Observations and their mothers' reports of childrearing practices\nThe widespread use of drugs includes women who are mothers and of childbearing age. A review of the literature shows that women who are substance abusers suffer from depression, low self-esteem, have poor health and nutrition, and histories of family violence and abuse.^ During pregnancy, addictive women often lack prenatal care. In utero exposure to drugs is associated with multiple postnatal outcomes which include prematurity, low birth weight, neonatal abstinence syndrome, and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Intelligence testing found that the children scored within the normal range but significantly lower than the children of drug-free controls.^ Conflicting views on the parenting of mothers who are substance abusers exist. Deprived and poorly nurtured in childhood themselves, they feel inadequate as parents. However, they love their children, are capable of learning developmental issues of childhood, and can respond with sensitivity to their needs.^ The purpose of this study was to examine the child-rearing attitudes and parental style of addicted mothers and the impact of their drug use, parental attitudes, and demographic variables on their interactions with their children. Forty-four mothers, forty-one drug users and three non-drug users, and nineteen infants participated in the study. Participants attended the Infant and Toddler Schools of the Center for Comprehensive Health Practice, Inc. Subjects completed the demographic sheet and the modified Child-Rearing Practices Report (CRPR). The child data was obtained from the agency and included the scores of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, the Checklist for Caregiver-Infant Observation, and the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment-Short Form (Home-SF). Generally, greater parental control and less expression of affection were adhered to as values by the participants of the study. Correlations as a function of drug usage and demographic variables suggested that the participants held both sound and inappropriate child-rearing attitudes. Length of treatment and the age of the youngest child emerged as the demographic variables most related to the parental attitude variables. The children scored within the average range of intelligence, however, the range of variation was highly significant. ^\nHealth Sciences, Mental Health|Women's Studies|Psychology, Developmental\nSarai Ramona Padilla-Rafalsky,\n\"Children of substance abusers: Observations and their mothers' reports of childrearing practices\"\n(January 1, 1993).\nETD Collection for Pace University.","id":"<urn:uuid:288bae5d-f267-40ac-bd2c-195909577617>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/digitalcommons.pace.edu\/dissertations\/AAI9406436\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9386689067,"token_count":516,"score":2.546875,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Introduction \/ History\nJews represent the oldest monotheistic religion of modern times. Because of the uniqueness of their history and culture, all Jews have a strong sense of identity. Persecution of and discrimination against the Jews have been the historical reasons for their migrations and settlements around the world.\nThe Jews of Europe arrived on the continent at least 2,000 years ago during the early days of the Roman empire. Since then, they have been a significant influence in the history and culture of Europe. Much of what is considered \"Jewish\" today finds its roots among the European Jews.\nOne of the unique features among European Jews is the distinction between the Ashkenazic Jews and the Sephardic Jews. The word Ashkenaz is derived from a Biblical word for the larger Germanic region of Europe. Therefore, Ashkenazim Jews are those whose ancestry is linked to that area. This group traditionally speaks the Yiddish language, which is a German dialect that has Hebrew and Slavic elements. The word Sephard was the name used by Jews in medieval times for the Iberian peninsula. Sephardim Jews, then, are the descendants of the Jews who lived in Spain or Portugal prior to expulsion in 1492 by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella. Sephardim also have a distinctive language called Ladino, or Judeo-Spanish. This is a dialect of Castilian Spanish with Hebrew and Turkish elements.\nWhat are their lives like?\nDuring the last few centuries, Eastern Europe had the largest Jewish population in the world. National attitudes toward the Jews were ambivalent, depending on the usefulness of the Jewish inhabitants to the nations' rulers. Anti-Semitism was prevalent and frequently led to either persecution or expulsion. The Holocaust of World War II was the climax of Jewish persecution in Europe, leading to the extermination of six million Jews. Many Eastern European countries lost the majority of their Jewish population in this tragedy.\nAs a result of the Holocaust, thousands of Jewish survivors and their descendants have emigrated from Eastern Europe to Israel, the United States, or Western Europe. The recent memories of the Holocaust as well as the centuries of discrimination and persecution play a strong part in modern Jewish identity. European Jews are strong supporters of \"Zionism,\" a revival of Jewish culture and support of Israel as a national, secure, Jewish homeland.\nSince the dissolution of the Soviet empire, former Soviet Jews no longer live under oppressive government rule. Anti-Semitism is still a concern, but Jewish life has been revitalized in recreated countries like the Ukraine. Synagogues are functioning and kosher (traditional, acceptable) food is once again available.\nThe Jewish emigration from Eastern Europe is cause for concern among the remaining aged Jewish population. As the older Jews die, the Jewish community dwindles. Many of the younger Jews are unlearned in their Jewish identity. They are either non-observant or have assimilated into the prevailing culture. However, strong efforts are being made to maintain a Jewish presence and clarify their identity. Jewish schools are being opened and Judaic studies are being promoted in universities. Jewish hospitals and retirement homes are being built. Community centers also promote cultural events such as the Israeli dance, theater, Yiddish and Hebrew lessons, and sports.\nWestern Europe now has the largest concentration of European Jewish residents. The Netherlands received a large influx of Sephardic Jews from Portugal in the late 1500's, and another contingent of Ashkenazic Jews after World War II. They have been very influential in the development of Dutch commerce. England's Jews are concentrated in the Greater London area and have been politically active for over 100 years. They have been avid supporters of Zionism and solidly committed to the settlement of Diaspora Jews in Israel. A large percentage of England's Jews are affiliated with the traditional Orthodox synagogues. Italy's Jewish population is primarily Sephardic due to its absorption of Spanish Jews in the 1500's. France's Ashkenazic community received 300,000 Sephardic Jews from North Africa in recent decades.\nWhat are their beliefs?\nFor religious Jews, God is the Supreme Being, the Creator of the universe, and the ultimate Judge of human affairs. Beyond this, the religious beliefs of the Jewish communities vary greatly. European Jews are extremely diverse in religious practice. The Ashkenazic Jews are the most prevalent, representing the Orthodox, ultra-Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform movements. The unusual and adamantly traditional Hasidic movement was born in Poland and has gained a strong following in the United States and Israel. The Sephardic denomination is similar to the Orthodox Ashkenazic, but is more permissive on dietary rules and some religious practices. Each Jewish denomination maintains synagogues and celebrates the traditional Jewish holiday calendar. While most European Jews are religiously affiliated, there is a significant minority which is not religious.\nWhat are their needs?\nThe Jews have a wonderful understanding of their connection with the Abrahamic covenant. However, they also have a history of rejecting Jesus Christ as Messiah, the one who has fulfilled that covenant. Pray that as the Gospel is shared, it will not be viewed as anti-Semitic, but rather as the fulfillment of what God promised through Abraham centuries ago.\nPrayer PointsView Jew, Eastern Yiddish-Speaking in all countries.\n* Ask the Lord of the harvest to send forth loving Christians to work among the Jewish communities.\n* Ask the Holy Spirit to grant wisdom and favor to the missions agencies that are focusing on the European Jews.\n* Pray that the Jewish people will understand that Jesus is the long-awaited Messiah.\n* Ask the Lord to soften the hearts of the Jews towards Christians so that they might hear and receive the message of salvation.\n* Pray that the Lord Jesus will reveal Himself to the Jews through dreams and visions.\n* Pray that God will grant Jewish believers favor as they share their faith in Christ with their own people.\n* Pray that strong local churches will be raised up in each Jewish community.\n* Pray for the availability of the Jesus Film in the primary language of this people.","id":"<urn:uuid:58c97692-7ec3-45e2-add2-5f67fd45724c>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/joshuaproject.net\/people-profile.php?peo3=12350&rog3=BO","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9605475068,"token_count":1249,"score":4.125,"int_score":4}
