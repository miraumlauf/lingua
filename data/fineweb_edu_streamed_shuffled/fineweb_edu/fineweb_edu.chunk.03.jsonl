{"text":"Talk:20.109(F12) Pre-Proposal: Engineering Viral Magnetic Nanoparticles for Magnetic Hyperthermic Cancer Therapy\n- This is a brainstorming page.\nYou are very welcome to write any crazy \/ non-crazy \/ inventive \/ conventional \/ knowledgeable ideas or information you may have about our project.\nSome key words: Magnetic Nanoparticles (MNP), Viruses, Magnetic Hyperthermia, Bioengineering\nWhat is Magnetic Hyperthermia?\nHow it works?\nUnder an alternating magnetic field, MNP releases heat due to relaxation of magnetic moments (hysteresis). This can cause an increase in temperature to the range of 41C to 47C. Since tumor cells are more heat sensitive than normal cells, they will be killed by this thermal dissipation.\nHere is an interesting tidbit from a paper I was reading: \"In addition to the expected tumor cell death, hyperthermia treatment has also induced unexpected biological responses, such as tumor-specific immune responses as a result of heat-shock protein expression. These results suggest that hyperthermia is able to kill not only local tumors exposed to heat treatment, but also tumors at distant sites, including metastatic cancer cells.\" (Kobayashi)\n- Clinical trials in prostate cancer\n- Shows promising results when coupled with irradiation on breast cancer (mouse)\nCurrent Limitations (This information will help us shape and define the problem.)\n(1) To achieve the necessary rise in temperature with minimal dose of MNP.\n- In other words, this means:\n- High specific loss power \/ specific absorption rate (SLP) of the MNP.\n- why is higher applied dosage bad? > leads to unnecessary heat dissipation\n(2) Lack of knowledge about the metabolism, clearance, and toxicity of MNP.\nBiomedical potentials of MNP\n- Could be used as early detection for the following using MRI:\n- Drug Delivery\n- Cellular labeling and tissue targeting\n- Purifying and separating cells and DNAs\n- Transfection by magnetic nanoparticles\n- Tissue repair\n- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nTypes of Relevant Viruses\n1. Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV)\n- 18nmx300nm, helical\n- Can withstand high temperatures up to 50C for 30mins (conventional hyperthermia involves heating up to 50C from an external source\n- Safe for human consumption\n- Mann group has active research on it\n- 2130 molecules of coat protein\n2. M13 Bacteriophage\n- 6.6nmx880nm, helical (Length is too long - pose an issue in targeting cells)\n- Lots of research done by the Belcher group, including attaching MNPs to M13 for imaging purposes\n- We are familiar with the system\n3. Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV)\n- 26nm, icosahedral\n4. Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV)\n- 27nm, icosahedral\n5. Brome mosaic virus (BMV)\n- 28nm, icosahedral\n6. Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV)\n- 30nm, icosahedral\nCurrent Work in Viral MNP Attachment\nAttachment of MNPs to M13 phage for in vivo imaging of prostate cancer\nWhat we propose to do\nSee flowchart sketch.\n- Identifying \/ Screening for appropriate virus vehicles and tumor-specific anchoring sequencse\n- Developing \/ Engineering viral MNPs\n- in vivo testing for efficacy of engineered vMNPs in mouse tumor cells.\nWe will start with using ferritin (Fe3O4) as the MNP.\nStage 1: Virus Hunt\n- We need to investigate how the selected virus (likely one of the following: TMV, M13, CCMV, CPMV, BMV or TPMV) interacts with mammalian cells in vivo.\nStage 2: Screening for MNP binding site on virus\n- We will start by using Fe3O4 as our MNP of interest. With this, a protein coat screen of the selected virus for a protein coat that can bind with our MNP is necessary.\nStage 3: Screening for tumor-specific sequence binding site on virus\n- We need to do a protein coat or RNA screen of the virus for a region that can bind with a tumor-specific peptide sequence. If necessary, we might need to screen tumors for unique short sequences on their cell surfaces.\nStage 4: Virus engineering\n- We can now engineer wild-type viruses using specific protein coats or RNA regions isolated in Stage 2 and 3 to produce the viral MNP of interest.\nStage 5: in vivo testing\n- Perform an in vivo experiment by injecting the engineered viral MNPs into the circulatory system of mice that have developed tumors. By subjecting these mice to an alternating magnetic field under standard hyperthermia conditions and measuring the change in tumor size, we will be able to quantify the efficacy of using viral MNPs in magnetic hyperthermia.\n- Experimenting with double layer MNP to increase response\n- Target other cancerous cells\n- Experiment with other types of viruses\nQuantitative Goals (We can quantify with IC50 value)\n- Currently, with the aid of 10Gy radiation, the hyperthermia treatment successfully accumulated less than 0.3mg Fe\/g tissue. Dosage: 0.2mg Fe per gram of mouse. Say mouse is 25g, so 5mg total dosage injected. so 1% efficiency with the aid of radiation. (MNP sizes used: 70nm and 120nm; murine flank breast tumors were 150mm3)\nFrom http:\/\/manalis-lab.mit.edu\/publications\/grover%20PNAS%202011.pdf, we estimated that a typical cell has an average density of 1.1g\/mL. Since the murine flank breast tumors were 150mm3, and 0.25mg Fe\/g of tumor was detected in the tumors, we can calculate that only a total of 0.0495mg of Fe is accumulated in the tumors. This gives a % efficacy of 1%.\n- South Korean experiment: 75ug of MNPs were injected.\n- From Belcher lab's paper, what is the % efficacy of using M13?\n- \"The actual rotations of the nanoparticles are disordered because the microviscosity of the local environment in cancer cells is not constant, and effective elasticity depends on the binding conditions between nanoparticles and membranes.\"\n- but this is actually present because when treatment is done with individual MNPs, one side of the MNP is always bound to the targeted cell, so direction is never constant!\n- Gupta AK, Naregalkar RR, Vaidya VD, and Gupta M.

{"text":"Previous |Next |Title\nAlthough the process of forming national constitutions in European states began more than two centuries ago, the actual texts of EU member state constitutions all date from the present century, with the single, obvious exception of the British constitution. The venerable British texts merit an obligatory nod of tribute to that paradoxical cradle of the constitutional state. A few European constitutional texts are the cumulative result of successive reforms of texts originally drafted in the nineteenth century or earlier, and are found in those societies that managed to avoid the dramatic upheavals which punctuate the histories of other European states. The majority of the constitutions were promulgated after the Second World War, following governmental ruptures of varying intensity and duration. A final group of texts have their origin in the inter-war period and were drafted concurrent to the creation, or re-creation, of their corresponding states.\nThe \"reformed\" texts often contain some structural traces of their origins in the preservation of the monarchy, or in the use of traditional formulae. However, the depth of the changes that were carried out makes it virtually impossible to establish clear distinctions, based upon constitutional content, between these and the newer texts. Even those differences arising from the opposition of monarchy and republic are difficult to delineate clearly, in part due to the anomaly presented by Spain. The Spanish constitution is a new constitution, but it is also monarchical. In addition, the opposition in Spain to the constitutional order is no longer of political importance. The King of Spain is reputed to have stated long before his coronation that \"my aspiration is to be king of a Spanish Republic\" - a sentiment that acknowledged the reality that European monarchies are nothing more than republics with crowns.\n This set of cases includes Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Sweden.\n The Swedish Instrument of Government, the oldest written constitution in Europe, dates from 1720.\n Prolonged and serious ruptures occurred in Germany, Spain, Greece, Italy, and Portugal. In France the rupture brought about by the Vichy regime was shorter and concluded with the Constitution of 1946. A new and clear break occurred in 1958 when political circumstances surrounding the army revolt in Algeria led to the replacement of the 1946 Constitution.\n Included here are the cases of Austria, Finland, and Ireland. These constitutions have a number of distinctive characteristics which are not considered here.\n In the case of Belgium, the extent of the constitutional reform affected the very contour of the state.\nPrevious |Next |Title\nTop of the page","id":"<urn:uuid:3c9ab2d9-ca35-44a8-82dd-530e32a4bc57>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/centers.law.nyu.edu\/jeanmonnet\/archive\/papers\/98\/985002.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9588373303,"token_count":518,"score":3.578125,"int_score":4}

In the meantime, you've started looking at two phase equilibrium. So now we're starting to look at mixtures. And so now we have more than one constituent. And we have more than one phase present. Right? So you've started to look at things that look like this, where you've got, let's say, two components. Both in the gas phase. And now to try to figure out what the phase equilibria look like. Of course it's now a little bit more complicated than what you went through before, where you can get pressure temperature phase diagrams with just a single component. Now we want to worry about what's the composition. Of each of the components. In each of the phases. And what's the temperature and the pressure. Total and partial pressures and all of that. So you can really figure out everything about both phases. And there are all sorts of important reasons to do that, obviously lots of chemistry happens in liquid mixtures. Some in gas mixtures. Some where they're in equilibrium. All sorts of chemical processes. Distillation, for example, takes advantage of the properties of liquid and gas mixtures. Where one of them might be richer, will be richer, and the more volatile of the components. That can be used as a basis for purification. You mix ethanol and water together so you've got a liquid with a certain composition of each. The gas is going to be richer and the more volatile of the two, the ethanol. So in a distillation, where you put things up in the gas, more of the ethanol comes up. You could then collect that gas, right? And re-condense it, and make a new liquid. Which is much richer in ethanol than the original liquid was. Then you could make, then you could put some of them up into the gas phase. Where it will be still richer in ethanol. And then you could collect that and repeat the process. So the point is that properties of liquid gas, two-component or multi-component mixtures like this can be exploited. Basically, the different volatilities of the different components can be exploited for things like purification.\nAlso if you want to calculate chemical equilibria in the liquid and gas phase, of course, now you've seen chemical equilibrium, so the amount of reaction depends on the composition. So of course if you want reactions to go, then this also can be exploited by looking at which phase might be richer in one reactant or another. And thereby pushing the equilibrium toward one direction or the other. OK. So. we've got some total temperature and pressure. And we have compositions. So in the gas phase, we've got mole fractions yA and yB. In the liquid phase we've got mole fractions xA and xB. So that's our system. One of the things that you established last time is that, so there are the total number of variables including the temperature and the pressure. And let's say the mole fraction of A in each of the liquid and gas phases, right? But then there are constraints. Because the chemical potentials have to be equal, right? Chemical potential of A has to be equal in the liquid and gas. Same with B. Those two constraints reduce the number of independent variables. So there'll be two in this case rather than four independent variables. If you control those, then everything else will follow. What that means is if you've got a, if you control, if you fix the temperature and the total pressure, everything else should be determinable. No more free variables.\nAnd then, what you saw is that in simple or ideal liquid mixtures, a result called Raoult's law would hold. Which just says that the partial pressure of A is equal to the mole fraction of A in the liquid times the pressure of pure A over the liquid. And so what this gives you is a diagram that looks like this. If we plot this versus xB, this is mole fraction of B in the liquid going from zero to one. Then we could construct a diagram of this sort. So this is the total pressure of A and B. The partial pressures are given by these lines. So this is our pA star and pB star. The pressures over the pure liquid A and B at the limits of mole fraction of B being zero and one. So in this situation, for example, A is the more volatile of the components. So it's partial pressure over its pure liquid. At this temperature. Is higher than the partial pressure of B over its pure liquid. A would be the ethanol, for example and B the water in that mixture. OK. Then you started looking at both the gas and the liquid phase in the same diagram. So this is the mole fraction of the liquid. If you look and see, well, OK now we should be able to determine the mole fraction in the gas as well. Again, if we note total temperature and pressure, everything else must follow.\nAnd so, you saw this worked out. Relation between p and yA, for example. The result was p is pA star times pB star over pA star plus pB star minus pA star times yA. And the point here is that unlike this case, where you have a linear relationship, the relationship between the pressure and the liquid mole fraction isn't linear. We can still plot it, of course. So if we do that, then we end up with a diagram that looks like the following. Now I'm going to keep both mole fractions, xB and yB, I've got some total pressure. I still have my linear relationship. And then I have a non-linear relationship between the pressure and the mole fraction in the gas phase. So let's just fill this in. Here is pA star still. Here's pB star. Of course, at the limits they're still, both mole fractions they're zero and one.\nOK. I believe this is this is where you ended up at the end of the last lecture. But it's probably not so clear exactly how you read something like this. And use it. It's extremely useful. You just have to kind of learn how to follow what happens in a diagram like this. And that's what I want to spend some of today doing. Is just, walking through what's happening physically, with a container with a mixture of the two. And how does that correspond to what gets read off the diagram under different conditions. So. Let's just start somewhere on a phase diagram like this.\nLet's start up here at some point one, so we're in the pure - well, not pure, you're in the all liquid phase. It's still a mixture. It's not a pure substance. pA star, pB star. There's the gas phase. So, if we start at one, and now there's some total pressure. And now we're going to reduce it. What happens? We start with a pure - with an all-liquid mixture. No gas. And now we're going to bring down the pressure. Allowing some of the liquid to go up into the gas phase. So, we can do that. And once we reach point two, then we find a coexistence curve. Now the liquid and gas are going to coexist. So this is the liquid phase. And that means that this must be xB. And it's xB at one, but it's also xB at two, and I want to emphasize that. So let's put our pressure for two. And if we go over here, this is telling us about the mole fraction in the gas phase. That's what these curves are, remember. So this is the one that's showing us the mole fraction in the liquid phase. This nonlinear one in the gas phase. So that means just reading off it, this is xB, that's the liquid mole fraction. Here's yB. The gas mole fraction. They're not the same, right, because of course the components have different volatility. A's more volatile.\nSo that means that the mole fraction of B in the liquid phase is higher than the mole fraction of B in the gas phase. Because A is the more volatile component. So more, relatively more, of A, the mole fraction of A is going to be higher up in the gas phase. Which means the mole fraction of B is lower in the gas phase. So, yB less than xB if A is more volatile. OK, so now what's happening physically? Well, we started at a point where we only had the liquid present. So at our initial pressure, we just have all liquid. There's some xB at one. That's all there is, there isn't any gas yet. Now, what happened here? Well, now we lowered the pressure. So you could imagine, well, we made the box bigger. Now, if the liquid was under pressure, being squeezed by the box, right then you could make the box a little bit bigger. And there's still no gas. That's moving down like this. But then you get to a point where there's just barely any pressure on top of the liquid. And then you keep expanding the box. Now some gas is going to form.\nSo now we're going to go to our case two. We've got a bigger box. And now, right around where this was, this is going to be liquid. And there's gas up here. So up here is yB at pressure two. Here's xB at pressure two. Liquid and gas. So that's where we are at point two here.\nNow, what happens if we keep going? Let's lower the pressure some more. Well, we can lower it and do this. But really if we want to see what's happening in each of the phases, we have to stay on the coexistence curves. Those are what tell us what the pressures are. What the partial pressure are going to be in each of the phases. In each of the two, in the liquid and the gas phases. So let's say we lower the pressure a little more. What's going to happen is, then we'll end up somewhere over here. In the liquid, and that'll correspond to something over here in the gas. So here's three.\nSo now we're going to have, that's going to be xB at pressure three. And over here is going to be yB at pressure three. And all we've done, of course, is we've just expanded this further. So now we've got a still taller box. And the liquid is going to be a little lower because some of it has evaporated, formed the gas phase. So here's xB at three. Here's yB at three, here's our gas phase. Now we could decrease even further. And this is the sort of thing that you maybe can't do in real life. But I can do on a blackboard. I'm going to give myself more room on this curve, to finish this illustration. There. Beautiful. So now we can lower a little bit further, and what I want to illustrate is, if we keep going down, eventually we get to a pressure where now if we look over in the gas phase, we're at the same pressure, mole fraction that we had originally in the liquid phase. So let's make four even lower pressure. What does that mean? What it means is, we're running out of liquid. So what's supposed to happen is A is the more volatile component. So as we start opening up some room for gas to form, you get more of A in the gas phase. But of course, and the liquid is richer in B. But of course, eventually you run out of liquid. You make the box pretty big, and you run out, or you have the very last drop of liquid. So what's the mole fraction of B in the gas phase? It has to be the same as what it started in in the liquid phase. Because after all the total number of moles of A and B hasn't changed any. So if you take them all from the liquid and put them all up into the gas phase, it must be the same. So yB of four. Once you just have the last drop. So then yB of four is basically equal to xB of one. Because everything's now up in the gas phase. So in principle, there's still a tiny, tiny bit of xB at pressure four.\nWell, we could keep lowering the pressure. We could make the box a little bigger. Then the very last of the liquid is going to be gone. And what'll happen then is, we're all here. There's no more liquid. We're not going down on the coexistence curve any more. We don't have a liquid gas coexistence any more. We just have a gas phase. Of course, we can continue to lower the pressure. And then what we're doing is just going down here. So there's five. And five is the same as this only bigger. And so forth.\nOK, any questions about how this works? It's really important to just gain facility in reading these things and seeing, OK, what is it that this is telling you. And you can see it's not complicated to do it, but it takes a little bit of practice. OK.\nNow, of course, we could do exactly the same thing starting from the gas phase. And raising the pressure. And although you may anticipate that it's kind of pedantic, I really do want to illustrate something by it. So let me just imagine that we're going to do that. Let's start all in the gas phase. Up here's the liquid. pA star, pB star. And now let's start somewhere here. So we're down somewhere in the gas phase with some composition. So it's the same story, except now we're starting here. It's all gas. And we're going to start squeezing. We're increasing the pressure. And eventually here's one, will reach two, so of course here's our yB. We started with all gas, no liquid. So this is yB of one. It's the same as yB of two, I'm just raising the pressure enough to just reach the coexistence curve. And of course, out here tells us xB of two, right? So what is it saying? We've squeezed and started to form some liquid. And the liquid is richer in component B. Maybe it's ethanol water again. And we squeeze, and now we've got more water in the liquid phase than in the gas phase. Because water's the less volatile component. It's what's going to condense first.\nSo the liquid is rich in the less volatile of the components. Now, obviously, we can continue in doing exactly the reverse of what I showed you. But all I want to really illustrate is, this is a strategy for purification of the less volatile component. Once you've done this, well now you've got some liquid. Now you could collect that liquid in a separate vessel.\nSo let's collect the liquid mixture with xB of two. So it's got some mole fraction of B. So we've purified that. But now we're going to start, we've got pure liquid. Now let's make the vessel big. So it all goes into the gas phase. Then lower p. All gas. So we start with yB of three, which equals xB of two. In other words, it's the same mole fraction. So let's reconstruct that. So here's p of two. And now we're going to go to some new pressure. And the point is, now we're going to start, since the mole fraction in the gas phase that we're starting from is the same number as this was. So it's around here somewhere. That's yB of three equals xB of two. And we're down here. In other words, all we've done is make the container big enough so the pressure's low and it's all in the gas phase. That's all we have, is the gas. But the composition is whatever the composition is that we extracted here from the liquid. So this xB, which is the liquid mole fraction, is now yB, the gas mole fraction. Of course, the pressure is different. Lower than it was before.\nGreat. Now let's increase. So here's three. And now let's increase the pressure to four. And of course what happens, now we've got coexistence. So here's liquid. Here's gas. So, now we're over here again. There's xB at pressure four. Pure still in component B. We can repeat the same procedure. Collect it. All liquid, put it in a new vessel. Expand it, lower the pressure, all goes back into the gas phase. Do it all again. And the point is, what you're doing is walking along here. Here to here. Then you start down here, and go from here to here. From here to here. And you can purify. Now, of course, the optimal procedure, you have to think a little bit. Because if you really do precisely what I said, you're going to have a mighty little bit of material each time you do that. So yes it'll be the little bit you've gotten at the end is going to be really pure, but there's not a whole lot of it. Because, remember, what we said is let's raise the pressure until we just start being on the coexistence curve. So we've still got mostly gas. Little bit of liquid. Now, I could raise the pressure a bit higher. So that in the interest of having more of the liquid, when I do that, though, the liquid that I have at this higher pressure won't be as enriched as it was down here. Now, I could still do this procedure. I could just do more of them. So it takes a little bit of judiciousness to figure out how to optimize that. In the end, though, you can continue to walk your way down through these coexistence curves and purify repeatedly the component B, the less volatile of them, and end up with some amount of it. And there'll be some balance between the amount that you feel like you need to end up with and how pure you need it to be. Any questions about how this works?\nSo purification of less volatile components. Now, how much of each of these quantities in each of these phases? So, pertinent to this discussion, of course we need to know that. If you want to try to optimize a procedure like that, of course it's going to be crucial to be able to understand and calculate for any pressure that you decide to raise to, just how many moles do you have in each of the phases? So at the end of the day, you can figure out, OK, now when I reach a certain degree of purification, here's how much of the stuff I end up with. Well, that turns out to be reasonably straightforward to do. And so what I'll go through is a simple mathematical derivation. And it turns out that it allows you to just read right off the diagram how much of each material you're going to end up with.\nSo, here's what happens. This is something called the lever rule. How much of each component is there in each phase? So let's consider a case like this. Let me draw yet once again, just to get the numbering consistent. With how we'll treat this. So we're going to start here. And I want to draw it right in the middle, so I've got plenty of room. And we're going to go up to some pressure. And somewhere out there, now I can go to my coexistence curves. Liquid. And gas. And I can read off my values. So this is the liquid xB. So I'm going to go up to some point two, here's xB of two. Here's yB of two. Great. Now let's get these written in.\nSo let's just define terms a little bit. nA, nB. Or just our total number of moles. ng and n liquid, of course, total number of moles. In the gas and liquid phases. So let's just do the calculation for each of these two cases. We'll start with one. That's the easier case. Because then we have only the gas. So at one, all gas. It says pure gas in the notes, but of course that isn't the pure gas. It's the mixture of the two components. So. How many moles of A? Well it's the mole fraction of A in the gas. Times the total number of moles in the gas. Let me put one in here. Just to be clear. And since we have all gas, the number of moles in the gas is just the total number of moles. So this is just yA at one times n total. Let's just write that in. And of course n total is equal to nA plus nB.\nSo now let's look at condition two. Now we have to look a little more carefully. Because we have a liquid gas mixture. So nA is equal to yA at pressure two. Times the number of moles of gas at pressure two. Plus xA, at pressure two, times the number of moles of liquid at pressure two.\nNow, of course, these things have to be equal. The total number of moles of A didn't change, right? So those are equal. Then yA of two times ng of two. Plus xA of two times n liquid of two, that's equal to yA of one times n total. Which is of course equal to yA of one times n gas at two plus n liquid at two. I suppose I could be, add that equality. Of course, it's an obvious one. But let me do it anyway. The total number of moles is equal to nA plus nB. But it's also equal to n liquid plus n gas. And that's all I'm taking advantage of here.\nAnd now I'm just going to rearrange the terms. So I'm going to write yA at one minus yA at two, times ng at two, is equal to, and I'm going to take the other terms, the xA term. xA of two minus yA of one times n liquid at two. So I've just rearranged the terms. And I've done that because now, I think I omitted something here. yA of one times ng. No, I forgot a bracket, is what I did. yA of one there. And I did this because now I want to do is look at the ratio of liquid to gas at pressure two. So, ratio of I'll put it gas to liquid, that's ng of two over n liquid at two. And that's just equal to xA of two minus yA at one minus yA at one minus yA at two.\nSo what does it mean? It's the ratio of these lever arms. That's what it's telling me. I can look, so I raise the pressure up to two. And so here's xB at two, here's yB at two. And I'm here somewhere. And this little amount and this little amount, that's that difference. And it's just telling me that ratio of those arms is the ratio of the total number of moles of gas to liquid. And that's great. Because now when I go back to the problem that we were just looking at, where I say, well I'm going to purify the less volatile component by raising the pressure until I'm at coexistence starting in the gas phase. Raise the pressure, I've got some liquid. But I also want some finite amount of liquid. But I don't want to just, when I get the very, very first drop of liquid now collected, of course it's enriched in the less volatile component. But there may be a minuscule amount, right? So I'll raise the pressure a bit more. I'll go up in pressure. And now, of course, when I do that the amount of enrichment of the liquid isn't as big as it was if I just raised it up enough to barely have any liquid. Then I'd be out here. But I've got more material in the liquid phase to collect. And that's what this allows me to calculate. Is how much do I get in the end. So it's very handy. You can also see, if I go all the way to the limit where the mole fraction in the liquid at the end is equal to what it was in the gas when I started, what that says is that there's no more gas left any more. In other words, these two things are equal. If I go all the way to the point where I've got all the, this is the amount I started with, in the pure gas phase, now I keep raising it all the way. Until I've got the same mole fraction in the liquid. Of course, we know what that really means. That means that I've gone all the way from pure gas to pure liquid. And the mole fraction in that case has to be the same. And what this is just telling us mathematically is, when that happens this is zero. That means I don't have any gas left. Yeah.\nPROFESSOR: No. Because, so it's the mole fraction in the gas phase. But you've started with some amount that it's only going to go down from there.\nPROFESSOR: Yeah. Yeah. Any other questions? OK.\nWell, now what I want to do is just put up a slightly different kind of diagram, but different in an important way. Namely, instead of showing the mole fractions as a function of the pressure. And I haven't written it in, but all of these are at constant temperature, right? I've assumed the temperature is constant in all these things. Now let's consider the other possibility, the other simple possibility, which is, let's hold the pressure constant and vary the temperature. Of course, you know in the lab, that's usually what's easiest to do. Now, unfortunately, the arithmetic gets more complicated. It's not monumentally complicated, but here in this case, where you have one linear relationship, which is very convenient. From Raoult's law. And then you have one non-linear relationship there for the mole fraction of the gas. In the case of temperature, they're both, neither one is linear. Nevertheless, we can just sketch what the diagram looks like. And of course it's very useful to do that, and see how to read off it. And I should say the derivation of the curves isn't particularly complicated. It's not particularly more complicated than what I think you saw last time to derive this. There's no complicated math involved. But the point is, the derivation doesn't yield a linear relationship for either the gas or the liquid part of the coexistence curve.\nOK, so we're going to look at temperature and mole fraction phase diagrams. Again, a little more complicated mathematically but more practical in real use. And this is T. And here is the, sort of, form that these things take. So again, neither one is linear. Up here, now, of course if you raise the temperatures, that's where you end up with gas. If you lower the temperature, you condense and get the liquid. So, this is TA star. TB star. So now I want to stick with A as the more volatile component. At constant temperature, that meant that pA star is bigger than pB star. In other words, the vapor pressure over pure liquid A is higher than the vapor pressure over pure liquid B. Similarly, now I've got constant pressure and really what I'm looking at, let's say I'm at the limit where I've got the pure liquid. Or the pure A. And now I'm going to, let's say, raise the temperature until I'm at the liquid-gas equilibrium. That's just the boiling point. So if A is the more volatile component, it has the lower boiling point. And that's what this reflects. So higher pB star A corresponds to lower TA star A. Which is just the boiling point of pure A.\nSo, this is called the bubble line. That's called the dew line. All that means is, let's say I'm at high temperature. I've got all gas. Right no coexistence, no liquid yet. And I start to cool things off. Just to where I just barely start to get liquid. What you see that as is, dew starts forming. A little bit of condensation. If you're outside, it means on the grass a little bit of dew is forming. Similarly, if I start at low temperature, all liquid now I start raising the temperature until I just start to boil. I just start to see the first bubbles forming. And so that's why these things have those names.\nSo now let's just follow along what happens when I do the same sort of thing that I illustrated there. I want to start at one point in this phase diagram. And then start changing the conditions. So let's start here. So I'm going to start all in the liquid phase. That is, the temperature is low. Here's xB. And my original temperature. Now I'm going to raise it. So if I raise it a little bit, I reach a point at which I first start to boil. Start to find some gas above the liquid. And if I look right here, that'll be my composition. Let me raise it a little farther, now that we've already seen the lever rule and so forth. I'll raise it up to here. And that means that out here, I suppose I should do here.\nSo, here is the liquid mole fraction at temperature two. xB at temperature two. This is yB at temperature two. The gas mole fraction. So as you should expect, what's going to happen here is that the gas, this is going to be lower in B. A, that means that the mole fraction of A must be higher in the gas phase. That's one minus yB. So xA is one minus -- yA, which is one minus yB higher in gas phase. Than xA, which is one minus xB. In other words, the less volatile component is enriched up in the gas phase.\nNow, what does that mean? That means I could follow the same sort of procedure that I indicated before when we looked at the pressure mole fraction phase diagram. Namely, I could do this and now I could take the gas phase. Which has less of B. It has more of A. And I can collect it. And then I can reduce the temperature. So it liquefies. So I can condense it, in other words. So now I'm going to start with, let's say I lower the temperature enough so I've got basically pure liquid. But its composition is the same as the gas here. Because of course that's what that liquid is formed from. I collected the gas and separated it. So now I could start all over again. Except instead of being here, I'll be down here. And then I can raise the temperature again. To some place where I choose. I could choose here, and go all the way to hear. A great amount of enrichment. But I know from the lever rule that if I do that, I'm going to have precious little material over here. So I might prefer to raise the temperature a little more. Still get a substantial amount of enrichment. And now I've got, in the gas phase, I'll further enriched in component A. And again I can collect the gas. Condense it. Now I'm out here somewhere, I've got all liquid and I'll raise the temperature again. And I can again keep walking my way over.\nAnd that's what happens during an ordinary distillation. Each step of the distillation walks along in the phase diagram at some selected point. And of course what you're doing is, you're always condensing the gas. And starting with fresh liquid that now is enriched in more volatile of the components. So of course if you're really purifying, say, ethanol from an ethanol water mixture, that's how you do it. Ethanol is the more volatile component. So a still is set up. It will boil the stuff and collect the gas and and condense it. And boil it again, and so forth. And the whole thing can be set up in a very efficient way. So you have essentially continuous distillation. Where you have a whole sequence of collection and condensation and reheating and so forth events. So then, in a practical way, it's possible to walk quite far along the distillation, the coexistence curve, and distill to really a high degree of purification. Any questions about how that works? OK.\nI'll leave till next time the discussion of the chemical potentials. But what we'll do, just to foreshadow a little bit, what I'll do at the beginning of the next lecture is what's at the end of your notes here. Which is just to say OK, now if we look at Raoult's law, it's straightforward to say what is the chemical potential for each of the substances in the liquid and the gas phase. Of course, it has to be equal. Given that, that's for an ideal solution. We can gain some insight from that. And then look at real solutions, non-ideal solutions, and understand a lot of their behavior as well. Just from starting from our understanding of what the chemical potential does even in a simple ideal mixture. So we'll look at the chemical potentials. And then we'll look at non-ideal solution mixtures next time. See you then.","id":"<urn:uuid:246f9a12-fd35-40fa-8257-b07bf8d92857>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/ocw.mit.edu\/courses\/chemistry\/5-60-thermodynamics-kinetics-spring-2008\/video-lectures\/lecture-21-ideal-solutions\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9636554718,"token_count":7164,"score":3.921875,"int_score":4}
{"text":"St. Bernard of Menthon\nBorn in 923, probably in the castle Menthon near Annecy, in Savoy ; died at Novara, 1008. He was descended from a rich, noble family and received a thorough education. He refused to enter an honorable marriage proposed by his father and decided to devote himself to the service of the Church. Placing himself under the direction of Peter, Archdeacon of Aosta, under whose guidance he rapidly progressed, Bernard was ordained priest and on account of his learning and virtue was made Archdeacon of Aosta (966), having charge of the government of the diocese under the bishop. Seeing the ignorance and idolatry still prevailing among the people of the Alps, he resolved to devote himself to their conversion. For forty two years he continued to preach the Gospel to these people and carried the light of faith even into many cantons of Lombardy, effecting numerous conversions and working many miracles.\nFor another reason, however, Bernard's name will forever be famous in history. Since the most ancient times there was a path across the Pennine Alps leading from the valley of Aosta to the Swiss canton of Valais, over what is now the pass of the Great St. Bernard. This pass is covered with perpetual snow from seven to eight feet deep, and drifts sometimes accumulate to the height of forty feet. Though the pass was extremely dangerous, especially in the springtime on account of avalanches, yet it was often used by French and German pilgrims on their way to Rome. For the convenience and protection of travelers St. Bernard founded a monastery and hospice at the highest point of the pass, 8,000 feet above sea-level, in the year 962. A few years later he established another hospice on the Little St. Bernard, a mountain of the Graian Alps, 7,076 feet above sea-level. Both were placed in charge of Augustinian monks after pontifical approval had been obtained by him during a visit to Rome.\nThese hospices are renowned for the generous hospitality extended to all travelers over the Great and Little St. Bernard, so called in honor of the founder of these charitable institutions. At all seasons of the year, but especially during heavy snow-storms, the heroic monks accompanied by their well-trained dogs, go out in search of victims who may have succumbed to the severity of the weather. They offer food, clothing, and shelter to the unfortunate travelers and take care of the dead. They depend on gifts and collections for sustenance. At present, the order consists of about forty members, the majority of whom live at the hospice while some have charge of neighboring parishes.\nThe last act of St. Bernard's life was the reconciliation of two noblemen whose strife threatened a fatal issue. He was interred in the cloister of St. Lawrence. Venerated as a saint from the twelfth century in many places of Piedmont (Aosta, Novara, Brescia ), he was not canonized until 1681, by Innocent XI. His feast is celebrated on the 15th of June.\nMore Catholic Encyclopedia\nBrowse Encyclopedia by Alphabet\nThe Catholic Encyclopedia is the most comprehensive resource on Catholic teaching, history, and information ever gathered in all of human history.

{"text":"The clutch assembly consists of a clutch disc, a clutch pressure plate, and a clutch release bearing. All these components are usually replaced at the same time. The clutch assembly has two key functions: it transmits power produced by the engine to the gearbox, and it allows that power to be interrupted when the clutch pedal is depressed. Power produced by the engine requires this interruption. It makes it possible to change gears and to shift into neutral at a traffic light or stop sign.\nWhen the clutch assembly is not operating correctly, two things can happen. It either doesn't interrupt the power from the engine to the gearbox, which causes grinding sounds and difficulty in selecting gears. Or it fails to transmit the drive from the engine to the gearbox. This results in the engine \u201crevving up\u201d without the vehicle speed increasing. In the case of a complete failure, the engine will rev up, but the vehicle will not move. Clutch components naturally wear out. Clutch components may fail or wear due to; bad driving habits, being driven with the clutch improperly adjusted, or from exposure to oil.\nTo replace the clutch assembly, the driveshaft (or half shafts where applicable) and the manual transmission (gearbox) must be removed to gain access to the clutch components. New clutch components are fitted and the gearbox is then reinstalled.","id":"<urn:uuid:33218927-4548-4a5c-a711-b4aee4521596>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/repairpal.com\/clutch-assembly-replacement","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9411017299,"token_count":278,"score":2.921875,"int_score":3}
{"text":"The lushly forested nation of Guyana on Thursday joined a regional pact to protect jaguars, the elusive spotted cat that is the biggest land predator in the Americas, but is vulnerable due to expanded agriculture and mining that have carved away at their fragmented habitat.\nLeaders of the government\u2019s environment ministry were signing an agreement with the New York-based conservation group Panthera, which is trying to establish a \u201cjaguar corridor,\u201d a network of pathways that would link core jaguar populations from northern Argentina to Mexico. Guyana is pledging to ensure the protection of jaguars, the national animal that is a near-threatened species.\nThe South American nation with some of the region\u2019s least spoiled wilderness joins Colombia and nations in Central America in recognizing the corridor and agreeing to work toward the long-term conservation of jaguars, said Esteban Payan, regional director for Panthera\u2019s northern South America jaguar program.\nA network of cameras equipped with motion sensors and fixed to tree trunks has revealed tantalizing glimpses of sleek, solitary jaguars slinking through Guyana\u2019s dense rain forests and vast grasslands stretching to the country\u2019s border with Brazil.\nScientists reported finding a relatively healthy jaguar density of three to four animals per 100km in Guyana\u2019s southern Rupununi Savannah. That means that preserving grasslands are as important to conservation of jaguars as protecting the dense rain forests, they say.\nEvi Paemelaere, a Belgian jaguar scientist with Panthera, said Amerindian villagers in remote spots in Guyana have helped her set up cameras along the roads and hunting trails that the big cats like to travel on.\n\u201cAmerindians are very keen on being part of the project,\u201d she said from Georgetown, Guyana\u2019s capital.\nJaguars once roamed widely from the southwestern US to Argentina, but have lost nearly half of their natural territory and have disappeared altogether from some countries. Heavy hunting for their spotted coats decimated their numbers in the 1960s and early 1970s until the pelt trade was largely halted.\nNo one has any reliable estimates of how many jaguars are left in the wild, where they prey on peccaries, tapirs and, since they are powerful swimmers, river turtles.","id":"<urn:uuid:94624377-bc33-4086-9a8a-4a938d5239c2>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.taipeitimes.com\/News\/world\/print\/2013\/01\/26\/2003553502","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9510083795,"token_count":494,"score":3.171875,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Intellectual disability begins in childhood. People with intellectual disability have limits in their mental functioning seen in below-average intelligence (IQ) tests and in their ability to communicate, socialize, and take care of their everyday needs. The degree of disability can vary from person to person. It can be categorized as mild, moderate, severe, or profound.\nSome causes of intellectual disability can be prevented with proper medical care. Children diagnosed with an intellectual disability are most successful when they get help early in life. If you suspect that your child may have an intellectual disability, contact your doctor.\nSeveral hundred causes of intellectual disability have been discovered, but many are still unknown. The most common ones are:\nBiomedical causes resulting from:\n- Abnormal genes inherited from parents\n- Errors when genes combine, such as Down syndrome and Fragile X syndrome\n- Nutritional deficiencies\n- Metabolic conditions, such as phenylketonuria (PKU), galactosemia , and congenital hypothyroidism\n- Developmental brain abnormality, such as hydrocephalus and brain malformation\n- Infections during pregnancy, such as:\n- Behavioral issues during pregnancy, such as:\nProblems at birth, such as:\n- Premature delivery or low birth weight\n- Baby doesn\u2019t get enough oxygen during birth\n- Baby is injured during birth\nFactors during childhood, such as:\n- Nutritional deficiencies\n- Illnesses or infections that affect the brain, including meningitis , encephalitis , chickenpox , whooping cough , and measles\n- Exposure to lead , mercury , and other toxins\n- Head injury or near drowning\n- Social factors, such as child stimulation and adult responsiveness\n- Educational deficiencies\nA child could be at higher risk for intellectual disability due to any of the causes listed above, or due to intellectual disability in other family members. If you are concerned that your child is at risk, tell your child's doctor.\nSymptoms appear before a child reaches age 18. Symptoms vary depending on the degree of the intellectual disability. If you think your child has any of these symptoms, do not assume it is due to intellectual disability. These symptoms may be caused by other, less serious health conditions.\n- Learning and developing more slowly than other children of the same age\n- Difficulty communicating or socializing with others\n- Lower than average scores on IQ tests\n- Trouble learning in school\n- Inability to do everyday things like getting dressed or using the bathroom without help\n- Difficulty hearing, seeing, walking, or talking\n- Inability to think logically\nThe following categories are often used to describe the level of intellectual disability:\n- IQ 50-70\n- Slower than normal in all areas\n- No unusual physical signs\n- Can learn practical skills\n- Reading and math skills up to grades 3-6\n- Can conform socially\n- Can learn daily task skills\n- Functions in society\n- IQ 35-49\n- Noticeable delays, particularly speech\n- May have unusual physical signs\n- Can learn simple communication\n- Can learn elementary health and safety skills\n- Can participate in simple activities and self-care\n- Can perform supervised tasks\n- Can travel alone to familiar places\n- IQ 20-34\n- Significant delays in some areas; may walk late\n- Little or no communication skills, but some understanding of speech with some response\n- Can be taught daily routines and repetitive activities\n- May be trained in simple self-care\n- Needs direction and supervision socially\n- IQ <20\n- Significant delays in all areas\n- Congenital abnormalities present\n- Needs close supervision\n- Requires attendant care\n- May respond to regular physical and social activity\n- Not capable of self-care\nIf you suspect your child is not developing skills on time, tell the doctor as soon as possible. Your doctor will ask about your child\u2019s symptoms and medical history. A physical exam will be done. Standardized tests may be given that measure:\n- Intelligence\u2014IQ tests measure a person\u2019s ability to do things such as think abstractly, learn, and solve problems. A child may have intellectual disability if IQ test results are 70 or below.\nAdaptive behavior\u2014These are skills needed to function in everyday life, including:\n- Conceptual skills like reading and writing\n- Social skills like responsibility and self-esteem\n- Practical skills like the ability to eat, use the bathroom, and get dressed\nChildren with intellectual disability have a higher risk for other disabilities such as hearing impairment , visual problems, seizures , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , or orthopaedic conditions. Additional testing may be needed to check for other conditions.\nTalk with your doctor about the best treatment plan for your child. Treatment is most helpful if it begins as early as possible. Treatment includes:\n- Early intervention programming for infants and toddlers up to age three\n- Family counseling\n- Human development training, including emotional skills and hand-eye coordination\n- Special education programs\n- Life skills training, such as preparing food, bathing\n- Job coaching\n- Social opportunities\n- Housing services\nTo help reduce your child\u2019s chance of becoming intellectually disabled, take the following steps:\n- During pregnancy:\n- Have your newborn screened for conditions that may produce intellectual disability.\n- Have your child properly immunized .\n- Schedule regular visits to the pediatrician.\n- Use child safety seats and bicycle helmets.\n- Remove lead-based paint from your home.\n- Keep poisonous household products out of reach .\n- Aspirin is not recommended for children or teens with a current or recent viral infection.

{"text":"For the first time since 1415, we are going to have a conclave or papal election with no Pope to bury beforehand. But the procedures for the election are not affected by this \u2018novelty.\u2019 Dan Brown might seem an unlikely source for information on a Papal election but the detailed description in Angels and Demons was apparently taken from a book by a Jesuit scholar and is quite accurate.\nWhen the See of Rome is declared vacant \u2013 normally when a Pope dies \u2013 most of the senior prelates who were the Pope\u2019s \u2018ministers\u2019 resign. Power is entrusted to a cardinal called the Camerlengo, in this case Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, who under normal circumstances would bury the Pope.\nThe last papal election took 48 hours, but such speed wasn\u2019t always the case. In the 13th century the papacy was vacant for a year-and-a-half and an election was forced by the people of Rome who locked up the cardinals until a pope was elected. In another case, the people not only locked up the cardinals, they tore off the roof of the building and put the cardinals on a diet of bread and water.\nNow, with Benedict\u2019s resignation the cardinals are essentially being given a \u2018month\u2019s notice\u2019 and can plan their trip to Rome and think about what they want in the new pope. In a sense, because of the pre-planning that can be brought to bear on this election, there is potentially a lot of time to consider who should be the next leader of the world\u2019s 1 billion catholics.\nThe cardinals will stay in a specially constructed 5 storey residence inside the Vatican walls, Santa Marta. and will be conveyed by coach to the Sistine Chapel for morning and afternoon sessions there. The process of election must begin no more than 20 days after the see is vacant. Only cardinals under the age of 80 can enter the conclave \u2013 the word means \u2018with a key\u2019 in Latin, referring to the fact that the Cardinals are locked into the election hall.\nThere are 119 eligible to vote, 67 of whom were appointed by Benedict and the rest by JPII. Cardinals who are excommunicated can actually attend but not those who have resigned. A cardinal who resigned and joined Napolean Bonaparte attempted to enter the conclave in 1800 but was refused.\nOn the morning of the conclave the cardinals con-celebrate Mass in St Peter\u2019s Basilica. In the afternoon they gather in the Pauline Chapel in the Apostolic Palace and solemnly process in full red and white regalia with red hats and enter the Sistine chapel, with the doors locked behind them. All telephones, cell phones, radios, televisions and internet connections are removed from use whether in the chapel or in the residence. They cannot leave except in the case of grave illness. Also permitted in the conclave are two medical doctors, a nurse for very ill cardinals, and religious priests who can hear confessions in various languages. These have to swear absolute and perpetual secrecy.\nThe cardinals swear an oath of secrecy not to discuss the elections outside the Chapel and everyone else is ordered out in the Latin words \u201cExtra omnes,\u201d \u201cEverybody out.\u201d The doors of the Sistine Chapel and the Residence of the Cardinals are closed.\nInside, a meditation is given concerning the grave duty of the cardinals and they are exhorted to \u201conly have God before your eyes.\u201d The rest of the time is spent for prayer and voting in silence, there are no campaign speeches. Negotiations and arguments have to take place outside.\nIn the Chapel, which dates from the 15th Century, and under the ceiling adorned with Michelangelo's Last Judgement, the cardinals can cast their vote. There will be four ballots daily until a clear majority is found for one candidate.\nIt is severely frowned upon to seek the office of Pope and canvassing for it is severely prohibited, especially prior to a Pope dying. It is an office bestowed upon a person rather than their contesting for it. However an outsider could be elected pope and in theory it could be a lay person willing to be ordained a priest and bishop but the weight of tradition suggests it will be one of the cardinals gathered in the Sistine chapel. The last non cardinal was Pope Urban in 1378.\nHowever, discussions prior to a ballot among cardinals do occur privately but public campaigning would be counter productive. Dinners are good vehicles for discussions. However, the best known cardinals tend to be the ones that work in the Vatican and meet other bishops, and cardinals when they come on business to Rome.\nThe ballot is secret and Pope John Paul II abolished two methods of election: by compromise or by common consent. Since 1179, a new Pope requires a two thirds majority. Now, after 33 ballots, a simple majority is enough. If there is no progress in choosing a candidate, a day of prayer is set aside. However, not since 1831 has an election lasted more than four days.\nThe ballot papers themselves are rectangular with \u201cI elect as supreme pontiff\u201d printed at the top and each cardinal prints or writes a name in a way that disguises his handwriting. One at a time they approach the altar with the folded ballot held up, he kneels and prays and then places the ballot in a silver and gilded bronze urn, much like a wok with a lid. Cardinals called \u2018scrutineers\u2019 count the ballots. After the ballots are read aloud they are placed on a thread and placed in another urn. They are then burnt.\nSince 1903, white smoke from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel has signalled the election of a pope; black smoke signals another vote.\nWhen a pope is finally elected, the cardinal dean asks him, \u201cDo you accept your canonical election as supreme pontiff?\u201d Rarely does anyone say no. St Philip Benize was offered it in 1271 and fled and hid until another candidate was chosen.\nSacristy of Tears\nAfter the \u2018yes\u2019, he is led into the \u2018Sacristy of Tears\u2019 or commonly called \u2018Room of Tears,\u2019 a small room off the Sistine Chapel. It is here that the enormity of what has just happened hits the new Pope, though the tears may be of sorrow or joy. Traditionally they were said to be tears of humility as a Pope was following in the footsteps of St Peter; others would contend the tears were because essentially the Pope becomes a \u2018prisoner\u2019 of the Vatican and would be bowed down by the weight of the office.\nThe new Pope picks one of three sizes of Papal garments \u2013 presumably small, medium or large \u2013 and return to the High Altar to receive the homage of the cardinals. Meanwhile, the ballots are burnt in a stove with a chemical which turns the smoke white, telling the world of the newly elected Pontiff.\nA Cardinal is then sent to the Loggia of the Benedictions on the fa\u00e7ade of St Peter\u2019s where he says: \u201cAnnuntio vobis gaudium magnum. I announce to you a great joy! Habemus Papam. We have a Pope!\u201d He then announces the name of the cardinal and the name he has chosen to use as Pope.\nThe new Pope steps onto the balcony and therefore onto the stage of world and church history. He may grant his first blessing to the world.\nSome days later, the new Pope will go down into the foundations of St Peter\u2019s to the tomb of Peter, the first Pope and first bishop of Rome, and pray. Then with all the cardinals, he will process into St Peter\u2019s Square to begin his first public Mass and receive the main symbols of his office: the fisherman\u2019s ring and the pallium.","id":"<urn:uuid:fe661bb9-3884-4391-9c13-161ffd3496bc>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.irishcentral.com\/news\/What-to-expect-at-Conclave-in-unusual-case-of-Pope-Benedict-stepping-down-from-Vatican-role-191795261.html?mob-ua=mobile","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9714189172,"token_count":1662,"score":2.78125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"COGNITIVE MORAL DEVELOPMENT AND LOEVINGER'S CONCEPT OF EGO DEVELOPMENT (KOHLBERG)\nThis study explored the nature of the relationship between cognitive moral development as defined by Lawrence Kohlberg and ego development as defined by Jane Loevinger. The effects of general cognitive development were controlled by the selection of subjects who were capable of formal operational thinking. Subjects were 120 Jewish volunteers comprised of equal numbers of junior high-school, senior high-school, and college students of both sexes. All subjects received three tests: A Screening Measure for Formal Operations, The Sentence Completion Test (SCT) which measures ego development, and The Moral Judgment Interview (MJI). Results indicated the existence of significant positive correlations between the SCT and MJI in the overall sample, in the total male and female samples, in the entire college group, and in the female college group. No significant correlations were found in the junior high-school and senior high-school groups, possibly due to restricted ranges of scores. In addition, most subjects at moral development stages 3\/4 and above had attained at least the conscientious-conformist level. Results also indicated the presence of differences between male and female scores. The correlations for females were consistently higher than for males, females scored significantly higher on the SCT, males scored significantly higher on the MJI, and the relationship between specific moral and ego development stages seemed to be stronger for females than for males. The differences found in this study between the sexes in performance on the MJI are consistent with Gilligan's theory about the distinctions between male and female approaches to moral dilemmas. However, that theory was found to be inadequate in explaining the stronger relationship between MJI and SCT scores manifested by the females in this study. The SCT was criticized for not specifying clearly the ego development features that it measured. It was suggested that the exact nature of the interplay between moral and ego development could be illuminated more fully by research that focused on specific well-defined features of ego development. ^\n\"COGNITIVE MORAL DEVELOPMENT AND LOEVINGER'S CONCEPT OF EGO DEVELOPMENT (KOHLBERG)\"\n(January 1, 1984).\nETD Collection for Fordham University.","id":"<urn:uuid:f696ba90-1549-4d50-a12f-3bce184b3072>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/fordham.bepress.com\/dissertations\/AAI8506343\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9681007862,"token_count":476,"score":2.9375,"int_score":3}

Check out some of the ways below:\nThe World\u2019s Longest Toilet Queue is a mass mobilization event and Guinness World Record attempt bringing together thousands of campaigners from across the world to demand real change.\nEver seen water flow uphill? Without help of petrol or electricity? Meet the hydraulic ram, a robust and simple water-powered water pump. The ram pumps uses the power of water with a height difference flowing in the spring, stream or river to lift a fraction of the water up to 200 meters vertically, and sometimes pump it over a kilometre or two to where it is needed. No fuel or electricity required. The ram pump holds great potential for rural drinking water and irrigation water supply in hilly and mountainous areas, such as Afghanistan, Colombia, Nepal, and the Philippines.\nPhoto above: Children surrounding a hydraulic ram produced by AIDFI on the island Negros, the Philippines.\nIf you are in the Los Angeles area, come celebrate World Water Day with a Night of Generosity at SKYBAR on March 22nd at 8pm.\nWater is big business. Just five beverage companies consume enough water over the course of a year to satisfy the daily water needs of every person on the planet. Of course, we may not be able to control how much water is put in a can of soda or a beer (less water, more alcohol, please) or the amount it takes to make paper, but we can control our own use at the workplace and even influence those who manage supplies.\nIt may not be our nickel that gets spent on the utility bill at work, but the gains are certainly ours when we reduce the corporate water footprint on the planet. Water prices are poised to rise due to increased water stress, and corporate growth is expected to be impeded as resources dwindle. Make no mistake, all of this comes out of our paychecks in one way or another.\nAt this very moment, millions of women are carrying 40 pounds of water on the return leg of their average 3.5-mile daily trek.\nSo today, on International Women's Day, I want to pay tribute to the resiliency of these women, and highlight the collective possibility they embody -- if freed from the back-breaking and time-consuming burden of collecting water.\nProviding women with access to a nearby source of clean water frees up their days to earn an income or engage in other more productive activities \u2013 which can help significantly elevate their status in the community.\nphoto by Beth Harper via Creative Commons.\nOutdoors is where we as residents tend to use huge amounts of water. In some parts of the country, mostly out in the arid West, 70 percent or more of residential water is used for lawn irrigation.\nSomething is seriously wrong with this picture. Pink flamingos and fountains aside, decorative lawns that need lots of care and lots of water are scourges. It may be that suburbia is making the wells run dry. Indeed, homeowners use an average of 120 gallons of water each day for things outside.\nThink about that for a second: \"things outside\" -- where rain should be able to do the job nicely -- if we stick with the vegetation that grows naturally in our locale, that is. Irrigation, my dear water-freak neighbor, was invented to keep our fields of food alive, not your imported turf.\nUN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon and former U.S. President Bill Clinton unveiled a new United Nations program to raise money to help fight HIV\/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and more. Through the program, called MASSIVEGOOD, travelers can donate a minimum of $2 on top of their airfare to support an international UN Health financing initiative by clicking on MASSIVEGOOD. Five clicks, the equivalent of $10, bought an insecticide-treated bed net, while 25 clicks was enough to pay for a year\u2019s worth of HIV medication for one child.\nAround the world, most boreholes are drilled with big, heavy equipment which arrives by truck, makes a lot of noise, and gets the job done in a short time, at a cost of about $5,000 to $20,000 per borehole. But there is a growing interest in doing it in a different way -- drilling by hand. It takes longer, it is heavy work, but it also gets the job done. Why are people getting interested? A hand-drilled borehole costs about $500 or less.\nL\u00e4karmissionen is one of our NGO partners in Sweden and is helping us to fight the global water crisis.

{"text":"Mary Anne Dunkin\nLouise Chang, MD\nTwo decades ago, if you had moderate to severe Crohn's, there were few treatment options. In the late 1990s, however, the first in a new class of treatment options emerged for Crohn's disease. Referred to as biologic response modifiers, biologic agents, or simply biologics, these drugs target specific parts of an overactive immune system to reduce inflammation.\nBiologics not only relieve Crohn's symptoms but also can bring about remission and keep you in remission. They are indicated for use when someone has moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease and has not responded well to other Crohn\u2019s disease treatments. Many people with Crohn's now live with significantly fewer symptoms, but may worry about side effects. Here's a look at the risks and benefits of biologics.\nIn Crohn's disease, an overactive immune system causes inflammation and damage to the digestive tract. Made from living organisms, biologics work just like substances made by the body\u2019s immune system and can help control the immune system response.\nFour biologics are FDA approved for Crohn's. Three of the four block a protein called tumor necrosis factor (TNF) that's involved in inflammation. These drugs are often called anti-TNF drugs or TNF inhibitors. They include Cimzia (certolizumab), Humira (adalimumab), and Remicade (infliximab).\nThe fourth medication, Tysabri (natalizumab), is called an integrin receptor antagonist. It blocks certain types of white blood cells that are involved in inflammation.\nBecause they suppress the immune system, all biologics carry an increased risk of infections, which in rare cases can be serious. Cimzia, Humira, and Remicade carry a boxed warning for increased risk of serious infections leading to hospitalization or death. If someone taking a biologic develops a serious infection, the drug should be discontinued. People with tuberculosis, heart failure, or multiple sclerosis should not take biologics because they can bring on these conditions or make them worse.\nIn rare cases, some people taking TNF inhibitors have developed certain cancers such as lymphoma. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymph system, which is part of the body\u2019s immune system.\nTysabri increases the risk of a very rare but potentially fatal brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Tysabri also can cause allergic reactions and liver damage. Tysabri should not be used at the same time as other treatments that suppress the immune system or TNF inhibitors.\nHowever, most infections that occur with biologic use are far less serious, says Richard Bloomfeld, MD, associate professor of medicine and director of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston Salem, N.C. \"Infections such as colds, upper respiratory tract infections, and urinary tract infections are common and don't necessarily alter our treatment of Crohn's.\"\nOther common side effects from biologic use include headache, flu-like symptoms, nausea, rash, injection site pain, and infusion reactions.\nSo who should take a biologic for Crohn's? Many gastroenterologists reserve these drugs for people who have not responded to conventional medications that suppress the immune system. But some gastroenterologists may treat Crohn's more aggressively.\n\"If you let inflammation go, inflammation leads to scarring and scarring leads to narrowing of the intestines, which becomes a surgical problem,\" says Prabhakar Swaroop, MD, assistant professor and director of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. \"You want to treat the person aggressively to prevent these problems.\"\n\"In addition to improving symptoms, the anti-TNF modifiers are associated with mucosal healing,\" says Bloomfeld. \"We hope that in healing the mucosa we can stop the progression of the disease and prevent complications of Crohn's that result in hospitalization and surgery.\"\nWhile there are other treatments that suppress the immune system to treat Crohn's, they too have side effects, says Bloomfeld. Like the biologics, drugs that suppress the immune system increase the risk of lymphomas and infections, which can be severe.\nCortiosteroids like prednisone, for example, can cause a wide range of adverse effects including weight gain, mood swings, bone loss, skin bruising, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar. Those side effects are why corticosteroids may be used to control a flare, but aren't the choice to treat Crohn's over a long period of time. \"The stop-gap method, which is steroids, is something we cannot use long term,\" says Swaroop.\nWhen prescribing any drug, doctors look at the potential risks against the benefits they hope or expect to achieve. Although doctors don't all share the same philosophy on when to start biologics for Crohn's disease, they do agree that biologics should be used when people have severe disease that can lead to permanent damage and make surgery unavoidable.\nSwaroop says he looks for signs that the disease is progressing, such as how long between a person's diagnosis of Crohn's and when they have fistulas. \"These are the patients who generally do better on biologics, who have the quality of life improvement, who are able to avoid surgery and get back in the workforce,\" he says.\nBefore prescribing biologics, doctors check for potential problems. \"In the beginning, of course, we go ahead and make sure the person does not have an active liver infection or TB,\" says Marie Borum, MD, professor of medicine and director of the Division of Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.\nOnce someone starts a biologic, the doctor looks for side effects in order to find them before they become serious. Monitoring includes include lab tests and possibly regular skin checks for signs of skin cancer.\nAll effective therapies for Crohn's disease come with some risk, says Bloomfeld. \"It is not an option not to treat Crohn's, so we certainly need to weigh these risks against the benefits of having the disease well treated.\"\n\"It may be challenging for the individual to consider all of these risk and benefits. They need to work with their gastroenterologist to decide what might be most beneficial for them and what risk they are willing to accept to effectively treat Crohn's disease,\" Bloomfeld says. \"You have to be willing to accept some risk to adequately treat Crohn's disease.\"\nSOURCES:Crohn's Colitis Foundation of America: \"Biologic Therapies.\"Marie Borum, MD, professor of medicine; director, Division of Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, George Washington University, Washington, D.C.Richard Bloomfeld, MD, associate professor of medicine; director, Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston Salem, N.C.Prabhakar Swaroop, MD, assistant professor; director, Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas.\nHere are the most recent story comments.View All\nThe views expressed here do not necessarily represent those of NewsSource 16\nThe Health News section does not provide medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.

{"text":"Ulva spp. on freshwater-influenced or unstable upper eulittoral rock\nEcological and functional relationships\nThe community predominantly consists of algae which cover the rock surface and creates a patchy canopy. In doing so, the algae provides an amenable habitat in an otherwise hostile environment, exploitable on a temporary basis by other species. For instance, Ulva intestinalis provides shelter for the orange harpacticoid copepod, Tigriopus brevicornis, and the chironomid larva of Halocladius fucicola (McAllen, 1999). The copepod and chironomid species utilize the hollow thalli of Ulva intestinalis as a moist refuge from desiccation when rockpools completely dry. Several hundred individuals of Tigriopus brevicornis have been observed in a single thallus of Ulva intestinalis (McAllen, 1999). The occasional grazing gastropods that survive in this biotope no doubt graze Ulva.\nSeasonal and longer term change\n- During the winter, elevated levels of freshwater runoff would be expected owing to seasonal rainfall. Also, winter storm action may disturb the relatively soft substratum of chalk and firm mud, or boulders may be overturned.\n- Seasonal fluctuation in the abundance of Ulva spp. Would therefore be expected with the biotope thriving in winter months. Porphyra also tends to be regarded as a winter seaweed, abundant from late autumn to the succeeding spring, owing to the fact that the blade shaped fronds of the gametophyte develop in early autumn, whilst the microscopic filamentous stages of the spring and summer are less apparent (see recruitment process, below).\nHabitat structure and complexity\nHabitat complexity in this biotope is relatively limited in comparison to other biotopes. The upper shore substrata, consisting of chalk, firm mud, bedrock or boulders, will probably offer a variety of surfaces for colonization, whilst the patchy covering of ephemeral algae provides a refuge for faunal species and an additional substratum for colonization. However, species diversity in this biotope is poor owing to disturbance and changes in the prevailing environmental factors, e.g. desiccation, salinity and temperature. Only species able to tolerate changes\/disturbance or those able to seek refuge will thrive.\nThe biotope is characterized by primary producers. Rocky shore communities are highly productive and are an important source of food and nutrients for neighbouring terrestrial and marine ecosystems (Hill et al., 1998). Macroalgae exude considerable amounts of dissolved organic carbon which is taken up readily by bacteria and may even be taken up directly by some larger invertebrates. Dissolved organic carbon, algal fragments and microbial film organisms are continually removed by the sea. This may enter the food chain of local, subtidal ecosystems, or be exported further offshore. Rocky shores make a contribution to the food of many marine species through the production of planktonic larvae and propagules which contribute to pelagic food chains.\nThe life histories of common algae on the shore are generally complex and varied, but follow a basic pattern, whereby there is an alternation of a haploid, gamete-producing phase (gametophyte-producing eggs and sperm) and a diploid spore-producing (sporophyte) phase. All have dispersive phases which are circulated around in the water column before settling on the rock and growing into a germling (Hawkins & Jones, 1992).\nUlva intestinalis is generally considered to be an opportunistic species, with an 'r-type' strategy for survival. The r-strategists have a high growth rate and high reproductive rate. For instance, the thalli of Ulva intestinalis, which arise from spores and zygotes, grow within a few weeks into thalli that reproduce again, and the majority of the cell contents are converted into reproductive cells. The species is also capable of dispersal over a considerable distance. For instance, Amsler & Searles (1980) showed that 'swarmers' of a coastal population of Ulva reached exposed artificial substrata on a submarine plateau 35 km away.\nThe life cycle of Porphyra involves a heteromorphic (of different form) alternation of generations, that are either blade shaped or filamentous. Two kinds of reproductive bodies (male and female (carpogonium)) are found on the blade shaped frond of Porphyra that is abundant during winter. On release these fuse and thereafter, division of the fertilized carpogonium is mitotic, and packets of diploid carpospores are formed. The released carpospores develop into the 'conchocelis' phase (the diploid sporophyte consisting of microscopic filaments), which bore into shells (and probably the chalk rock) and grow vegetatively. The conchocelis filaments reproduce asexually. In the presence of decreasing day length and falling temperatures, terminal cells of the conchocelis phase produce conchospores inside conchosporangia. Meiosis occurs during the germination of the conchospore and produces the macroscopic gametophyte (blade shaped phase) and the cycle is repeated (Cole & Conway, 1980).\nTime for community to reach maturity\nDisturbance is an important factor structuring the biotope, consequently the biotope is characterized by ephemeral algae able to rapidly exploit newly available substrata and that are tolerant of changes in the prevailing conditions, e.g. temperature, salinity and desiccation. For instance, following the Torrey Canyon tanker oil spill in mid March 1967, which bleached filamentous algae such as Ulva and adhered to the thin fronds of Porphyra, which after a few weeks became brittle and were washed away, regeneration of Porphyra and Ulva was noted by the end of April at Marazion, Cornwall. Similarly, at Sennen Cove where rocks had completely lost their cover of Porphyra and Ulva during April, by mid-May had occasional blade-shaped fronds of Porphyra sp. up to 15 cm long. These had either regenerated from basal parts of the 'Porphyra' phase or from the 'conchocelis' phase on the rocks (see recruitment processes). By mid-August these regenerated specimens were common and well grown but darkly pigmented and reproductively immature. Besides the Porphyra, a very thick coating of Ulva (as Enteromorpha) was recorded in mid-August (Smith 1968). Such evidence suggests that the community would reach maturity relatively rapidly and probably be considered mature in terms of the species present and ability to reproduce well within six months.\nNo text entered.\nThis review can be cited as follows:\nUlva spp. on freshwater-influenced or unstable upper eulittoral rock.\nMarine Life Information Network: Biology and Sensitivity Key Information Sub-programme [on-line].\nPlymouth: Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.\nAvailable from: <http:\/\/www.marlin.ac.uk\/habitatecology.php?habitatid=104&code=2004>","id":"<urn:uuid:13da434f-f140-49e3-8fdb-67019653693a>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.marlin.ac.uk\/habitatecology.php?habitatid=104&code=2004&code=2004","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.912592113,"token_count":1520,"score":3.625,"int_score":4}

{"text":"Although uncommon, an entirely different group of factors plays a role when an athlete suffers a stroke.\nHead and neck trauma are often factors in stroke during athletic competitions. Direct head trauma can result in leakage from blood vessels, depriving large regions of the brain of necessary nutrients.\nViolent forward and backward movement of the head can result in tearing the inner lining of vital arteries responsible for directing blood to the brain. This condition, known as arterial dissection, can form a clot within the affected blood vessel or become a source of small clots. These smaller clots often move toward the brain as emboli and block other arteries.\nTreatment for arterial dissection involves the use of blood thinning medications and avoiding violent collision sports.\nAnother common risk factor for stroke in athletes is the existence of a patent foramen ovale (PFO). A PFO is a hole between the upper chambers of the heart, the right and left atria. The foramen ovale forms in the fourth week of embryonic development and should close in the first three months after birth. When it does not close, it is considered patent or open.\nThis abnormal channel allows direct passage of blood clots to the brain. These clots often originate in the legs and may result from immobilized lower extremities.\nPFOs can be treated with equal success by surgical closure or blood thinning medications. Athletes appear to do better with surgical closure and usually make a full recovery to return to sports.\nWhile considered rare, strokes do occur in athletes and treatment requires a different approach.","id":"<urn:uuid:42e960c1-33b4-4f11-8d2f-5ec7df76d856>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/dralessi.blogspot.com\/2011_05_01_archive.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9354484081,"token_count":320,"score":3.46875,"int_score":3}

{"text":"If a powerful hurricane slams the Louisiana coast during the Republican National Convention, the resonances with Katrina will be bad enough. But the storm would also showcase the GOP\u2019s position on climate change, which is, increasingly, to deny the scientific consensus that fossil-fuel pollution contributes to a warming atmosphere and destructive weather patterns\u2014including stronger hurricanes.\nAlthough scientists caution that no single weather event can be attributed directly to climate change, major events such as Katrina and this summer\u2019s drought fire up a debate that has become more incendiary in recent years as more Republican lawmakers doubt climate science.\nThe question of whether the GOP accepts climate science didn\u2019t come up in 2008, when Hurricane Gustav slammed into the Gulf Coast during the party\u2019s Minnesota convention. That\u2019s because the nominee, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, believed in climate change and professed a desire to solve it.\nSince then, the mainstream GOP view is to deny the scientific findings that link man-made pollution to climate change, and Mitt Romney has publicly walked back his onetime position that humans contribute to warming. Vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan has also questioned the science.\nBut stronger hurricanes are among the most serious consequences of climate change induced by the burning of fossil fuels (the Romney campaign favors such burning), and the Gulf Coast is likely to experience the worst effects, according to a 2012 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and a 2009 report authored by 13 federal agencies.\nKerry Emanuel, a climate scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has authored one of many reports on the increasing frequency of high-intensity hurricanes, said that the data link warming air and water surfaces to stronger, more devastating hurricanes.\n\u201cAs the temperature of the tropical ocean increases, you see greater intensity and the frequency of intense storms goes up,\u201d Emanuel said.\nMichael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences at Princeton University and a member of the Nobel Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said the science shows clearly that reducing oil, coal, and gas pollution could help prevent damage related to climate change. \u201cThere\u2019s a risk, which scientists have identified, that it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll have more strong hurricanes, and one of the things we can do to prepare is reduce fossil-fuel emissions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just like building levees.\u201d\nEnvironmentalists are targeting Republicans for their views. Around Tampa, the Florida Wildlife Federation has posted billboards of prominent Republicans, such as Ohio Gov. John Kasich and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who have acknowledged climate change as a problem and called for solutions.\n\u201cWe think this is one of the most important policy issues that there is,\u201d said Federation President Manley Fuller. \u201cIt\u2019s treated as a partisan issue, and it should not be. The billboards remind Republicans of what well-known Republicans have said about this.\u201d\nLast week, the League of Conservation Voters launched a $1.5 million campaign to defeat five House Republicans who deny the science of climate change. The \u201cFlat Earth Five\u201d campaign is the first time the League has targeted a group of lawmakers explicitly because of their positions on climate.\nWant to stay ahead of the curve?

However, studies of root growth and N uptake are often restricted to a depth of 1 m or less, as root biomass is assumed to be negligible below this depth. We have studied the importance of root growth and N uptake to a depth of 2.5 m in fully grown field vegetables and cover crops by use of minirhizotrons and deep point placement of 15N. Deep rooted crucifereous crops were found to have high root densities to a depth of 1.5-2 m and high 15N uptake to this depth. The work shows that knowledge of the interactions between root growth and soil N below a depth of 1 m are important to understand crop N uptake and nitrate leaching from agro-ecosystems.\n|EPrint Type:||Conference paper, poster, etc.|\n|Type of presentation:||Paper|\n|Subjects:|| Soil > Nutrient turnover|\nCrop husbandry > Crop combinations and interactions\nCrop husbandry > Production systems > Vegetables\n|Research affiliation:|| Denmark > DARCOF III (2005-2010) > VEGQURE - Organic cropping Systems for Vegetable production|\nDenmark > AU - Aarhus University > AU, DJF - Faculty of Agricultural Sciences\n|Deposited By:||Kristensen, Ph.D. Hanne L.|\n|Deposited On:||28 Nov 2007|\n|Last Modified:||12 Apr 2010 07:35|\n|Refereed:||Peer-reviewed and accepted|\nRepository Staff Only: item control page","id":"<urn:uuid:d2b3502d-1c86-4ed7-9c72-a55bc162b976>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/orgprints.org\/11461\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.7870572805,"token_count":527,"score":2.90625,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Water creatures caught stealing DNA\nTiny freshwater organisms that have a sex-free lifestyle, may have survived so well because they steal genes from other creatures, US scientists report.\nResearchers from the Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, have found genes from bacteria, fungi and even plants incorporated into the DNA of bdelloid rotifers - minuscule animals that appear to have given up sex 40 million years ago.\nTheir report appears in this week's edition of Science.\nSex is used by most life forms as a way of coping with changing circumstances, by allowing organisms to develop useful new genes and ditch harmful, mutated ones.\nThe resilience of bdelloid and their sex-free lifestyle has stumped scientists.\nThe team, headed by Professor Matthew Meselson, looked at the DNA of bdelloid rotifers to see how they manage to survive and evolve.\nIt appears they overcome this hurdle by stealing DNA from our organisms.\n\"Our result shows that genes can enter the genomes of bdelloids in a manner fundamentally different from that which, in other animals, results from the mating of males and females,\" says Meselson.\n\"We found many genes that appear to have originated in bacteria, fungi, and plants.\"\nThe translucent, waterborne creatures, which range in size from 0.1 to 1 millimetres long, lay eggs, but all their offspring are female.\nThe researchers believe that when bdelloids dry out, they fracture their genetic material and rupture cellular membranes. When they rehydrate, they rebuild their genomes and their membranes, incorporating shreds of genetic material from other bdelloids and unrelated species in their vicinity.\n\"These fascinating animals not only have relaxed the barriers to incorporation of foreign genetic material, but, more surprisingly, they even managed to keep some of these alien genes functional,\" report co-author Dr Irina Arkhipova says.\nAccording to the researchers, the next step is to determine whether bdelloid genomes also contain homologous genes imported from other bdelloids.\nMeselson and his colleagues also hope to examine whether the animals actually use any of the hundreds of snippets of foreign DNA they appear to vacuum up.\nUnderstanding how the animals acquire and make use of these new genes could have implications for medicine.\nGenetic mutations, which occur constantly in any living organism, underlie cancer, heart disease and various other diseases.","id":"<urn:uuid:7ccc0e8f-b8e3-42aa-8ed8-47b14f3a075c>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.abc.net.au\/science\/articles\/2008\/05\/30\/2260287.htm?site=science&topic=latest","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9405416846,"token_count":498,"score":3.328125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"There are many ways to effectively teach a dog.\nNot so long ago, most of the accepted methods for training were forceful or aversive. Unfortunately, some of these methods still are in use among the abusive and uneducated.\nOne of the pioneers of gentle training techniques was Barbara Woodhouse. This English dog trainer was instrumental in paving the way for today\u2019s nonaversive and positive methods of training. She was a genius at molding behaviors with lures and gently \u201cmodeling\u201d a dog into positions without force. But even Woodhouse used some techniques that can be considered rough by today\u2019s standards.\nIf you have researched dog-training methodologies at all, you probably have noticed that a percentage of the available training books advocate the use of a \u201cchoke chain\u201d (otherwise called the training collar). When used properly, this training device relies on aversion to get the dog\u2019s attention or to make a correction when your dog doesn\u2019t respond to a command correctly. A sharp snap of the leash tightens the collar around the dog\u2019s neck, startling the dog with a momentary, low-level pain.\nThe choke chain is not a training device for leash pullers, as is commonly thought, and when used incorrectly can, at the least, cause misalignment of the spine and trachea damage. At worst, it can cause brain damage and even death. Because there is such a high risk for misuse of this device (you may not realize that the choke chain should be worn with the free ring up, for instance), the training world probably would be much better off without it.\nYour efforts to train your dog should focus on building a bond and nurturing trust. This bond becomes the motivator that drives your dog to learn, focus and respond.\nWhy would anyone want to use force or violence when positive reinforcement works so well? Why should your dog trust you if he knows that you are likely to hit him when he is unfocused or confused? That\u2019s like your supervisor yelling at you when you have problems with a difficult task. Stress won\u2019t help you concentrate or focus better. Abusive treatment of dogs in the name of training, just as abusive handling of employees in the name of supervision, doesn\u2019t work. It does, however, tell us a lot about the trainer.\nFor any method of dog training to be successful, it must be:\nEffective \u2013 If it\u2019s not effective, what\u2019s the point?\nEfficient \u2013 Both you and your dog will become frustrated if training takes too long.\nEnjoyable \u2013 Fun is an important ingredient in motivating both you and your dog.\nThe proper execution of any training program is dependent on these three ingredients.\nBut, ultimately, the most important ingredient in your training program is you, the owner. The trust you nurture in your dog will be evident in his willingness to look to you for leadership and his motivation to work with you in any and all situations. Those qualities are in your dog right now but cannot be developed through the use of harsh training methods.\nDog training can be whatever you want it to be. If you rely on anger and force, the relationship and trust will suffer. If you rely on motivation and reward, while providing appropriate consequences for misdeeds, training just gets better and better.\nJulie Winkelman is a certified pet dog trainer and a certified dog trainer.

{"text":"Gallup has conducted an expansive survey in an attempt to determine how many people openly identify as a member of the LGBT community across the United States. While the difference between specific states was not particularly significant, research Gary Gates points out that the findings do show that states with more protections for LGBT people tend to have more out LGBT people:\nIn general, states where residents express more liberal views are more accepting of LGBT individuals, while socially conservative areas are less accepting. Of the 10 states and D.C. where at least 4% of respondents identified as LGBT, seven are among the most liberal states in the country. Conversely, six of 10 states with the lowest percentage of LGBT-identified adults are among the top 10 conservative states in the country.\nThe states with proportionally larger LGBT populations generally have supportive LGBT legal climates. With the exception of South Dakota, all of the states that have LGBT populations of at least 4% have laws that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity and allow same-sex couples to marry, enter into a civil union, or register as domestic partners. Of the 10 states with the lowest percentage of LGBT adults, only Iowa has such laws.\nWith demographics, it\u2019s always important to keep in mind that the number represents something very specific: the number of people who are willing to disclose their identity to an anonymous pollster. It doesn\u2019t represent the number of people who are actually gay but don\u2019t want to tell a pollster, who don\u2019t yet know that they\u2019re gay, who deny that they\u2019re gay, or who don\u2019t identify as gay but do engage in same-sex behavior.\nStill, these numbers are telling. The health benefits of coming out are well documented, so in an indirect way, these results show that having laws that protect LGBT people not only protect them from discrimination, but support their mental health and well-being. Indeed, the value of such positive climates is arguably a more compelling conclusion from this study than the demographics themselves.\nHere\u2019s how the states ranked in terms of how many people identified as LGBT:","id":"<urn:uuid:41ffb0fa-f19f-487f-9298-2ab9b0a074cb>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/thinkprogress.org\/lgbt\/2013\/02\/15\/1601181\/survey-openly-lgbt-people-tend-to-live-in-liberal-inclusive-states\/?mobile=nc","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9636510015,"token_count":434,"score":2.828125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"The life-giving ideas of chemistry are not reducible to physics. Or, if one tries to reduce them, they wilt at the edges, lose not only much of their meaning, but interest too. And, most importantly, they lose their chemical utility\u2014their ability to relate seemingly disparate compounds to each other, their fecundity in inspiring new experiments. I'm thinking of concepts such as the chemical bond, a functional group and the logic of substitution, aromaticity, steric effects, acidity and basicity, electronegativity and oxidation-reduction. As well as some theoretical ideas I've been involved in personally\u2014through-bond coupling, orbital symmetry control, the isolobal analogy.\nConsider the notion of oxidation state. If you had to choose two words to epitomize the same-and-not-the-same nature of chemistry, would you not pick ferrous and ferric? The concept evolved at the end of the 19th century (not without confusion with \"valency\"), when the reality of ions in solution was established. As did a multiplicity of notations\u2014ferrous iron is iron in an oxidation state of +2 (or is it 2+?) or Fe(II). Schemes for assigning oxidation states (sometimes called oxidation numbers) adorn every introductory chemistry text. They begin with the indisputable: In compounds, the oxidation states of the most electronegative elements (those that hold on most tightly to their valence electrons), oxygen and fluorine for example, are \u20132 and \u20131, respectively. After that the rules grow ornate, desperately struggling to balance wide applicability with simplicity.\nThe oxidation-state scheme had tremendous classificatory power (for inorganic compounds, not organic ones) from the beginning. Think of the sky blue color of chromium(II) versus the violet or green of chromium(III) salts, the four distinctly colored oxidation states of vanadium. Oliver Sacks writes beautifully of the attraction of these colors for a boy starting out in chemistry. And not only boys.\nBut there was more to oxidation states than just describing color. Or balancing equations. Chemistry is transformation. The utility of oxidation states dovetailed with the logic of oxidizing and reducing agents\u2014molecules and ions that with ease removed or added electrons to other molecules. Between electron transfer and proton transfer you have much of reaction chemistry.\nI want to tell you how this logic leads to quite incredible compounds, but first let's look for trouble. Not for molecules\u2014only for the human beings thinking about them.\nThose Charges are Real, Aren't They?\nIron is not only ferrous or ferric, but also comes in oxidation states ranging from +6 (in BaFeO4) to \u20132 (in Fe(CO)42\u2013, a good organometallic reagent).\nIs there really a charge of +6 on the iron in the first compound and a \u20132 charge in the carbonylate? Of course not, as Linus Pauling told us in one of his many correct (among some incorrect) intuitions. Such large charge separation in a molecule is unnatural. Those iron ions aren't bare\u2014the metal center is surrounded by more or less tightly bound \"ligands\" of other simple ions (Cl\u2013 for instance) or molecular groupings (CN\u2013, H2O, PH3, CO). The surrounding ligands act as sources or sinks of electrons, partly neutralizing the formal charge of the central metal atom. At the end, the net charge on a metal ion, regardless of its oxidation state, rarely lies outside the limits of +1 to \u20131.\nActually, my question should have been countered critically by another: How do you define the charge on an atom? A problem indeed. A Socratic dialogue on the concept would bring us to the unreality of dividing up electrons so they are all assigned to atoms and not partly to bonds. A kind of tortured pushing of quantum mechanical, delocalized reality into a classical, localized, electrostatic frame. In the course of that discussion it would become clear that the idea of a charge on an atom is a theoretical one, that it necessitates definition of regions of space and algorithms for divvying up electron density. And that discussion would devolve, no doubt acrimoniously, into a fight over the merits of uniquely defined but arbitrary protocols for assigning that density. People in the trade will recognize that I'm talking about \"Mulliken population analysis\" or \"natural bond analysis\" or Richard Bader's beautifully worked out scheme for dividing up space in a molecule.\nWhat about experiment? Is there an observable that might gauge a charge on an atom? I think photoelectron spectroscopies (ESCA or Auger) come the closest. Here one measures the energy necessary to promote an inner-core electron to a higher level or to ionize it. Atoms in different oxidation states do tend to group themselves at certain energies. But the theoretical framework that relates these spectra to charges depends on the same assumptions that bedevil the definition of a charge on an atom.\nAn oxidation state bears little relation to the actual charge on the atom (except in the interior of the sun, where ligands are gone, there is plenty of energy, and you can have iron in oxidation states up to +26). This doesn't stop the occasional theoretician today from making a heap of a story when the copper in a formal Cu(III) complex comes out of a calculation bearing a charge of, say, +0.51.\nNor does it stop oxidation states from being just plain useful. Many chemical reactions involve electron transfer, with an attendant complex of changes in chemical, physical and biological properties. Oxidation state, a formalism and not a representation of the actual electron density at a metal center, is a wonderful way to \"bookkeep\" electrons in the course of a reaction. Even if that electron, whether added or removed, spends a good part of its time on the ligands.\nBut enough theory, or, as some of my colleagues would sigh, anthropomorphic platitudes. Let's look at some beautiful chemistry of extreme oxidation states.\nIncredible, But True\nRecently, a young Polish postdoctoral associate, Wojciech Grochala, led me to look with him at the chemical and theoretical design of novel high-temperature superconductors. We focused on silver (Ag) fluorides (F) with silver in oxidation states II and III. The reasoning that led us there is described in our forthcoming paper. For now let me tell you about some chemistry that I learned in the process. I can only characterize this chemistry as incredible but true. (Some will say that I should have known about it, since it was hardly hidden, but the fact is I didn't.)\nHere is what Ag(II), unique to fluorides, can do. In anhydrous HF solutions it oxidizes Xe to Xe(II), generates C6F6+ salts from perfluorobenzene, takes perfluoropropylene to perfluoropropane, and liberates IrF6 from its stable anion. These reactions may seem abstruse to a nonchemist, but believe me, it's not easy to find a reagent that would accomplish them.\nAg(III) is an even stronger oxidizing agent. It oxidizes MF6\u2013 (where M=Pt or Ru) to MF6. Here is what Neil Bartlett at the University of California at Berkeley writes of one reaction: \"Samples of AgF3 reacted incandescently with metal surfaces when frictional heat from scratching or grinding of the AgF3 occurred.\"\nAg(II), Ag(III) and F are all about equally hungry for electrons. Throw them one, and it's not at all a sure thing that the electron will wind up on the fluorine to produce fluoride (F\u2013). It may go to the silver instead, in which case you may get some F2 from the recombination of F atoms.\nNot that everyone can (or wants to) do chemistry in anhydrous HF, with F2 as a reagent or being produced as well. In a recent microreview, Thomas O'Donnell says (with some understatement), \"... this solvent may seem to be an unlikely choice for a model solvent system, given its reactivity towards the usual materials of construction of scientific equipment.\" (And its reactivity with the \"materials of construction\" of human beings working with that equipment!) But, O'Donnell goes on to say, \"... with the availability of spectroscopic and electrochemical equipment constructed from fluorocarbons such as Teflon and Kel-F, synthetic sapphire and platinum, manipulation of and physicochemical investigation of HF solutions in closed systems is now reasonably straightforward.\"\nFor this we must thank the pioneers in the field\u2014generations of fluorine chemists, but especially Bartlett and Boris Zemva of the University of Ljubljana. Bartlett reports the oxidation of AgF2 to AgF4\u2013 (as KAgF4) using photochemical irradiation of F2 in anhydrous HF (made less acidic by adding KF to the HF). And Zemva used Kr2+ (in KrF2) to react with AgF2 in anhydrous HF in the presence of XeF6 to make XeF5+AgF4\u2013. What a startling list of reagents!\nTo appreciate the difficulty and the inspiration of this chemistry, one must look at the original papers, or at the informal letters of the few who have tried it. You can find some of Neil Bartlett's commentary in the article that Wojciech and I wrote, and in an interview with him.\nCharge It, Please\nChemists are always changing things. How to tune the propensity of a given oxidation state to oxidize or reduce? One way to do it is by changing the charge on the molecule that contains the oxidizing or reducing center. The syntheses of the silver fluorides cited above contain some splendid examples of this strategy. Let me use Bartlett's words again, just explaining that \"electronegativity\" gauges in some rough way the tendency of an atom to hold on to electrons. (High electronegativity means the electron is strongly held, low electronegativity that it is weakly held.)\nIt's easy to make a high oxidation state in an anion because an anion is electron-rich. The electronegativity is lower for a given oxidation state in an anion than it is in a neutral molecule. That in turn, is lower than it is in a cation. If I take silver and I expose it to fluorine in the presence of fluoride ion, in HF, and expose it to light to break of F2 to atoms, I convert the silver to silver(III), AgF4-. This is easy because the AG(III) is in an anion. I can then pass in boron trifluoride and precipitate silver trifluoride, which is now a much more potent oxidizer than AgF4- because the electronegativity in the neutral AgF3 is much higher than it is in the anion. If I can now take away a fluoride ion, and make a cation, I drive the electronegativity even further up. With such a cation, for example, AgF2+, I can steal the electron from PtF6- and make PtF6.... This is an oxidation that even Kr(II) is unable to bring about.\nSimple, but powerful reasoning. And it works.\nA World Record?\nFinally, a recent oxidation-state curiosity: What is the highest oxidation state one could get in a neutral molecule? Pekka Pyykk\u00f6 and coworkers suggest cautiously, but I think believably, that octahedral UO6, that is U(XII), may exist. There is evidence from other molecules that uranium 6p orbitals can get involved in bonding, which is what they would have to do in UO6.\nWhat wonderful chemistry has come\u2014and still promises to come\u2014from the imperfect logic of oxidation states!\n\u00a9 Roald Hoffmann\nI am grateful to Wojciech Grochala, Robert Fay and Debra Rolison for corrections and comments.

{"text":"Tuscaloosa, located at the falls of the Black Warrior River in west central Alabama, is the the fifth-largest city in Alabama with a population of 90,468, and the seat of Tuscaloosa County. It is named for the Choctaw chieftain Tuskalusa (meaning Black Warrior), who battled and was defeated by Hernando de Soto in 1540 in the Battle of Mauvila.\nBest known as the home of the University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa is also the center of industry, commerce, healthcare, and education for the region commonly known as West Alabama.\nThe area at the fall line of what would be later known as the Black Warrior River had long been well known to the various Indian tribes whose shifting fortunes brought them to West Alabama. The river shoals at Tuscaloosa represented the southernmost site on the river which could be forded under most conditions. Inevitably, a network of Indian trails converged upon the place, the same network which, in the first years of the 19th Century began to lead a few white frontiersmen to the area.\nThe pace of white settlement increased greatly after the War of 1812, and a small assortment of log cabins soon arose near the large Creek village at the fall line of the river, which the settlers named in honor of the legendary Chief Tuscaloosa. In 1817, Alabama became a territory, and on December 13, 1819, the territorial legislature incorporated the town of Tuscaloosa, exactly one day before the United States Congress admitted Alabama to the Union as a state.\nFrom 1826 to 1846 Tuscaloosa was the capital of Alabama. During this period, in 1831, the University of Alabama was established. The town's population and economy grew rapidly until the departure of the capital to Montgomery caused a rapid decline in population. Establishment of the Bryce State Hospital for the Insane in Tuscaloosa in the 1850s helped restore the city's fortunes. During the Civil War following Alabama's secession from the Union, several thousand men from Tuscaloosa fought in the Confederate armies. During the last weeks of the War, a brigade of Union troops raiding the city burned the campus of the University of Alabama. Tuscaloosa, too, suffered much damage from the battle and shared fully in the South's economic sufferings which followed the defeat.\nThe construction of a system of locks and dams on the Black Warrior River by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the 1890s opened up an inexpensive link to the Gulf seaport of Mobile, stimulating especially the mining and metallurgical industries of the region. By the advent of the 20th Century, the growth of the University of Alabama and the mental health-care facilities in the city, along with strong national economy fueled a steady growth in Tuscaloosa which continued unabated for 100 years. Manufacturing plants of large firms such as Michelin and JVC located in town during the latter half of the 20th Century. However, it was the announcement of the addition of the Mercedes-Benz US International assembly plant in 1993 that best personified the new era of economic prosperity for Tuscaloosa.\n Geography and climate\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, Tuscaloosa has a total area of 66.7 square miles. 56.2 mi\u00b2 of it is land and 10.5 mi\u00b2 of it (15.7%) is water. Most of water within the city limits is in Lake Tuscaloosa, which is entirely in the city limits, and the Black Warrior River.\nTuscaloosa lies approximately 60 miles southwest of Birmingham, at the fall line of the Black Warrior River on the boundary between the Appalachian Highland and the Gulf Coastal Plain approximately 120 miles upriver from its confluence with the Tombigbee River in Demopolis. Consequently, the geography of the area around Tuscaloosa is quite diverse, being hilly and forested to the northeast and low-lying and marshy to the southwest.\nThe area experiences a typical Southern subtropical climate with four distinct seasons. The Gulf of Mexico heavily influences the climate by supplying the region with warm, moist air. During the fall, winter and spring seasons, the interaction of this warm, moist air with cooler, drier air from the North along fronts create precipitation.\nNotable exceptions occur during hurricane season where storms may move from due south to due north or even from east to west during land-falling hurricanes. The interaction between low- and high-pressure air masses is most pronounced during the severe weather seasons in the spring and fall. During the summer, the jet streams flows well to the north of the southeastern U.S., and most precipitation is consequently convectional, that is, caused by the warm surface heating the air above.\nWinter lasts from mid-December to late-February; temperatures range from the mid-20s to the mid-50s. On average, the low temperature falls at freezing or below about 50 days a year. While rain is abundant (an average 5.09 in. per month from Dec.-Feb.), measurable snowfall is rare; the average annual snowfall is about 0.6 inches. Spring usually lasts from late-February to mid-May; temperatures range from the mid-50s to the low-80s and monthly rainfall amounts average about 5.05 in. (128 mm) per month. Summers last from mid-May to mid-September; temperatures range from the upper-60s to the mid-90s, with temperatures above 100\u00b0F not uncommon, and average rainfall dip slightly to 3.97 in. per month. Autumn, which spans from mid-September to early-December, tends to be similar to Spring terms of temperature and precipitation.\nAs of the census of 2000 there were 77,906 people, 31,381 households, and 16,945 families residing in the city.

The mayor is elected by the city at-large and serves four-year terms. Council members are elected to single-member districts every four years as well. Neither the mayor nor the members of the city council is term-limited. All elected offices are nonpartisan.\nThe mayor administers the day-to-day operations of the city, including overseeing the various city departments, over whom he has hiring and firing power. The mayor also acts as ambassador of the city. The mayor sits in city council meetings and has a tie-breaking vote. The current Mayor of Tuscaloosa is Walter Maddox, who was elected to office is September 2005. Prior to Maddox, Alvin A. DuPont had served as mayor for 24 years.\nThe city council is a legislative body that considers policy and passes law. The council also passes the budget for mayoral approval. Any resolution passed by the council is binding law. The majority of work in the council is done by committee, a usually consisting of a chairman, two other council members, and relevant non-voting city employees.\n|3||Cynthia Lee Almond||2005|\n|7||William Tinker, III||2005|\nTuscaloosa, as the largest county seat in western Alabama, serves a hub of state and federal government agencies.

{"text":"As Christo Pantev prowled the halls of Toronto's Baycrest Center for Geriatric Care he was struck, over and over, by the vitality of many of the elderly patients who played a musical instrument.\n\"I saw much more activity in these people than in the others,\" says Pantev, a neuroscientist at the center's Rotman Research Institute.\nHe saw a difference even among those who were slipping over the edge into dementia. Memory begins to fade as the patients slide toward that dark abyss, but the last thing that goes \u2014 the last bit of memory \u2014 he says, is their ability to remember music.\nAnd he thinks he may know why.\nMusician and Scientist\nHe has developed evidence over the years that the study of music may change the way the human brain is wired. And that has kept him on a course that has guided nearly his entire professional career.\nHe has a few questions he would like to answer, including: Does learning a skill, like playing the violin, physically change the brain and improve cognitive and perceptive skills among children, and maybe even stave off mental illness among the elderly?\nMaybe, he reasons, the intense concentration and the long hours of practice that make someone a skilled musician have benefits that far outweigh the rewards of playing a musical instrument.\nThose are tall questions, but Pantev has spent the last few years laying the groundwork for research that is just getting underway at the institute. As a child, Pantev spent years studying the violin, and it became his passion.\nEven today, he says, \"If I work, I have to hear music.\"\nIn time, the violin gave way to neuroscience, but it was to return later as a key player in his research.\nWhile working at the University of Muenster's Institute for Experimental Audiology in Germany, Panlev and a colleague began studying people who had lost a limb to see how their brains adapted to their new environment. It was known that persons who had lost a hand sometimes felt pain, or other sensations, in their fingers, even though the hand was no longer there.\nThe researchers used sensitive equipment that could measure electric activity and magnetic fields in the brain to see which areas were active when the person reported feeling \"phantom pain\" in the missing limb. The results, published in a 1995 issue of the journal Nature, showed that other parts of the body commandeered the neurons formerly used by the missing limb.\nIf the lip took over those neurons, for example, simply biting the lip caused the person to feel pain in the phantom limb.\nThe research showed that the brain adapted to its new environment by rewiring itself, and that led Pantev to his next question. \"Can we modify the functional brain organization by training?\" he asks.\nPlaying Violin, Wearing a Helmet\nTo answer that, the researchers needed a model, something they could test to see if training had a measurable impact on the brain. Pantev knew from his own experience that playing the violin required far more dexterity in the left hand than the right.\n\"The right hand is much less involved,\" he says.\nPantev, the violinist, thus supplied Pantev, the neuroscientist, with \"the perfect model.\"\nLike the research into phantom pain, the difference between the use of the left hand as opposed to the right gave the researchers something to measure in the brain. Over time, they reasoned, practicing the violin several hours a day should cause a neurological shift in the brain.","id":"<urn:uuid:95c4b4a0-dcf9-4cd2-98d2-a9cd2283e72f>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Technology\/story?id=97835&page=1","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9810381532,"token_count":720,"score":2.78125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Save money with properly inflated tires\n(NewsUSA) - Tire pressure monitoring systems (TPMS) are now a standard safety feature on all new cars in the United States. TPMS automatically monitors tire pressure and alerts the driver when the pressure in one or more tires becomes significantly low -- and potentially dangerous.\nStill, conducting monthly tire pressure checks is one of the smartest driving moves you can make. Not only are properly inflated tires critical for vehicle safety, they also increase fuel efficiency and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.\nIncrease Fuel Efficiency\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Energy, 3.56 million gallons of gasoline are wasted every day due to incorrectly inflated tires. The good news is you can improve gas mileage just by keeping tires inflated to the proper pressure. In fact, one study showed that if gas costs $3 per gallon, proper tire pressure can save you up to $432 at the pump each year.\nReduce Carbon Dioxide Emissions\nAccording to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the typical car in the United States releases more than five tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year. By keeping tires properly inflated, you can reduce your vehicle's \"carbon footprint\" by an average of 327 pounds per year. Because a tire can lose up to half its air pressure without appearing to be under-inflated, you cannot rely on a tire's appearance to determine whether it's properly inflated or not.\nTire Pressure Tips\nTo help ensure your tires are properly inflated year-round, here are some tips from Schrader, a manufacturer of TPMS:\n* Check the pressure in all four tires -- and the spare tire -- monthly with an accurate tire gauge, and always check tire pressure before a long road trip.\n* The \"right\" pressure for your vehicle's tires can be found in the vehicle's manual or on the driver door edge, glove box or fuel door. Do not follow the information listed on the tire sidewall.\n* For the most accurate reading, tires should be checked when they are cool.\n* Always remember to replace the valve cap.\nDistributed by Internet Broadcasting.

{"text":"The vaunted protection that intellectually active adults get from Alzheimer\u2019s disease has a dark downside, a study released Wednesday has found. Once dementia symptoms become evident and Alzheimer\u2019s disease is diagnosed in such patients, their mental decline can come with frightening speed.\nThat finding, published in the journal Neurology, comes from a study of 1,157 Chicago-based seniors who were followed for an average of just over 11 years. Six years after gauging the extent to which the study participants engaged in activities that challenged their mental capacities, researchers from Rush University Medical Center Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Center made periodic assessments of the study participants\u2019 cognitive health and traced the trajectories of their brain health.\nAll told, 148 of the participants were diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease during the follow-up period, and 395 were found to have mild cognitive impairment\u2014intellectual problems that are less severe than Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but which often precede such a diagnosis.\nWhile all participants\u2019 mental function showed yearly declines, the steepest downward trajectories belonged to those who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but who had reported high levels of mental engagement at the outset of the study. Fellow Alzheimer\u2019s sufferers who had not sought out much intellectual stimulation at the study\u2019s outset showed a more gradual decline in their function.\n\u201cIn effect, the results of this study suggest that the benefit of delaying the initial appearance of cognitive impairment [in Alzheimer\u2019s disease] comes at the cost of more rapid dementia progression,\u201d the author wrote.\nThe findings support a common observation of those who treat intellectually minded patients who go on to be diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease\u2014that once diagnosed, their decline is rapid. It also underscores a growing body of evidence that the bright and mentally-active may not beat Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but can hold off its ravages for months or years longer than those who are not so engaged.\nDr. John M. Ringman, a UCLA neurologist and assistant director of the Mary S. Easton Center for Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research, said he sees regular evidence of the phenomenonen in his clinical work, as well as in brain-imaging scans that can detect the physical signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease while a patient is still alive: Patients with a history of intensive mental engagement seem to develop a \u201ccognitive reserve,\u201d said Dr. Ringman. That mental strength frequently allows them to function almost normally, he said, even as the amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that are the hallmarks of the disease have advanced upon the brain.\nBy the time such a patient comes to his office complaining that his memory and mental function are not what they used to be, the disease has progressed significantly, said Ringman. The decline from that point can be precipitous.\nIn a disease that evidence now suggests takes years, perhaps decades, to show up in everyday behavior, Ringman said \u201cit\u2019s hard to quantify this cognitive reserve.\u201d The strength of the study published Wednesday is that it gathered copious evidence of participants\u2019 mental status and activity at the outset and followed them for more than a decade, he added.\n--Melissa Healy\/Los Angeles Times","id":"<urn:uuid:5d156165-181a-4195-a926-d51850c7b599>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/articles.latimes.com\/2010\/sep\/01\/news\/la-heb-alzheimers-20100901","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9584160447,"token_count":679,"score":2.71875,"int_score":3}

Under the direction of E. H. Sellards, Herman Gunter, and S. J. Olsen, the FGS collection was the primary source of fossil vertebrate descriptions from Florida until the early 1960s. World-renown paleontologists such as George G. Simpson, Edwin H. Colbert, and Henry F. Osborn wrote scientific papers about specimens in the FGS collection in addition to Sellards and Olsen. In 1976 the entire FGS fossil vertebrate collection was transferred to the Florida Museum of Natural History with support from a National Science Foundation grant. The UF\/FGS collection is composed of about 22,000 specimens assigned to about 10,000 catalogue numbers, and almost all of them were collected in Florida. The majority of specimens in the UF\/FGS collection are mammals, followed by reptiles, birds, and a relatively small number of amphibians and fish. Although there are some sites that are unique to the UF\/FGS collection, many of the sites overlap with holdings in the main UF and UF\/PB collections. The major strengths of the UF\/FGS collection are historically important samples from the early Miocene Thomas Farm locality, the middle Miocene and early Pliocene deposits of the Bone Valley Region, Polk County, and from the late Pleistocene Vero locality, Indian River County. Researchers using the UF\/FGS database should be aware that when the catalogue data for the FGS collection was first transferred from the original file cards to a computerized database in the late 1980s, relatively little effort was made to correct or improve entries. The nature of specimen was not indicated on many of the cards, locality information was sometimes vague, and many employed taxonomic names that are no longer in use. While some corrections have subsequently been made to this database, limitations of time and resources have prevented an exhaustive clean-up. Also, when Sellards left Florida for Texas in the 1920s, he transferred some, but not all, of the holotypes in the FGS collection that he had named to the USNM collection, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.\nUnited States Geological Survey\nWater Management Districts of Florida\nFor information about the Florida Geological Survey:\nDr. Jon Arthur\nFlorida Geological Survey\n903 West Tennessee Street\nTallahassee, FL 32304-7000\nPhone: (850) 488-4191 Fax: (850) 488-8086\nAcknowledging or Crediting the Florida Geological Survey As Creative Entity or Information Source\nThe Florida Geological Survey is providing many of its publications (State documents) for the purpose of digitization and Internet distribution.

{"text":"Dinosaur Bones \"Buried\" By Evolutionists!\nA recent presentation at the 2012 Western Pacific Geophysics meeting in Singapore showed C-14 dates of soft tissue found in dinosaur bones to be in the range from 22,000 - 39,000 years old. Previously, it has been assumed that dinosaurs died out over 65 million years ago, so these new findings are astonishing and should have made international news. But shortly after the presentation was made at the meeting, the abstract was removed from the meeting\u2019s website!\nSo it appears that instead of making international news, these findings have been buried. First, let\u2019s look at what was actually being presented.\nThe organic matter (collagen) and hard carbonate bone mineral (bioapatite) in the bone samples were analyzed. The samples came from several species of dinosaurs (acrocanthosaur, hadrosaurus, triceratops and apatosaurus) taken from various sites in Texas, Colorado, Arkansas and Montana. The samples were meticulously handled and cleaned to avoid possible contamination. The carbon-14 (C-14) levels in these samples were measured using Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS). The resultant C-14 ages obtained from these samples were consistently in the 22,000 - 39,000 years range. The fact that the samples were from a variety of species and sites all giving consistent results greatly reduces the chance that the results are from contamination.\nThe theoretical upper limit for C-14 dating is ten times the half-life, or about 57,000 years. The proposed practical upper limit for C-14 dating is between 40,000 - 50,000 years. While some samples fell close to the 40,000 year upper limit, 16 out of 20 (80%) were aged at 35,000 years or younger, well within the acceptable upper C-14 dating limits.\nWhile other researchers have found soft tissue in dinosaur bones and C-14 dates in these ranges, this current study has been the most comprehensive. The fact that there is any collagen at all remaining in these bone samples is amazing, considering that they are supposed to be older than 65 million years. Protein just doesn\u2019t hang around that long! And that there is any C-14 in them also is reason to possibly question conventional wisdom. But why have we not heard about any of this in the news? Shouldn't there have been at least a 15-second blip from one of the media outlets? But the media have been silent and the abstract pulled from the meeting proceedings. The sacred cow of evolution once again remains intact.\nWe truly are living in an age of great deception. \u201cAnd for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie.\u201d (2 Thessalonians 2:11)\nThis article, by Creation Moments board member Dr. Don Clark, is based on an interview broadcast by Broken Road Radio.

{"text":"First Homer Encyclopedia Brings Epic Poetry and Ancient Greece to Life Tuesday, April 17, 2012\nTAU researcher sheds light on Homer's reception in the Western, Jewish and Arabic worlds\nHomer, one of the most famous poets of all time, is firmly entrenched in the Western canon as a master of classical literature. His two most renowned works, the Iliad and the Odyssey, are core texts for students and scholars alike. Now, Prof. Margalit Finkelberg of Tel Aviv University's Department of Classics has created an illuminating new tool, the world's first Homer Encyclopedia.\nPublished in three volumes by Wiley-Blackwell last year and more recently in electronic form, the encyclopedia is an invaluable window into Homer's life and work, elucidating the characters and settings of his work from primary characters to the smallest village mentioned in passing. The volumes also examine the pre-history of Homer and the period in which he lived and wrote, and how the text has been received and transmitted by various cultures and societies throughout history to the present day. One of its groundbreaking areas of research is the reception of Homer in the Jewish and Arabic traditions, a subject that has rarely been explored.\nWith contributions from 132 scholars worldwide, this three volume work is a universal exploration of all things Homer. \"Through this encyclopedia, you can enter Homer's world and get lost in it,\" says Prof. Finkelberg, who was recently awarded the 2012 Rothschild Prize in the Humanities. \"It is unique for its comprehensive view \u2014 the entire field is seen as vibrant, alive and contemporary. Homer's work is put in a modern living context, rather than approached as an impenetrable classic monument.\"\nAn avatar of Greek culture\nOne section of the encyclopedia examines \"textual reception\" over 2,000 years of history. Its purpose is to examine how Homeric texts were received from the view of different societies and cultures, e.g. Victorian England. Studying the history of the reception of a major text is an emerging field of study, Prof. Finkelberg explains \u2014 and profoundly important to the progress of the humanities.\nOne of the most original features of this work is an in-depth study of Homer in the context of Jewish and Arabic traditions, conducted by leading specialists. Though Homer's work is foundational to the Western tradition, it has never been central to these Eastern traditions, which put more of an emphasis on \"useful\" texts, such as those regarding science, medicine, and philosophy.\nThe findings, she says, are surprising. Because the Hellenic world is little-known in these cultures, Homer is seen as a symbol of Greek culture in its entirety. \"Poetry was not translated in these cultures, and because of this, very little was known about the art of the Greeks beyond philosophers like Aristotle. For them, Homer represented everything to do with Greek culture, including paganism,\" explains Prof. Finkelberg. Anything \"Greek\" was essentially \"Homeric\" and vice versa.\nProf. Finkelberg believes that the publication is a crucial addition to encyclopedias on the work of other poets such as Dante and Virgil. After all, Homer is not just any writer. In the absence of the sacred religious texts that are central to other traditions, such as the Bible to Judeo-Christian traditions, the Iliad and the Odyssey are the formative texts of Greek culture.\nBecause of this, the fields of Homeric archaeology and Biblical archaeology rest on the same historical axis, suggests Prof. Finkelberg. Homer's use of history reflects real historical events and has inspired actual archaeological discovery. It was through Homer, for example, that German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann was to search for the ruins of Troy, the site of the Trojan War in Homer's works. Previously, the city was believed to be a mere literary invention.\nThough Homer cannot be used as a historical text in the modern sense, Prof. Finkelberg says that his literary works are themselves not unlike an archaeological site, where different levels of history can be pieced together to reveal intriguing tale of a world long past.\nFor more arts and culture news from Tel Aviv University, click here.","id":"<urn:uuid:2803558a-d055-4608-8cef-0426746bf557>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.aftau.org\/site\/News2\/645906549?page=NewsArticle&id=16458&news_iv_ctrl=-1","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9598337412,"token_count":861,"score":2.8125,"int_score":3}

{"text":"February 11, 2011 > Low Fat Doesn't Have to Mean Low Flavor\nLow Fat Doesn't Have to Mean Low Flavor\nLunch and Learn Cooking Demonstration Focuses on Heart Healthy Options\nIn an ideal world, steamed broccoli and that slice of cheesecake in the refrigerator would have the same amount of calories and fat. Sadly, in the real world, that's just not the case. To stay healthy, we have to watch what we eat, and every day decisions we make regarding our diet can have an enormous impact-on a lot of things... The pounds on the scale, our waistline, how much energy we have, and our heart health.\nAccording to data published on the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)'s Web site, the most common heart disease in the United States is coronary heart disease, which often appears as a heart attack. In 2010, an estimated 785,000 Americans had a new coronary attack, and about 470,000 had a recurrent attack. That means every 25 seconds, an American will have a coronary event, and about one every minute will die from one.\nNot surprisingly, heart disease represents the No. 1 cause of death in the United States. For both men and women. And although heart disease is sometimes thought of as a \"man's disease,\" women account for nearly 50 percent of heart disease deaths, the CDC states.\nWhen it comes to risk factors for heart disease, there are some things we can't change, such as our gender, age and genetics. Other things we can. Making sustainable lifestyle changes, like eating a low fat diet, has been shown to help lower the risk of heart disease.\nBut changing old habits isn't as easy as snapping our fingers, is it? Nutrition labels on our favorite foods can be hard to decode-and what about those recipes that call for things like butter, cream cheese and sour cream? Are they banished forever?\nOn Wednesday, Feb. 16, Anna Mazzei, a registered dietitian and certified diabetes educator at Washington Hospital, will be whipping up a Low Fat Cooking Demonstration at the Washington Women's Center to help participants get an idea of how to modify their cooking and eating habits.\n\"National Heart Month is recognized in February, and one of the things that people love are foods that are typically high in fat,\" Mazzei says. \"The question is: how do we get the same satisfaction without as much fat?\"\nDuring her demonstration, Mazzei says she won't be going for an all or nothing approach because, to be successful, it's more about being creative than cutting out anything and everything.\n\"Now in the marketplace there are lighter products available,\" she says. \"You don't have to go to nonfat, but probably to lighter products to help cut down some fat and calories.\"\nItems that are high in fat-like a slice of cheesecake-also pack in the calories with little nutritional reward in the form of essential vitamins and minerals. Whereas a serving of broccoli runs you about 25 calories, the same quantity of cheesecake is more like 250 calories.\n\"I'm going to look at some of the highest fat items and how to scale them down,\" Mazzei explains. \"We're going to do some taste testing and focus on how to take these things and make a satisfying, yet lighter version.\"\nExamples of items Mazzei is going to sample during the food demonstration include:\n* Fried chicken\n* Chicken nuggets\n* Recipes with butter and cream cheese\nAnother great way to improve heart health-and something goes hand in hand with a low fat diet-is exercise. If you missed the evening Exercise for Your Health class at the Women's Center earlier this month, call to find out about the center's range of fitness classes, from gentle yoga to the official Arthritis Foundation's official exercise program.\nIf you're interested in learning more about how to create a tasty, low-fat diet, join Mazzei for her Lunch and Learn cooking demonstration at the Washington Women's Center Conference Room on Wednesday, Feb. 16, from noon to 1 p.m.* The Washington Women's Center is located at 2500 Mowry Ave., Suite 150.\n*Space is limited to 20 participants.

{"text":"A continuation of our predictions of big issues for 2011...\nDon\u2019t expect the debates on teaching quality to end anytime soon. We suspect that data from test scores (a la the Los Angeles Times series of 2010) will continue to be used to determine a teacher\u2019s effectiveness in the classroom. Beyond the problems of relying on one strand of data, this approach also reinforces the unfortunate lack of attention given to the early grades, since statewide tests are typically, and appropriately, not administered to children younger than 8 or 9.\nThis disregard of teacher quality in the early years has led to a sorry state in many schools. A 2007 study published in Science, for example, showed that only 10 percent of poor children experience high-quality instruction throughout their elementary school years. So we applaud the focus on effective teaching in principle. What we wish is that it would go much deeper. Teachers and principals should be assessing the quality of their instruction using research-based tools that feed on most teachers\u2019 desires to improve.\nEarly childhood programs know this already. Tools like the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) are in use throughout the Head Start program and in several state-wide pre-k programs as well. (In fact, they may become a tool for determining which Head Start programs have to re-compete for funds.) These research-based tools use data from minute-by-minute observations of classroom interactions to determine where teachers excel and where they need to change their approach. According to anecdotal reports from teachers in these programs, the observational records are incredibly helpful in honing their craft. Could this be the year for elementary and secondary schools to wake up to the potential of these kinds of tools?\nNext Up: Hot Spot #5, Striving Readers and Other Competitions","id":"<urn:uuid:3d3a52c4-3b81-46a2-a495-28a1c3a3d883>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/earlyed.newamerica.net\/blogposts\/2011\/2011_hot_spots_4_teacher_evaluation-42334","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.958376646,"token_count":361,"score":3.109375,"int_score":3}
{"text":"A simple, inexpensive method for preventing type 2 diabetes that relies on calling people and educating them on the sort of lifestyle changes they could make to avoid developing the disease has proven effective in a study conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and the City of Berkeley Department of Public Health.\nThe study involved 230 people in poor, urban neighborhoods in the San Francisco Bay Area cities of Richmond, Oakland and Berkeley. Contacted by phone about once a month, half of them received specific dietary guidance and other lifestyle counseling. After six months, those who had received the counseling had on average lost more weight, were consuming less fat, were eating more fruits and vegetables and showed more improvements in lowering in their blood triglycerides, a key risk measure for type 2 diabetes.\nDescribed this week in the American Journal of Public Health, the new intervention is specifically designed for urban, poor, and predominantly minority communities. It addresses the need for diabetes prevention interventions in these communities and highlights a simple fact that doctors at UCSF and elsewhere have been repeating for years \u2014 that type 2 diabetes is preventable in the first place.\n\u201cDiabetes is not something you are necessarily going to get just because it runs in your family,\u201d said Alka Kanaya, MD, an associate professor of medicine at UCSF and one of two senior authors on the study. \u201cIt is very preventable, and lifestyle changes can really impact the onset of diabetes.\u201d\n\u201cYou can do something about it,\u201d said Anita Stewart, PhD, a professor at the UCSF Institute for Health & Aging and the Center for Aging in Diverse Communities who is the other senior author on the paper.\nHow Lifestyle Changes Can Prevent Diabetes\nDiabetes is a chronic and complex disease marked by high levels of sugar in the blood that arise due to problems with the hormone insulin, which regulates blood sugar levels. It is usually caused by an inability to produce insulin (type 1) or an inability to respond correctly to insulin (type 2).\nA major health concern in the United States, diabetes of all types affect an estimated 8.3 percent of the U.S. population \u2014 some 25.8 million Americans \u2014 and cost U.S. taxpayers more than $200 billion annually.\nIn California alone, an estimated 4 million people (one out of every seven adults) have type 2 diabetes and millions more are at risk of developing it. These numbers are poised to explode in the next half century if more is not done to prevent diabetes.\nPrevious studies have shown that counseling and other lifestyle interventions are effective at preventing type 2 diabetes, but those interventions have generally been designed for clinical settings and include separate sessions with numerous health professionals. This makes them expensive and difficult to scale to large urban populations where diabetes interventions are needed the most.\nMany of this country\u2019s urban poor face thin health insurance coverage, low literacy, and low income, and a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. These disparities were apparent in the UCSF study. About half of the study population was composed of immigrants, and nearly a quarter had no health insurance.

{"text":"Cybercrime costs $388 billion dollars in annual losses globally and it affected almost 7 in 10 adults last year.\nThis week Norton is released the results of the Norton Cybercrime Report 2011, a study on the impact of cybercrime that included a survey of over 12,000 adults in 24 countries. This provides an important and accurate picture of the scope of cybercrime globally and the results are shocking! Every day of the past year, over 1 million online adults in 24 countries experienced cybercrime. This can also be broken down to 50,000 victims per hour, 820 victims per minute, or 14 victims every second. In just the last 12 months 44% of people have been a victim of cybercrime while only 15% have been a victim of physical crime in the same period.\nI regularly meet with law enforcement who are fighting cybercrime. The above statistics clearly illustrate the biggest challenge faced by law enforcement\u2014the enormous scope of the problem. With so many victims in many different countries, police can successfully stop one cybercriminal but still be left with thousands of more cases. The police do a great job trying to stop cybercrime but the problem requires significantly more resources than are currently being devoted to stop it.\nOnly 21% of people in the Norton study reported the cybercrime to law enforcement. This also creates a significant problem for police and prosecutors. Some prosecutors will only accept cases that exceed a certain amount of victims or high level of damages. US law allows federal prosecutors to combine multiple victims into a common case if the crime is linked. This is critical in many cybercrime cases where there may be a small number of victims who have lost a relatively small amount individually. However, failure to report cybercrime prevents law enforcement from effectively addressing the problem.\nFinally, the key message of this report is one of hope. Despite the really frightening statistics on the scale of cybercrime, cybercrime is still largely a preventable crime. Globally the three most common reported forms of cybercrime were viruses, online scams, and phishing attacks. All of these crimes are largely preventable by following good security practices and using updated security software. I have worked with crime victims in some capacity for over a decade now. Nobody wants to be a victim. The police are trying to help but it is an extremely rare cybercrime case in which a victim actually recovers their lost money . Time dealing with cybercrime is also lost forever. It is far better to use good security software and follow careful safety steps online that can greatly reduce the likelihood of becoming one of the 7 in 10 global cybercrime victims last year.","id":"<urn:uuid:671172b8-6b97-4e32-bfd9-76a9704816bf>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/community.norton.com\/t5\/Cybercrime-Frontline-Blog\/Cybercrime-A-Shocking-Picture-of-the-Problem\/bc-p\/689263","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9505082369,"token_count":523,"score":2.5625,"int_score":3}
{"text":"BINGE EATING DISORDER\n\"Signs and Symptoms\"\nTo date, there has been some degree of confusion as to what exactly the term \"binge eating\" really means. Although the professional community still has yet to define [or quantify] what constitutes a binge-eating episode, it's reasonable to assume the signs and symptoms listed below are a good barometer of what is characteristic binge eating. In many respects, Binge Eating Disorder [BED] is similar to Bulimia without the compensatory behaviors. In addition, the term compulsive overeating may be \"interchangeable\" with BED - although some compulsive overeaters have a pattern of eating constantly [\"grazing\"] rather than experiencing episodes of binge eating per se.\nSigns and symptoms Binge Eating \/ Compulsive Overeating [COE]\n- Preoccupation with food.\n- Rapid consumption of food in significant excess of nutritional need\n- Sneaking or hoarding food - even immediately after meals.\n- Feeling ashamed or fearful when confronted about the problem.\n- Excessive concern about weight and body shape.\n- Sense of \"losing control\" during binge episode.\n- Feeling lonely, depressed, worried, self preoccupied\n- Spending a great deal of time alone \/ social isolation\n- Alternating between binge eating and \"dieting\"\nTreating BED at Milestones\nAs with many other eating disorders, the characteristics of a binge eating disorder appear to mimic [inherent among] other dependencies or addictions - whether to a substance or set of behaviors. In fact, the most recent committee of the American Psychiatric Association \"officially\" included BED as a bona fide disorder [disease]. The link below lists the criteria for \"dependency\" and requires only three of the several criteria \"fit\" for a diagnosis of dependency [aka addiction] to be considered.\nThe program offered at Milestones is comprised of two primary components, making the treatment experience unique in comparison to other programs.\nThe first is the setting - utilizing apartment-style residences affording residential participants an opportunity to experience treatment in a \"real world\" environment. Participants grocery shop with our dietitian within the community, learn to prepare their own meals per the prescribed [meal] food \/ meal plan they have formulated with the dietitian, attend a full schedule of groups and individual therapies at our clinical campus [near the residential complex], attend local community support groups in the evenings, and visit with our physicians and clinical staff regularly throughout their stay. In effect, the experience is one of providing a supportive and structured setting without the restrictive elements of a \"hospital\" or institutional facility. A key element in providing the support necessary to begin recovery is remaining in the company of other participants during the initial phase of the treatment. This provides both a form of supervision and a deterrent from the behavior often associated with binge eating: namely eating in isolation or alone.\nSecondly, Milestones approaches treatment from a more \"holistic\" perspective. Doing so is best described by the acronym \"SERF\" - Spirituality, Exercise, Rest, and Food Plan.\nSpirituality need not equate with any religious or spiritual beliefs imposed on or by anyone. In fact, Spirituality at Milestones simply is left up to the individual to cultivate with his or her own working definition. For most, it is a belief in a \"higher power\" and still for others it may be a return to some of their original religious beliefs. For everyone, it is an individual journey.\nExercise is individualized and represents collaboration between the resident and clinical team. It is meant to be in the service of restoring and maintaining a healthy body rather than an \"intensive\" means of controlling body weight.\nRest is simply about finding the correct balance in recovery between work and play and narrowing the gap between an \"all or none\", \"feast or famine\" approach to daily living.\nThe food plan suggested by Milestones is a blend of structured eating and a combination of healthy, whole foods that are bought and prepared by PARTICIPANTS with the guidance and supervision of our dietitian and ancillary staff. In brief participants select their own preferences within the guidelines of their individual food plans. The guidelines require participants to abstain from \"junk foods\" and eliminate most highly processed [sugar and flour laden] food products as well as weigh and measure portions per their food plan while in residence.\nIt is important to mention most participants who seek treatment for most eating disorders may have a tendency to focus on \"trading in the binging and\/or \"purging\" to become better at restricting or \"losing weight\" and as such, it is important to understand the predisposition to replace one form of an eating disorder for another. Acknowledging this is helpful to maintaining the prescribed treatment plan both during and after the residential treatment experience. Body mass and subsequent weight loss will likely change as a result of abstaining from overeating and move in the direction [towards] of a healthy \"set point\" as an outcome of the recovery process.\nEach participant is assigned an individual therapist whom they meet with on a regular basis during their stay as well as attend groups and experiential therapies per the schedule In sum, the physical and emotional aspects of their eating disorder are addressed within these formats.","id":"<urn:uuid:26e14fdc-9941-4f09-a1d7-7e7a78349e4e>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/milestonesprogram.org\/binge-eating-treatment.php","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9583480954,"token_count":1097,"score":2.578125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"1854-89 THREE DOLLARS INDIAN HEAD\nIn 1853 the United States negotiated the \"Gadsden Purchase\"settlement of a boundary dispute with Mexico that resulted in the U.S. acquiring what would become the southern portions of Arizona and New Mexico for ten million dollars. The following year Commodore Matthew Perry embarked upon his famed expedition to re-open Japan to the Western world and establish trade. Spreading beyond its borders in many ways, a few years earlier the United States had joined the worldwide move to uniform postage rates and printed stamps when the Congressional Act of March 3, 1845 authorized the first U.S. postage stamps, and set the local prepaid letter rate at five cents. This set the stage for a close connection between postal and coinage history.\nExactly six years later, the postage rate was reduced to three cents when New York Senator Daniel S. Dickinson fathered legislation that simultaneously initiated coinage of the tiny silver three-cent piece as a public convenience. The large cents then in circulation were cumbersome and unpopular, and the new denomination was designed to facilitate the purchase of stamps without using the hated \"coppers.\"\nThis reasoning was carried a step further when the Mint Act of February 21, 1853 authorized a three-dollar gold coin. Congress and Mint Director Robert Maskell Patterson were convinced that the new coin would speed purchases of three-cent stamps by the sheet and of the silver three-cent coins in roll quantities. Unfortunately, at no time during the 35-year span of this denomination did public demand justify these hopes. Chief Engraver James Barton Longacre chose an \"Indian Princess\" for his obverse not a Native American profile, but actually a profile modeled after the Greco-Roman Venus Accroupie statue then in a Philadelphia museum. Longacre used this distinctive sharp-nosed profile on his gold dollar of 1849 and would employ it again on the Indian Head cent of 1859. On the three-dollar coin Liberty is wearing a feathered headdress of equal-sized plumes with a band bearing LIBERTY in raised letters. She's surrounded by the inscription UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Such a headdress dates back to the earliest known drawings of American Indians by French artist Jacques le Moyne du Morgue's sketches of the Florida Timucua tribe who lived near the tragic French colony of Fort Caroline in 1562. It was accepted by engravers and medalists of the day as the design shorthand for \"America.\"\nLongacre's reverse depicted a wreath of tobacco, wheat, corn and cotton with a plant at top bearing two conical seed masses. The original wax models of this wreath still exist on brass discs in a Midwestern collection and show how meticulous Longacre was in preparing his design. Encircled by the wreath is the denomination 3 DOLLARS and the date. There are two boldly different reverse types, the small DOLLARS appearing only in 1854 and the large DOLLARS on coins of 1855-89. Many dates show bold \"outlining\" of letters and devices, resembling a double strike but probably the result of excessive forcing of the design punches into the die steel, causing a hint of their sloping \"shoulders\" to appear as part of the coin's design. The high points of the obverse design that first show wear are the cheek and hair above the eye; on the reverse, check the bow knot and leaves.\nA total of just over 535,000 pieces were issued along with 2058 proofs. The first coins struck were the 15 proofs of 1854. Regular coinage began on May 1, and that first year saw 138,618 pieces struck at Philadelphia (no mintmark), 1,120 at Dahlonega (D), and 24,000 at New Orleans (O). These two branch mints would strike coins only in 1854. San Francisco produced the three-dollar denomination in 1855, 1856, and 1857, again in 1860, and apparently one final piece in 1870. Mintmarks are found below the wreath.\nEvery U.S. denomination boasts a number of major rarities. The three-dollar gold coinage of 1854-1889 is studded with so many low-mintage dates that the entire series may fairly be called rare. In mint state 1878 is the most common date, followed by the 1879, 1888, 1854 and 1889 issues. Every other date is very rare in high grade, particularly 1858, 1865, 1873 Closed 3 and all the San Francisco issues. Minuscule mintages were the rule in the later years. Proof coins prior to 1859 are extremely rare and more difficult to find than the proof-only issues of 1873 Open 3, 1875 and 1876, but many dates are even rarer in the higher Mint State grades. This is because at least some proofs were saved by well- heeled collectors while few lower-budget collectors showed any interest in higher-grade business strikes of later-date gold. Counterfeits are known for many dates; any suspicious piece should be authenticated.\nThe rarest date of all is the unique 1870-S, of which only one example was struck for inclusion in the new Mint's cornerstone. Either the coin escaped, or a second was struck as a pocket piece for San Francisco Mint Coiner J.B. Harmstead. In any event, one coin showing traces of jewelry use surfaced in the numismatic market in 1907. It was sold to prominent collector William H. Woodin, and when Thomas L. Elder sold the Woodin collection in 1911, the coin went to Baltimore's Waldo C. Newcomer. Later owned by Virgil Brand, it was next sold by Ted and Carl Brandts of Ohio's Celina Coin Co. and Stack's of New York to Louis C. Eliasberg in 1946 for $11,500. In Bowers and Merena's October 1982 sale of the U.S. Gold Collection, this famous coin sold for a record $687,500.\nThe three-dollar denomination quietly expired in 1889 along with the gold dollar and nickel three-cent piece. America's coinage was certainly more prosaic without this odd denomination gold piece, but its future popularity with collectors would vastly outstrip the lukewarm public reception it enjoyed during its circulating life.","id":"<urn:uuid:ce5e0d75-e5f8-4ce2-8b94-86d9527d0dd4>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.coinsite.com\/CoinSite-PF\/PParticles\/$3goldix.asp","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9638387561,"token_count":1295,"score":3.671875,"int_score":4}
{"text":"Emmanuel, count de las CasesArticle Free Pass\nEmmanuel, count de las Cases, in full Emmanuel-augustin-dieudonn\u00e9-joseph, Count De Las Cases (born June 21, 1766, Languedoc, France\u2014died May 15, 1842, Passy), French historian best known as the recorder of Napoleon\u2019s last conversations on St. Helena, the publication of which contributed greatly to the Napoleonic legend in Europe.\nAn officer of the royal navy, Las Cases in 1790 emigrated from France to England, where he wrote and published his Atlas Historique . . . (1802), a work that attracted Napoleon\u2019s attention. Consequently, on his return to France (1809) with other Royalists rallying to Napoleon, Las Cases was given a minor position on the council of state and created count in 1810. After Napoleon\u2019s defeat (1814), he returned to England but joined Napoleon during the Hundred Days (1815), following him into exile at St. Helena. For 18 months he recorded his conversations with Napoleon on his principles of warfare, his identification of the French Revolution with the Empire, his political philosophy, and his sentiments on religion and philosophy. A letter of complaint about Napoleon\u2019s treatment led to Las Cases\u2019 deportation and to the seizure of his manuscript by the British government. Forbidden to enter England, he traveled in Germany and Belgium until he was allowed to return to France after the death of Napoleon in 1822. Recovering his manuscript, he published his M\u00e9morial de Sainte-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne (1823), which at once became extremely popular. A deputy for Saint-Denis (1831\u201334; 1835\u201339), he sat with the extreme left, opposing the rule of Louis-Philippe.\nLas Cases\u2019 M\u00e9morial de Sainte-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne was the first defense of Napoleon after his defeat. Although prejudiced in Napoleon\u2019s favour, the identification of the idea of the Revolution with Napoleon furthered a union of liberals with Bonapartists, thus contributing to the rise of Napoleon III.\nWhat made you want to look up \"Emmanuel, count de las Cases\"?

{"text":"File compression is to perform some algorithm on the file that reduces it in size but the reverse of the algorithm will return it to its original form. In data files, the compression and decompression must be lossless which means that the data must be returned to its exact form. There are various methods to do this: some hardware implementations and some software. The most popular ones that are implemented in hardware usually use a Limpel-Ziv algorithm to look for repeating sequences over a set span of data (the run) and replace that with special identifying information. Compression does save space but may take extra time (latency).\nVideo and music data are typically already compressed. The compression rates are usually very high because of the data and the fact that a lossy compression algorithm is used. It can be lossy (meaning that all bits may not be decompressed exactly) because it won't be noticeable with video or music.\nZip files are the result of software compression.

{"text":"The Weekly Newsmagazine of Science\nVolume 155, Number 19 (May 8, 1999)\n|<<Back to Contents|\nBy J. Raloff\nCanadian scientists have identified the likely culprit behind some historic, regional declines in Atlantic salmon. The researchers find that a near-ubiquitous water pollutant can render young, migrating fish unable to survive a life at sea.\nHeavy, late-spring spraying of forests with a pesticide laced with nonylphenol during the 1970s and '80s was the clue that led the biologists to unmask that chemical's role in the transitory decline of salmon in East Canada. Though these sprays have ended, concentrations of nonylphenols in forest runoff then were comparable to those in the effluent of some pulp mills, industrial facilities, and sewage-treatment plants today. Downstream of such areas, the scientists argue, salmon and other migratory fish may still be at risk.\nNonylphenols are surfactants used in products from pesticides to dishwashing detergents, cosmetics, plastics, and spermicides. Because waste-treatment plants don't remove nonylphenols well, these chemicals can build up in downstream waters (SN: 1\/8\/94, p. 24).\nWhen British studies linked ambient nonylphenol pollution to reproductive problems in fish (SN: 2\/26\/94, p. 142), Wayne L. Fairchild of Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans in Moncton, New Brunswick, became concerned. He recalled that an insecticide used on local forests for more than a decade had contained large amounts of nonylphenols. They helped aminocarb, the oily active ingredient in Matacil 1.8D, dissolve in water for easier spraying.\nRunoff of the pesticide during rains loaded the spawning and nursery waters of Atlantic salmon with nonylphenols. Moreover, this aerial spraying had tended to coincide with the final stages of smoltificationthe fish's transformation for life at sea.\nTo probe for effects of forest spraying, Fairchild and his colleagues surveyed more than a decade of river-by-river data on fish. They overlaid these numbers with archival data on local aerial spraying with Matacil 1.8D or either of two nonylphenol-free pesticides. One contained the same active ingredient, aminocarb, as Matacil 1.8D does.\nMost of the lowest adult salmon counts between 1973 and 1990 occurred in rivers where smolts would earlier have encountered runoff of Matacil 1.8D, Fairchild's group found. In 9 of 19 cases of Matacil 1.8D spraying for which they had good data, salmon returns were lower than they were within the 5 years earlier and 5 years later, they report in the May Environmental Health Perspectives. No population declines were associated with the other two pesticides.\nThe researchers have now exposed smolts in the laboratory to various nonylphenol concentrations, including some typical of Canadian rivers during the 1970s. The fish remained healthyuntil they entered salt water, at which point they exhibited a failure-to-thrive syndrome.\n\"They looked like they were starving,\" Fairchild told Science News. Within 2 months, he notes, 20 to 30 percent died. Untreated smolts adjusted normally to salt water and fattened up.\nSteffen S. Madsen, a fish ecophysiologist at Odense University in Denmark, is not surprised, based on his own experiments.\nTo move from fresh water to the sea, a fish must undergo major hormonal changes that adapt it for pumping out excess salt. A female preparing to spawn in fresh water must undergo the opposite change. Since estrogen triggers her adaptation, Madsen and a colleague decided to test how smolts would respond to estrogen or nonylphenol, an estrogen mimic.\nIn the lab, they periodically injected salmon smolts with estrogen or nonylphenol over 30 days, and at various points placed them in seawater for 24 hours. Salt in the fish's blood skyrocketed during the day-long trials, unlike salt in untreated smolts. \"Our preliminary evidence indicates that natural and environ- mental estrogens screw up the pituitary,\" Madsen says. The gland responds by making prolactin, a hormone that drives freshwater adaptation.\nJudging by Fairchild's data, Madsen now suspects that any fish that migrates between fresh and salt water may be similarly vulnerable to high concentrations of pollutants that mimic estrogen.\nFrom Science News, Vol. 155, No. 19, May 8, 1999, p. 293.

{"text":"In 1962 President John F. Kennedy\u2019s administration narrowly averted possible nuclear war with the USSR, when CIA operatives spotted Soviet surface-to-surface missiles in Cuba, after a six-week gap in intelligence-gathering flights.\nIn their forthcoming book Blind over Cuba: The Photo Gap and the Missile Crisis, co-authors David Barrett and Max Holland make the case that the affair was a close call stemming directly from a decision made in a climate of deep distrust between key administration officials and the intelligence community.\nUsing recently declassified documents, secondary materials, and interviews with several key participants, the authors weave a story of intra-agency conflict, suspicion, and discord that undermined intelligence-gathering, adversely affected internal postmortems conducted after the crisis peaked, and resulted in keeping Congress and the public in the dark about what really happened.\nWe asked Barrett, a professor of political science at Villanova University, to discuss the actual series of events and what might have happened had the CIA not detected Soviet missiles on Cuba.\nThe Actual Sequence of Events . . .\n\u201cSome months after the Cuban Missile Crisis, an angry member of the Armed Services Committee of the House of Representatives criticized leaders of the Kennedy administration for having let weeks go by in September and early October 1962, without detecting Soviet construction of missile sites in Cuba. It was an intelligence failure as serious as the U.S. ignorance that preceded the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, he said.\nSecretary of Defense Robert McNamara aggressively denied that there had been an American intelligence failure or ineptitude with regard to Cuba in late summer 1962. McNamara and others persuaded most observers the administration\u2019s performance in the lead-up to the Crisis had been almost flawless, but the legislator was right: The CIA had not sent a U-2 spy aircraft over western Cuba for about a six week period.\nThere were varying reasons for this, but the most important was that the Kennedy administration did not wish to have a U-2 \u201cincident.\u201d Sending that aircraft over Cuba raised the possibility that Soviet surface-to-air missiles might shoot one down. Since it was arguably against international law for the U.S. to send spy aircrafts over another country, should one be shot down, there would probably be the same sort of uproar as happened in May 1960, when the Soviet Union shot down an American U-2 flying over its territory.\nFurthermore, most State Department and CIA authorities did not believe that the USSR would put nuclear-armed missiles into Cuba that could strike the U.S. Therefore, the CIA was told, in effect, not even to request permission to send U-2s over western Cuba. This, at a time when there were growing numbers of reports from Cuban exiles and other sources about suspicious Soviet equipment being brought into the country.As we now know, the Soviets WERE constructing missile sites on what CIA deputy director Richard Helms would call \u201cthe business end of Cuba,\u201d i.e., the western end, in the summer\/autumn of 1962. Fortunately, by mid-October, the CIA\u2019s director, John McCone, succeeded in persuading President John F. Kennedy to authorize one U-2 flight over that part of Cuba and so it was that Agency representatives could authoritatively inform JFK on October 16th that the construction was underway.The CIA had faced White House and State Department resistance for many weeks about this U-2 matter.\"\nWhat Could Have Happened . . .\n\u201cWhat if McCone had not succeeded in persuading the President that the U.S. needed to step up aerial surveillance of Cuba in mid-October? What if a few more weeks had passed without that crucial October 14 U-2 flight and its definitive photography of Soviet missile site construction?\nRemember to check out Blind over Cuba: The Photo Gap and the Missile Crisis, which is being published this fall!If McCone had been told \u201cno\u201d in the second week of October, perhaps it would have taken more human intelligence, trickling in from Cuba, about such Soviet activity before the President would have approved a risky U-2 flight.The problem JFK would have faced then is that there would have been a significant number of operational medium-range missile launch sites. Those nuclear-equipped missiles could have hit the southern part of the U.S. Meanwhile, the Soviets would also have progressed further in construction of intermediate missile sites; such missiles could have hit most of the continental United States.If JFK had not learned about Soviet nuclear-armed missiles until, say, November 1st, what would the U.S. have done?There is no definitive answer to that question, but I think it\u2019s fair to say that the President would have been under enormous pressure to authorize\u2014quickly--a huge U.S. air strike against Cuba, followed by an American invasion. One thing which discovery of the missile sites in mid-October gave JFK was some time to negotiate effectively with the Soviet Union during the \u201cThirteen Days\u201d of the crisis. I don\u2019t think there would have been such a luxury if numerous operational missiles were discovered a couple weeks later.No wonder President Kennedy felt great admiration and gratitude toward those at the CIA (with its photo interpreters) and the Air Force (which piloted the key U-2 flight). The intelligence he received on October 16th was invaluable. I think he knew that if that intelligence had not come until some weeks later, there would have been a much greater chance of nuclear war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.\u201d","id":"<urn:uuid:7da5e687-07e2-4c8f-9fac-fe3f58c7017a>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/tamupress.blogspot.com\/2012\/07\/close-call-what-if-cia-had-not-spotted.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9771577716,"token_count":1150,"score":2.828125,"int_score":3}

{"text":"By Karen Kaplan\n5:53 PM EST, January 30, 2013\nAttention dieters: Many of the \u201cfacts\u201d you think you know about obesity and weight loss are wrong.\nSo says a report published in Thursday\u2019s edition of the New England Journal of Medicine. An international team of dietitians, doctors and other experts examined more than a dozen ideas about obesity that are widely believed to be true but aren\u2019t actually supported by reliable medical evidence. It\u2019s not just dieters who buy into these mistaken notions, the study authors note \u2013 much of this incorrect conventional wisdom is espoused by physicians, academic scientists, government agencies and (gulp) the media.\nSeven of these errant ideas were classified as \u201cmyths,\u201d meaning they are \u201cbeliefs held to be true despite substantial refuting evidence.\u201d Another six were categorized as \u201cpresumptions,\u201d or \u201cbeliefs held to be true for which convincing evidence does not yet confirm or disprove their truth.\u201d\nWithout further ado, let\u2019s get to the myth-busting:\nEating a little less or exercising a little more will lead to large weight loss over time, as long as those behaviors are sustained. This myth is based on the idea that 3,500 calories are equal to one pound. That equation was based on short-term experiments. In the long-term, the body compensates in various ways that slow down weight loss. For instance, the equation predicts that a person who burns 100 extra calories per day will lose more than 50 pounds over five years; in reality, that exercise regimen will cause a person to shed only about 10 pounds (assuming calorie intake remains the same).\nIt\u2019s important to set realistic weight-loss goals so dieters don\u2019t get frustrated. Studies that have examined this reasonable-sounding assumption have found that having realistic goals has no impact on the amount of weight lost. Indeed, some studies have found that those who set the most ambitious goals lost the most weight, even if they fell short of their initial expectations.\nSlow, gradual weight loss is easier to sustain than large, rapid weight loss. In fact, clinical trials have found that people who jump-start their diets by dropping a lot of weight in the beginning (by consuming only 800 to 1,200 calories per day, for instance) had the best results in long-term studies.\nIn order to help someone lose weight, you must gauge their readiness to stick to a diet. Experimental evidence shows that readiness isn\u2019t related to diet results.\nSchool P.E. classes help reduce and prevent childhood obesity. While there is certainly some amount of physical education that would help fight childhood obesity, P.E. classes in their current form have not been shown to reduce BMI or obesity in kids on a consistent basis.\nBabies who are breast-fed are less likely to become obese. If you think this is true, you\u2019re in good company \u2013 the World Health Organization presented this \u201cfact\u201d in one of its reports. But a randomized, controlled clinical trial that followed 13,000 children for more than six years found \u201cno compelling evidence\u201d that breastfeeding staves off obesity, according to the New England Journal of Medicine report. (The authors did note that breastfeeding has other benefits and should be encouraged anyway.)\nYou can burn 100 to 300 calories by having sex.

{"text":"LANs to WANs(c) The Complete Management Guide\nAuthors: Muller N.J.\nPublished year: 2003\n|< Day Day Up >|\nDepending on the situation facing network managers, bridges can be used to either extend or segment LANs. At one level, bridges can be used for segmenting LANs into smaller subnets to improve performance, control access, and facilitate fault isolation and testing without impacting the overall user population. At another level, they are used to create an extended network that greatly expands the number of devices that can be supported and the services available to each user . Bridges may even offer additional features such as data compression, which has the effect of providing greater throughput over low-speed lines. Compression ratios of 2:1 all the way down to 6:1 may be selected by the network manager, depending on what the vendor offers with a specific product.\nAs noted, bridging occurs at the data link layer (see Figure 5.1), which provides physical addressing, manages access to the physical medium, controls data flow, and handles transmission errors. Bridges analyze incoming frames, make forwarding decisions based on the source and destination addresses of those frames, and then forward the frames to their destinations. Sometimes, as in source-route bridging, the frame contains the entire path to the destination. In other cases, as in transparent bridging, frames are forwarded one hop at a time toward the destination.\nFigure 5.1: Bridge functionality in reference to the OSI model.\nBridges can be either local or remote. Local bridges provide direct connections between many LAN segments in the same area. Remote bridges connect LAN segments in different areas, usually over telecommunication lines. There are several kinds of bridging and all may be supported in the same device:\nTransparent bridging \u2014used mostly in Ethernet environments that have the same media types, these bridges keep a table of destination addresses and outbound interfaces.\nSource-route bridging \u2014used mostly in token-ring environments, these bridges only forward frames based on the routing indicator contained in the frame. End stations are responsible for determining and maintaining the table of destination addresses and routing indicators.\nTranslation bridging \u2014used to bridge data between different media types, these devices typically go between Ethernet and FDDI or token ring to Ethernet.\nSource-route translation bridging \u2014this is a combination of source-route bridging and transparent bridging that allows communication in mixed Ethernet and token-ring environments. (Translation bridging without routing indicators between token ring and Ethernet is also called source-route transparent bridging.)\nThe engine for transparent bridging is the spanning tree algorithm (STA), which dynamically discovers a loop-free subset of the network\u2019s topology. The STA accomplishes this by placing active bridge ports that create loops into a standby or blocked condition. A blocked port can provide redundancy in that if the primary port fails, it can be activated to take the traffic load.\nThe spanning tree calculation is triggered when the bridge is powered up and whenever a change in topology is detected . A topology change might occur when a forwarding port is going down (blocking) or when a port transitions to forwarding and the bridge has a designated port, which also indicates that the bridge is not standalone. Configuration messages known as bridge protocol data units (BPDUs) actually trigger the spanning tree calculation. These messages are exchanged between bridges at regular intervals set by the network manager, usually 1 to 4 seconds.\nOnce a change in topology is detected, this information must be shared with all bridges on the network. This is a two-step process that starts when a bridge notifies the root bridge of the spanning tree by sending it a special BPDU known as a topology change notification (TCN). The bridge sends the TCN out over its root port. The root bridge acknowledges the message by sending back a normal configuration BPDU with the topology change acknowledgment (TCA) bit set. The second step in the topology update process entails the root bridge sending out configuration BPDUs with the topology change (TC) bit set. These BPDUs are relayed by every bridge, so they can become aware of the changed topology.\nThere are some problems associated with spanning tree. The more hosts on the network, the higher the probability of topology changes. For example, a directly attached host, such as a client or server, will trigger a topology change when powered off, then go on to clear an operating system problem. In a large, flat network, the point can be reached when it is continually in topology change status. The resulting high level of flooding can lead to an unstable STP environment. To deal with this problem, vendors have come up with ways to avoid TCN generation for certain events. For example, the network manager can configure the bridge so that it issues a TCN when a server is power cycled, but not when client devices are power cycled. If a bridge port going up or down is not deemed an important event, this event too can be programmed not to issue a TCN.\nSource-route bridging (SRB) is used in the token-ring environment as the method by which a station establishes a route through a multiple-ring network to its destination. The first step for a station to reach another is to create a packet called an explorer. This packet is copied by all bridges in the network, with each of them adding information about itself before passing it on. The explorer packet\u2019s routing information field (RIF) contains the information of where it has traversed through the network and within the RIF; a route descriptor stores the path it has taken through the network.\nAs the explorer packet is constructed on its way through the network, the destination station will start receiving data packets from the originating station. Based on the contents of the explorer packet, the destination station will then decide which route to use to send data packets back to the originating station. Or it will send its own explorer packet so that the originating station can determine its own route.\nThe explorer packet is limited in terms of how many rings it can hold in the routing information field. Although the RIF can hold a total of 14 rings, IBM long ago limited this to seven. Other vendors also adopted this limitation. Consequently, an explorer packet that has traversed seven rings will be dropped in the network. To control traffic in the network with more precision, parameters can be set in the bridge to decrease this number even further, so that packets that reach X number of rings (any number below seven) will be dropped.\nWhile explorers are limited to traversing only seven rings, in a meshed ring environment, one explorer can finish being copied by many bridges, which can cause too many explorers. Explorer storms can be prevented in redundant network topologies by setting the bridge to filter out explorers that have already been forwarded once. Since explorer traffic can be distinguished from regular source route traffic, the network manager can issue commands that check the bridge for various parameters, such as the number of explorers that were dropped outbound on that interface.\nWhile Ethernet has become the network of choice for new installations, there is still a good amount of token ring in use, making it necessary to mix the two environments for data exchange. Doing so is complicated because some very fundamental differences between Ethernet and token ring must be reconciled. Token ring has functional addresses, while Ethernet primarily relies on broadcasts.\nFurthermore, MAC addresses on the Ethernet are different from MAC addresses on the token ring. Ethernet does not have a source-route bridging capability and token ring has a routing information field. Finally, token ring and Ethernet use different methods to read the bits into their adapters.\nTo unify the two environments, vendors have come up with various methods such as translation bridging. This is a type of bridging that is implemented on networks that use different MAC sublayer protocols, providing a method of resolving differences in header formats and protocol specifications. Since there are no real standards in how communication between two media types should occur, however, no single translation implementation can be called correct. The only consideration for network managers is to select a method of translation and implement it uniformly throughout the network.\nEssentially, the bridges reorder source and destination address bits when translating between Ethernet and token-ring frame formats. The problem of embedded MAC-addresses can be resolved by programming the bridge to look for various types of MAC addresses. Some translation-bridges simply check for the most popular embedded addresses. If others are used, the bridge must be programmed to look for them as well. But if translation-bridging software runs in a multi-protocol router, which is very common today, these protocols can be routed and the problem avoided entirely.\nToken ring\u2019s RIF field has a component that indicates the largest frame size that can be accepted by a particular source-route bridging implementation. Translation bridges that send frames from the transparent-bridging domain to the SRB domain usually set the maximum transfer unit (MTU) field to 1,500 bytes to limit the size of token-ring frames entering the transparent-bridging domain, because this is the maximum size of Ethernet frames. Some hosts cannot process this field correctly, in which case translation bridges are forced to drop the frames that exceed Ethernet\u2019s MTU size.\nBits representing token-ring functions that are absent in Ethernet are discarded by translation bridges. For example, token ring\u2019s priority, reservation, and monitor bits are discarded during translation. And token ring\u2019s frame status bits are treated differently, depending on the bridge manufacturer; the products of some manufacturers may even ignore these bits.\nSometimes, the bridge will have the C bit set, indicating that the frame has been copied, but not the A bit set, indicating that the destination station recognizes the address. In the former case, a token-ring source node determines if the frame it sent has become lost. Advocates of this approach claim that reliability mechanisms, such as the tracking of lost frames, are better left for implementation in Layer 4 of the OSI model. Advocates of setting the C bit argue that this bit must be set to track lost frames, but that the A bit cannot be set because the bridge is not the final destination.\nTranslation bridges also can be used to create a software gateway between the token ring and Ethernet domains. To the SRB end stations, the translation bridge has a ring number and a bridge number associated with it, so it looks like a standard source-route bridge. In this case, the ring number reflects the entire transparent-bridging domain. To the transparent-bridging domain, the translation bridge is just another transparent bridge.\nWhen bridging from the SRB domain to the transparent-bridging domain, SRB information is removed. Token ring\u2019s routing information fields usually are cached for use by any subsequent return traffic. When bridging from the transparent bridging to the SRB domain, the translation bridge checks the frame to see if it has a multicast or unicast destination. If the frame has a multicast or broadcast destination, it is sent into the SRB domain as a spanning-tree explorer. If the frame has a unicast address, the translation bridge looks up the destination in the RIF cache. If a path is found, it is used and the RIF information is added to the frame; otherwise , the frame is sent as a spanning-tree explorer.\nAnother solution to unify the Ethernet and token-ring environments is source-route translation bridging (SRTLB). This entails the addition of bridge groups to the interfaces of both the token ring and Ethernet bridges to create a transparent bridge domain between the two environments. The bridges at each end are responsible for establishing the path through the network. When a bridge on a token ring receives a packet from an Ethernet, for example, path establishment is handled as follows (see Figure 5.2):\nFigure 5.2: Source-route translation bridging, from token ring to Ethernet.\nBridge-1 receives a packet from the Ethernet. This is from PC-1 to the host.\nBridge-1 needs a RIF to reach the host, so it creates an explorer to learn the path to reach the host.\nAfter Bridge-1 receives the response, it sends the response (without a RIF) to the Ethernet station.\nPC-1 sends an exchange identifier (XID) to the host MAC address.\nBridge-1 gets the Ethernet packet, attaches the RIF to the host, and sends the packet on its way.\nAs far as the host is concerned , the Ethernet is sitting on a pseudo ring. This is configured with the source-bridge transparent command on the bridge. The pseudo ring makes the host treat the Ethernet as if it were a token ring.\n|< Day Day Up >|\nLANs to WANs(c) The Complete Management Guide\nAuthors: Muller N.J.\nPublished year: 2003","id":"<urn:uuid:e16b4240-d208-4ee2-8272-ce223fa2146e>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/flylib.com\/books\/en\/4.62.1.44\/1\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9224795103,"token_count":2669,"score":3.359375,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Too many of our young people are caught up in conflicts every day that they do not know how to manage -- teasing, jealousy, and physical aggression. Juvenile delinquency and violence are symptoms of youth's inability to manage conflict in their lives. Teaching youth how to manage conflict in a productive way can help reduce incidents of violent behavior. Conflict resolution education is a beneficial component of a comprehensive violence prevention and intervention program in schools and communities.\nConflict resolution education encompasses problem solving in which the parties in dispute express their points of view, voice their interests, and find mutually acceptable solutions. Conflict resolution education programs help the parties recognize that while conflict happens all the time, people can learn new skills to deal with conflict in nonviolent ways. The programs that appear to be most effective are comprehensive and involve multiple components such as the problem-solving processes and principles of conflict resolution, the basics of effective communication and listening, critical and creative thinking, and an emphasis on personal responsibility and self-discipline.\nEffective conflict resolution education programs can:\nFour Common Strategies for Approaching Conflict Resolution\nExperts identify four school-based conflict resolution strategies that can be replicated in other settings. These are commonly referred to as: (1) Peer Mediation, (2) Process Curriculum, (3) Peaceable Classrooms, and (4) Peaceable Schools. In all four approaches, conflict resolution education is viewed as giving youth nonviolent tools to deal with daily conflicts that can lead to self-destructive and violent behaviors. It is up to each local school district to decide how conflict resolution education will be integrated into its overall educational environment. The expectation is that when youth learn to recognize and constructively address what takes place before conflict or differences lead to violence, the incidence and intensity of that situation will diminish.\nThe program examples provided below empower young people with the processes and skills of conflict resolution. However, youth need to know that conflict resolution does not take precedence over adult responsibility to provide the final word in a variety of circumstances or situations. Conflict resolution has a place in the home, school, and community, but it can only supplement, not supplant, adult authority.\n1) Peer Mediation Approach\nRecognizing the importance of directly involving youth in conflict resolution, many schools and communities are using the Peer Mediation approach. Under this approach, specially trained student mediators work with their peers to resolve conflicts. Mediation programs reduce the use of traditional disciplinary actions such as suspension, detention, and expulsion; encourage effective problem solving; decrease the need for teacher involvement in student conflicts; and improve school climate.\nAn example of a Peer Mediation program is We Can Work It Out, developed by the National Institute for Citizenship Education in the Law and the National Crime Prevention Council. The program promotes mediation, negotiation, or other non-litigating methods as strategies to settle unresolved confrontations and fighting.\nOne Albuquerque elementary school principal reported, \"We were having 100 to 150 fights every month on the playground before we started the New Mexico Center for Dispute Resolution's Mediation in the Schools Program. By the end of the school year, we were having maybe 10 (fights).\" Other elementary schools using the same Peer Mediation approach to conflict resolution education reported that playground fighting had been reduced to such an extent that peer mediators found themselves out of a job.\nProcess Curriculum Approach\nTeachers who devote a specific time -- a separate course, a distinct curriculum, or a daily lesson -- to the principles, foundation abilities, and problem-solving processes of conflict resolution are implementing the Process Curriculum approach. The Program for Young Negotiators, based on the Harvard Negotiation Project, is representative of this approach. Participating students, teachers, and administrators are taught how to use principled negotiation to achieve goals and resolve disputes. This type of negotiation helps disputants envision scenarios and generate options for achieving results that satisfy both sides.\nIn a North Carolina middle school with more than 700 students, conflict resolution education was initiated. The school used the Peace Foundation's Fighting Fair curriculum and a combination of components from various conflict resolution projects. After a school year, in-school suspensions decreased from 52 to 30 incidents (a 42-percent decrease), and out-of-school suspensions decreased from 40 incidents to 1 (a 97-percent decrease).\nPeaceable Classroom Approach\nThe Peaceable Classroom approach integrates conflict resolution into the curriculum and daily management of the classroom. It uses the instructional methods of cooperative learning and \"academic controversy.\" The Educators for Social Responsibility curriculum, Making Choices About Conflict, Security, and Peacemaking, is a peaceable classroom approach to conflict resolution. The program shows teachers how to integrate conflict resolution into the curriculum, classroom management, and discipline practices. It emphasizes opportunities to practice cooperation, appreciation of diversity, and caring and effective communication. Generally, peaceable classrooms are initiated on a teacher-by-teacher basis into the classroom setting and are the building blocks of the peaceable school.\nStudies on the effectiveness of the Teaching Students To Be Peacemakers program, a Peaceable Classroom approach to conflict resolution, show that discipline problems requiring teacher management decreased by approximately 80 percent and referrals to the principal were reduced to zero.\nPeaceable School Approach\nThe Peaceable School approach incorporates the above three approaches. This approach seeks to create schools where conflict resolution has been adopted by every member of the school community, from the crossing guard to the classroom teacher. A peaceable school promotes a climate that challenges youth and adults to believe and act on the understanding that a diverse, nonviolent society is a realistic goal.\nIn creating the Peaceable School Program of the Illinois Institute for Dispute Resolution, students are empowered with conflict resolution skills and strategies to regulate and control their own behavior. Conflict resolution is infused into the way business is conducted at the school between students, between students and teachers and other personnel, between teachers and administrators, and between parents and teachers and administrators.\nIn an evaluation of the Resolving Conflict Creatively Program in four multiethnic school districts in New York City, teachers of the Peaceable School approach to conflict resolution reported a 71-percent decrease in physical violence in the classroom and observed 66 percent less name calling and fewer verbal insults. Other changes in student behavior reported by the teachers included greater acceptance of differences, increased awareness and articulation of feelings, and a spontaneous use of conflict resolution skills throughout the school day in a variety of academic and nonacademic settings.\nThe effective conflict resolution education programs highlighted above have helped to improve the climate in school, community and juvenile justice settings by reducing the number of disruptive and violent acts in these settings; by decreasing the number of chronic school absences due to a fear of violence; by reducing the number of disciplinary referrals and suspensions; by increasing academic instruction during the school day; and by increasing the self-esteem and self-respect, as well as the personal responsibility and self-discipline of the young people involved in these programs.\nYoung people cannot be expected to promote and encourage the peaceful resolution of conflicts if they do not see conflict resolution principles and strategies being modeled by adults in all areas of their lives, such as in business, sports, entertainment, and personal relationships. Adults play a part in making the environment more peaceful by practicing nonviolent conflict resolution when minor or major disputes arise in their daily lives.\n(Information provided by the U.S. Department of Education.)","id":"<urn:uuid:2117d9f1-3399-4b6a-929c-55e15ad30135>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.myfoxphoenix.com\/story\/371955\/teaching-conflict-resolution","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9500727057,"token_count":1506,"score":3.921875,"int_score":4}

{"text":"Courtesy Iona Knapp\nIona Knapp, right, has been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, a potential precursor to Alzheimer's disease. Like 1 in 7 people with Alzheimer's or other dementias, the 65-year-old Lake Monticello, Va., woman lives alone. Her daughter, Sharon Mullen, lives 90 minutes away, in Manassas.\nIona Knapp\u2019s father died of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and her late mother suffered from dementia. Now, the 65-year-old Lake Monticello, Va., woman has been diagnosed herself with mild cognitive impairment, or MCI, and she fears their fate soon may be her own.\nThe trouble is, Knapp lives by herself, which would make her one of 5.4 million people in the U.S. living with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other dementias -- and one of 800,000 Americans doing it alone, according to a new report issued Thursday by the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.\nThe report, \u201c2012 Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Facts and Figures,\u201d estimates that one in seven people with Alzheimer's or dementia lives alone, and that up to half of those people have no identifiable caregiver. Most are older women with milder impairment.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a huge issue,\u201d said Dr. Kenneth Langa, professor of medicine at the University of Michigan, and an expert on the economics and demographics of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease.\nAs the baby boom generation ages, more and more people diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s will be living alone, sometimes because they choose to do so, but also because a spouse has died, or because they have few or no children living nearby, said Langa, who wasn\u2019t involved in the new report.\nThe analysis finds that Alzheimer\u2019s costs the country about $200 billion per year in Medicare, Medicaid, and personal out-of-pocket expenses. As enormous as that cost is, it takes 15.2 million unpaid caregivers, usually family members, to keep it from rising even higher.\nThe personal impact on living alone with Alzheimer\u2019s, dementia, or even MCI like Knapp\u2019s, can be dramatic compared to living with a caregiver. Patients who live alone have a much higher risk of wandering off, suffering bad falls, missing medication and doctor appointments, and exacerbating other medical conditions like heart disease or diabetes. Ultimately that\u2019s not only harmful to those people, but it ratchets up costs, too.\nAs Knapp herself discovered when she served as an unpaid caregiver to her mother, living alone has a host of practical costs and dangers.\nWhen she accompanied her mother to the bank one day, \u201cthe teller said, \u2018Your mother is way overdrawn. She has no money,\u2019\u201d Knapp recalled. \u201cI looked back over the past two years of records, and found my mother had bankrupted herself.\u201d\nNow, she said, \u201cI imagine my own future. I meet with my attorney on Friday. I want to talk to him about all kinds of things I can put in place so my older daughter can step in and take over financially.\u201d\nSuch advanced planning is critical for anybody with Alzheimer\u2019s, but especially for those who live alone, said Angela Geiger, chief strategy officer for the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.\nLegal and logistical considerations like advanced directives, power of attorney designations, and answers about who will be part of the care team must be addressed. None of these decisions is pleasant, Geiger explained, but they must be addressed.\n\u201cYou really want to say, \u2018Here are the two or three triggers for me. I\u2019d like to go to assisted living as soon as possible,\u2019 or, \u2018Do I want to stay in my house as long as possible?' 'Who pays my bills?\u2019\u201d\nWhile Knapp wrestles with those decisions, she\u2019s trying to adapt so she can continue to live by herself, independently, for as long as possible. But it\u2019s a challenge. She writes reminders on a white board. She programs appointments into her smart phone.\nSuch tactics aren\u2019t foolproof, though: This week, she missed a doctor\u2019s appointment.\nKnapp is considering the purchase of an alarm button she can wear to alert emergency services in case she finds herself injured or lost. She\u2019s also thinking of selling her house, and moving into senior housing close to her daughter, Sharon Mullen, whose family lives in Manassas, Va. Transportation will be available there, she hopes, because she\u2019s already growing worried about her own driving. \u201cThere are times now, when I\u2019ll be, like, \u2018Where am I going?\u2019\u201d\nThe Alzheimer\u2019s Association has created an online social network called ALZ Connected, in an effort to provide support, especially for those who find it tough to get out for in-person group support meetings.\nAccording to Langa, barring some miracle of science -- and the science of Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia has been frustrating so far -- the population of Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia sufferers is going to grow significantly over the next decade. And because of America\u2019s changing demographics, more and more of those people will be living alone.\n\u201cTo me that is one of the key issues going forward, from a public policy standpoint,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat will the care-giving resources be?\u201d\nDo you live alone? Do you worry about what you'll do if you have health issues?

{"text":"Why Man U?\nAskMen \/ Getty Images\n\"Gathering together at Old Trafford must have given these people something of the sense of community that they had previously known in their villages.\"\nVisiting Manchester the other day, I was driving down a nondescript road past dreary shops and offices when I saw the top of a sports stadium poking into the gray sky. It was Old Trafford. Team buses carrying soccer players from more glamorous cities such as Barcelona have been known to echo with cries of disgust as they pull in here.\nThe home of Manchester United is rainy and underwhelming. The estimated 333 million humans who consider themselves United fans don\u2019t all know that Manchester is a city in England, but many of those who do would probably be surprised to find just how mid-ranking a city it is. Yet when United\u2019s American ruling family, the Glazers, sold club shares in August, United was valued at $2.3 billion. That made it the world\u2019s most valuable sports franchise, ahead of Real Madrid and baseball\u2019s New York Yankees, according to Forbes. In short, United is bigger than Manchester. So why on earth did this global behemoth arise precisely here? And how, in the last 134 years, has United shaped soccer, in England and now the world?\nWhen a soccer club was created just by the newish railway line in 1878, the Manchester location actually helped. The city was then growing like no other on earth. In 1800 it had been a tranquil little place of 84,000 inhabitants, so insignificant that as late as 1832 it didn\u2019t have a member of parliament. The Industrial Revolution changed everything. Workers poured in from English villages, from Ireland, from feeble economies everywhere (my own great-grandparents arrived on the boat from Lithuania). By 1900, Manchester was Europe\u2019s sixth-biggest city, with 1.25 million inhabitants.\nThe club by the railway line was initially called Newton Heath, because the players worked at the Newton Heath carriage works of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company. They played in work clogs against other work teams. Jim White\u2019s Manchester United: The Biography nicely describes the L&YR workers as \u201csucked in from all over the country to service the growing need for locomotives and carriages.\u201d Life in Manchester then was neither fun nor healthy, White writes. In some neighborhoods, average male life expectancy was just 17. This was still the same brutal city where a few decades before, Karl Marx\u2019s pal Friedrich Engels had run his father\u2019s factory. The conditions of the industrial city were so awful it inspired communism. (My own great-grandparents lost two of their children to scarlet fever in Manchester before moving on to much healthier southern Africa.)\nInevitably, most of these desperate early Mancunians were rootless migrants. Unmoored in their new home, many embraced the local soccer clubs. Gathering together at Old Trafford must have given these people something of the sense of community that they had previously known in their villages. That\u2019s how the world\u2019s first great industrial city engendered the world\u2019s greatest soccer brand.

{"text":"With a deer, you would never grab the bull by the horns.\nFor a few good reasons: Male deer are not called bulls, they are bucks, and they do not have horns, only antlers. Antlers and horns are two distinctly different accessories.\nHorns are hollow and are held atop the head of members of the bovid family. Bovids include cows, sheep, bison and goats. Horns grow continuously year-round and are covered in keratin. They do not usually branch and are found on both male and female bovids.\nAntlers, on the other hand, are temporary bones found on the heads of members of the cervid family. Cervids include deer, moose, elk, caribou and others. Antlers are temporary, often branching structures, growing generally on males for only part of the year. After eight months of growth and development, antlers will drop off the animal\u2019s head. These cranial appendages are covered with a soft skin called velvet, which supplies blood, oxygen and nutrients to the growing antler bone. It is this velvet that will be rubbed against trees during mating, or rutting season in December.\nIt is not only form, but function that is different for these two toppers. Horns mainly protect the skull, while antlers are for communicating, to establish dominance, and for seducing members of the opposite sex. Seduction is accomplished by the antlers because the velvet covering and the animal\u2019s head contain the highest concentration of oil and scent-producing glands that will attract the fairer sex.\nSize matters when it comes to antlers. Bigger is better \u2014 a nice rack can be up to nine pounds and spread to 25 inches wide! The ladies, or does, will notice a sizable rack, which is the result of a combination of factors, including good nutrition, age and genetics. Bucks are headstrong and will challenge each other, engaging in shoving matches to impress the girls and dissuade the competition.\nIt is interesting to imagine the growth process of antlers, which start as nubs, grow to substantial size, and then fall off. Spring starts the antler growth cycle again. In April, longer days stimulate a buck\u2019s hormones and his antlers will begin to develop. Antlers are the fastest growing bone known to science, increasing up to a half an inch per day. Contrast this with human hair, which takes a month to grown that same half inch. Antlers will grow until early fall, then the bone will die and the velvet dries up and falls or is rubbed off. Finally, the antlers will be dropped or shed.\nNow is the time for \u201cshed,\u201d or antler hunting, a sport that requires no weapon. On-Island, of the cervids, one only finds deer so one only finds deer antlers, and only if you are lucky. Mid-December through mid-February is the time to look for shed antlers. Don\u2019t be surprised if you don\u2019t find any. Antlers, no matter how large, disappear quickly. They are speedily consumed by rodents, rabbits, squirrels and other animals that crave their high calcium and phosphorus and have the right incisor teeth to chew the tough bone. If you are fortunate and find an antler, look for teeth marks and evidence of nibbles.\nAntler\u2019s hard bone has been used for needles, weapons, arrowheads and even harpoons. In the 18th century, French naturalist Georges Louis Leclerc de Buffon hypothesized that antlers were made of vegetable matter or wood, which caused his doubters to raise questions about how antlers were attached to the deer\u2019s head. Luckily, French zoologist Georges Cuvier ascertained their true nature a few years later.\nAntler shape varies from animal to animal. They can be categorized as typical or nontypical and can have tines or points. Typical antlers are symmetrical and shoot up evenly from a beam, while a nontypical antler is asymmetrical with points or tines shooting out at different angles.\nAntlers are a victory of form and strength, though they are heavy to haul around and cumbersome to carry. And while the well-endowed buck will likely get the girl, he will also have to contend with the ever present possibility that with his colossal crown, he could end up a terrific trophy.\nSuzan Bellincampi is director of the Felix Neck Wildlife Sanctuary in Edgartown.","id":"<urn:uuid:733b14f4-a209-493e-a69a-c2d84d6ccfc5>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.mvgazette.com\/news\/2011\/02\/03\/hard-knocks","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.963563621,"token_count":943,"score":3.015625,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Influenza, or \u201cthe flu,\u201d is a contagious viral infection of the nose, throat, and lungs which occurs most often in the late fall, winter, and early spring. Flu is a serious infection which is associated, on average, with more than 200,000 hospitalizations due to flu related complications and can lead to thousands of deaths every year in the United States.\n\u201cNo one wants to spread the flu to family, friends, or colleagues. Yet many of us admit to tossing our manners aside when we have the flu,\u201d said Anna Post, great-great-granddaughter of Emily Post and co-author of the 18th edition of Emily Post\u2019s Etiquette. \u201cKnowing how to politely cancel an event you\u2019re hosting or how to avoid shaking your client\u2019s hand because you\u2019re sick can help avoid a potentially difficult and awkward situation. By following appropriate flu etiquette, we can all play a role in preventing the spread of the flu virus.\u201d\nThe Emily Post Institute offers the following etiquette tips to manage common situations where the flu virus might be spread from one person to another:\n1. Share space, not the flu \u2013 Covering sneezes and coughs is a good habit all year round, especially during flu season. The flu virus can spread up to six feet away from coughing, sneezing, or even just talking.\n2. Know when to take a sick day \u2013 The flu is highly contagious and the people you work with don\u2019t want to get sick. Knowing the symptoms of flu versus a cold is important so you know when to take a sick day and see a doctor. Remember the acronym F.A.C.T.S. to recognize if you might have the flu (Fever, Aches, Chills, Tiredness with Sudden Onset).\n3. In tight quarters \u2013 It\u2019s tough to point out someone\u2019s behavior mid-flight with hours left to go. However, flu is highly contagious. If there\u2019s no other seat available, consider saying, \u201cI can see you\u2019re not feeling well\u2014would you mind covering your mouth when you cough? Thanks.\u201d Most people when prompted are eager to show good manners and do the right thing.\n\u201cEvery year, millions of Americans get influenza. We are all personally responsible for helping to control its spread,\u201d says Susan J. Rehm, MD, medical director at the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID). \u201cThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends flu vaccine as the first and most important step in preventing influenza, as well as good hygiene. If symptoms arise, see a doctor quickly. The flu can be treated with prescription antiviral medicines.\u201d\nTo help children recognize flu symptoms, learn good habits, and pass the time with a fun activity this winter, download a free coloring book at FluFACTS.com.

The volatile memories are used like Random Access Memories (RAM) due to its low access time and unlimited number of Read\/Write cycles. On the other hand, the Non-volatile memories (NAND, SD) stores for long periods of time the required information to operate the Embedded System.\nUniversal Serial Bus (USB) is a way of setting up communication between a computer and peripheral devices. USB is intended to replace many varieties of serial and parallel ports. USB can connect computer peripherals such as mice, keyboards, PDAs, gamepads and joysticks, scanners, digital cameras, printers, personal media players, flash drives, and external hard drives. For many of those devices, USB has become the standard connection method.\nA USB system has an asymmetric design, consisting of a host, a multitude of downstream USB ports, and multiple peripheral devices connected in a tiered-star topology. Additional USB hubs may be included in the tiers, allowing branching into a tree structure with up to five tier levels. A USB host may have multiple host controllers and each host controller may provide one or more USB ports.

{"text":"|About the presenter: Patricia M. Roberts, Ph.D., CCC-SLP, SLP(C), currently Associate Professor in speech language pathology at the University of Ottawa, in Canada's capital. She holds degrees from Queen's University (Kingston, Canada) and Florida State University and obtained her Ph.D. from the Universite de Montreal.In her first career as a clinical SLP, she worked with many bilingual clients and was privileged to have the late Marie Poulos as colleague and mentor. She is spending much of her 2nd career as a professor and researcher trying to understand the many unsolved puzzles of bilingual stuttering.|\nIn this presentation, I will focus on four mysteries (things we do not yet know) about stuttering in bilingual children and adults and some of the myths associated with these gaps in our current knowledge.\nTo make this essay easier to read, I won't say \"bilingual or multilingual\" each time the word \"bilingual\" comes up but in most places, what applies to bilinguals also applies to multilingual speakers - as far as we know - so far.\nMystery 1: How many bilingual people are there?\nIt is sometimes confusing to even try to discuss bilingualism because the word bilingual means different things to different people. For some people, bilinguals are people who speak two (or more - for multilinguals) languages equally and perfectly. People who speak two languages in their daily lives, and can do most things such as talking to people at work, reading the newspaper, understanding conversations with friends sometimes say \"Oh yes, I can do all that. But I am not bilingual\". Other people describe themselves as bilingual if they can communicate basic ideas, even if they make many errors in grammar and pronunciation and have a very small vocabulary in one language.\nIn research, both these kinds of people are seen as having different levels of bilingualism. Ratings from 1 to 7 or 1 to 9 are often used to estimate where each person falls along the continuous line that goes from \"I really ONLY know one language\" to \"I am one of those rare people who feels equally at home in two languages, no matter what the task or topic\". For speaking, hearing, reading, and writing, most of us are at slightly different levels of ability, in each of the languages we know.\nFor this essay - and the discussions I hope it will spark - let's think of bilingualism as being a continuum. We don't divide the world into tall people and short people. There is no rational cut-off to separate \"tall\" from \"short\". Same thing for \"bilingual\" and \"unilingual\". Everyone is at some point along the line that goes from strongly unilingual to very, very bilingual.\nWith a broad definition of bilingualism, some authors estimate that there are at least as many people in the world who need to use two or more languages in their daily lives as there are people who can only function in one language (see, for example, Bhatia & Ritchie, 2006). We cannot make precise estimates unless we first define what levels of bilingualism are included or excluded from the count (and where to divide dialects from languages).\nMystery 2: Is the incidence of stuttering the same in different languages?\nThere are studies of the incidence of stuttering in different countries. Some authors use these studies to say things like \"the incidence of stuttering is higher in Country X than in Country Y\". But, if each study used different ways of sampling and different ways of determining who stutters, it is not valid to compare across studies. For example, from one study to the next, different methods were used in deciding who is stuttering: parent reports? Teachers in schools or day care centres? Parents remembering what the child was like 5 or 10 years ago? There are also differences in what counts as stuttering: only for a few months at age 3? Only people who stuttered for more than a year? Only those who reach a given level of severity?\nWhen people see these reports, they often speculate about why the incidence figures SEEM to be different (ignoring the differences in how the estimates were reached), often using their favourite aspect of stuttering as the explanation. Thus, we see explanations like:\n1) \"There is more stuttering in Country X than in Country Y because the grammar of the language spoken in Country X makes greater demands on memory....\" The complexity of a language might be relevant, in some subtle ways including the location of moments of stuttering within a sentence. Concluding that the language itself influences the number of people who stutter requires a huge, dangerous leap of logic. There are other possible explanations that have to be ruled out before we can select one of them and reject the others.\n2) \"There is more stuttering in ___ because that culture views speaking well as very important and the pressure to speak well makes people stutter\". This explanation now seems very unlikely, given what we know about the causes of stuttering.\nNow that we understand the importance of genetics and the inherited nature of stuttering for many people, it seems logical to ask whether, in some ethnic groups, more people carry the genes that make them vulnerable to stuttering than is the case in other ethnic groups. Perhaps the genetic pool, not cultural or linguistic features, has the strongest influence on the incidence of stuttering. Or, more likely, perhaps several causal factors contribute, interacting with each others in ways we do not yet understand.\nThe only way we will ever know if the incidence of stuttering varies across languages or countries is to do international, collaborative studies where the same rigourous methods are used in everywhere THEN we can propose explanations for the similar or differing rates of stuttering in different languages and\/or countries.\nMystery 3: Does speaking more than one language increase the risk of a child stuttering?\nMany people think it does. For the general public, it seems logical. Sometimes people reason this way: 1) Speaking two languages is hard. 2) For children who stutter, speaking is hard. 3) Therefore, children who stutter (or those who are at risk of developing stuttering, because of a known family history) should not be expected to learn two languages.\nIn the research on stuttering, the Demands and Capacities model of stuttering seems to apply here. But is it \"hard\" to learn two languages or is this a myth? If learning two languages as a young child is neurologically or cognitively strenuous, why is it that tens of millions of children do so successfully? Are their brains slightly stressed if they have to sort out two languages during the best language-learning years in childhood? Most of the research on bilingualism says \"no\". However, bilingualism is seen as something very positive by most people who do research on it, and most studies are designed to detect advantages and not problems associated with bilingualism. Also, this research is based on children with no speech or language problems. In children with a genetic vulnerability to stuttering, is learning two sets of words and grammar rules, and two sets of speech sounds harder than it is for children without this vulnerability? If learning two languages as a child is much harder than learning one, is it all potentially bilingual children or only a sub-group of those who might be at risk for stuttering?\nHow should we interpret the recent and somewhat controversial study by Howell, Davis and Williams (2009) that found a higher incidence of stuttering in children if they began learning English (the language of their new country? before age 5? Were there other reasons for the finding that children who learned English before starting school were more likely to stutter than those who reportedly began learning English when they began school in London, England? (See Packman, et al, 2009 letter to the editor and Howell et al.'s reply.)\nThere are four other, older studies that have led some people to conclude that bilingualism is too great a strain for children who stutter. In each case, these studies have serious flaws that make it impossible to draw any conclusions from them. Travis, Johnson and Shover (1937) asked people with no training in communication disorders (such as priests and steel company personnel directors) to talk to young children and classify them as stuttering or not stuttering based on one interview. Stern (1948) interviewed children if their parents reported that they stuttered. In both these studies, we have little information about the type of speech sample obtained, how long it was or how the disfluencies were counted. Applying current standards to these studies, they would not be accepted for publication.\nDale (1977) reported that four Cuban-American teenagers reported feeling that being made to speak their weaker language made them more disfluent. Most bilinguals have a stronger and a weaker language. For these teens, their first language - Spanish - was their weaker language, since so much of their lives at school and with friends took place in English, their second language. This study \"blames\" bilingualism. But we have no information about real disfluency rates across different situations, and Dale does not distinguish between normal disfluencies and tense, stuttered disfluencies. There are studies showing that, in adults, the memory load of speaking in their weaker language may lead to a higher number of normal disfluencies (ums, uh's, revisions) in the weaker language than in the preferred language (e.g., Fehringer & Fry, 2007). Perhaps that is all that was happening in this study. Dale offers no data to support the notion that any of the four adolescents, in fact, stuttered.\nKarniol (1992) described how stuttering appeared to increase and decrease in a young boy whose environment included exposure to various levels of English, Hebrew, and Hungarian during an extremely tense time that included a war going on around him. With the information provided, we cannot tell what his real level of exposure to each language was (siblings, friends, parents etc.) and whether his parents' attempts to expose him to only Hebrew had any impact on what is described as a recovery from stuttering. The parents' diaries cover a period of approximately one year (age 2 to age 3) when the boy was in the age group where the chances of spontaneous recovery from stuttering are very, very high.\nThere is (still) no clinical research to support the strategy of removing one language from a child's environment. Recent reviews of the literature do not find support for doing this routinely for all children (e.g., Bernstein Ratner, 2004; Roberts & Shenker, 2007; Van Borsel, Maes & Foulon, 2001). Some clinicians do this, however, if they work in a Demands and Capacities framework OR if the child also has delayed language and\/or problems learning the speech sounds of his\/her language. Until there is solid evidence on the impact of bilingualism in young children (i.e. a series of studies, done by different authors, ideally on different types of speakers and different pairs of languages), each clinician is left to try a particular strategy and assess its impact on a case by case basis.\nMystery 4: Do some bilingual people stutter in only one language?\nAs of 2010, I am still not aware of any documented case of this occurring. Like the Loch Ness monster, there are reported sightings from time to time, but no real proof that this is possible. In my years working with bilingual adults who stutter, I never assessed or treated a case of \"unilingual stuttering\". (Note: if you know of someone who stutters in only one of their two (or more) languages, I would be interested in exploring this with you. Just because there are no documented cases does not mean that it never occurs !)\nNonetheless, given the roles of genetics and motor processes in stuttering, it is highly unlikely that someone would stutter in only one of their languages. Van Riper (1971) cites second- and third-hand reports of two people reported to stutter in only one of their two languages, but offers no data. Howell, Davis and Williams (2009) report that 2 of the 38 children in their bilingual group stuttered in only one language, but there is no supporting data about the rates of disfluencies, or the level of proficiency in each language and the children were not assessed using a range of speaking tasks.\nRoberts and Shenker (2007, Table 1) outlined the steps that would be required to show that someone with a working knowledge of two languages stutters in only one language. Sometimes, when someone appears to stutter in only one language it could be for one or more of the following reasons:\nThere are more and more studies about stuttering in different languages and some studies (and soon, a new book edited by Howell and Van Borsel) that focus specifically on stuttering in bilingual speakers. This is a very welcome change. Ten or fifteen years ago, there was little awareness that bilingual stuttering was a topic that needed exploring. Perhaps in a future ISAD forum, there will be articles about the answers to the questions raised in this one.\nBernstein Ratner, N. (2004). Fluency and stuttering in bilingual children.

One of the best ways to help children learn math is to present them with a problem in which they have to devise their own strategies to find the solution(s).

If as you say: \"All the letters of the Hebrew Alphabet are contained in the letter Bet\", why is it that the modern form of its shape is different from its ancient form? I would think that the original forms of the Hebrew letters would be where design would be found if it were there.

For starters let me just say this: There is no linguist in the world that can confidently tell anyone where language or written writing originally came from. They cannot truly tell you that so and so writing came before so and so writing. All they can do is surmise. Now, I will tell you from lengthy study that ALL written writing compiled from every known alphabet (even Chinese) can all be linked to the Hebrew block style of writing that first appeared when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the 10 commandments. We can see similarity in these letters even to cuneiform which is said to be the oldest.\nSo what I estimate happened was that Adam and Eve originally spoke this language, and the 7th generation from them which was Enoch (who was recorded in his book as well as the book of Jubilees and additionally the Dead Sea Scrolls) who was the FIRST SCRIBE of written writing which was shown to him by G-d\u00eds appointed angel 'Uriel'. Enoch calls these 'ketav einayim' (eye writings).\nNow through the centuries these letters became mottled and distorted (but we can still see the similarities).

{"text":"While any kind of dog can attack, some breeds are more prone to attacks than others. In fact, some dogs are more likely than others to kill humans.\nThe Centers of Disease Control estimates that more than 4.7 million people are bitten by dogs every year. Of those, 20 percent require medical attention.\nIn a 15-year study (1979-1994) a total of 239 deaths were reported as a result of injuries from dog attacks in the United States. Through its research, the CDC compiled a list of the dogs most responsible for human fatalities. They are as follows:\nThe study found that most dog-bite-related deaths happened to children. But, according to the CDC there are steps children (and adults) can take cut down the risk of a dog attack from family pets as well as dogs they are not familiar with:\n-Don't approach an unfamiliar dog.\n-If an unfamiliar dog approaches you, stay motionless.\n-Don't run from a dog or scream.\n-If a dog knocks you down, roll into a ball and stay still.\n-Avoid looking directly into a dog's eyes.\n-Leave a dog alone that is sleeping, eating or taking care of puppies.\n-Let a dog see and sniff you before petting it.\n-Don't play with a dog unless there is an adult present.\n-If a dog bites you, tell an adult immediately.\nBut, the CDC's report says most attacks are preventable in three ways:\n1. \"Owner and public education. Dog owners, through proper selection, socialization, training, care, and treatment of a dog, can reduce the likelihood of owning a dog that will eventually bite. Male and unspayed\/unneutered dogs are more likely to bite than are female and spayed\/neutered dogs.\"\n2. \"Animal control at the community level. Animal-control programs should be supported, and laws for regulating dangerous or vicious dogs should be promulgated and enforced vigorously. For example, in this report, 30% of dog-bite-related deaths resulted from groups of owned dogs that were free roaming off the owner's property.\"\n3. \"Bite reporting. Evaluation of prevention efforts requires improved surveillance for dog bites. Dog bites should be reported as required by local or state ordinances, and reports of such incidents should include information about the circumstances of the bite; ownership, breed, sex, age, spay\/neuter status, and history of prior aggression of the animal; and the nature of restraint before the bite incident.\"\nCDC officials did make one important note about its list: The reporting of the breed was subjective. There is no way to determine if the identification of the breed was correct. Also, there is no way to verify if the dog was a purebred or a mixed breed.\nCopyright 2011 Scripps Media, Inc.

{"text":"W hy is it important for scientists to contribute to science education?\nOur nation has failed to meet important educational challenges, and our children are ill prepared to respond to the demands of today?s world. Results of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study ( TIMSS )--and its successor, TIMSS-R--show that the relatively strong international performance of U.S. 4th graders successively deteriorates across 8th- and 12th-grade cohorts. Related studies indicate that U.S. PreK-12 curricula lack coherence, depth, and continuity and cover too many topics superficially. By high school, unacceptably low numbers of students show motivation or interest in enrolling in physics (only one-quarter of all students) or chemistry (only one-half).\nWe are rapidly approaching universal participation at the postsecondary level, but we still have critical science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce needs and too few teachers who have studied science or mathematics. Science and engineering degrees as a percentage of the degrees conferred each year have remained relatively constant at about 5%. In this group, women and minorities are gravely underrepresented.\nThe consequences of these conditions are serious. The U.S. Department of Labor estimates that 60% of the new jobs being created in our economy today will require technological literacy, yet only 22% of the young people entering the job market now actually possess those skills. By 2010, all jobs will require some form of technological literacy, and 80% of those jobs haven?t even been created yet. We must prepare our students for a world that we ourselves cannot completely anticipate. This will require the active involvement of scientists and engineers.\nHow is NSF seeking to encourage scientists to work on educational issues?\nThe NSF Strategic Plan  includes two relevant goals: to develop \"a diverse, internationally competitive, and globally engaged workforce of scientists, engineers, and well-prepared citizens\" and to support \"discovery across the frontiers of science and engineering, connected to learning, innovation, and service to society.\" To realize both of these goals, our nation?s scientists and engineers must care about the educational implications of their work and explore educational issues as seriously and knowledgeably as they do their research questions. The phrase \"integration of research and education\" conveys two ideas. First, good research generates an educational asset, and we must effectively use that asset. Second, we need to encourage more scientists and engineers to pursue research careers that focus on teaching and learning within their own disciplines.\nAll proposals submitted to NSF for funding must address two merit criteria: intellectual merit and broader impacts.\nIn everyday terms, our approach to evaluating the broader impact of proposals is built on the philosophy that scientists and engineers should pay attention to teaching and value it, and that their institutions should recognize, support, and reward faculty, as well as researchers in government and industry, who take their role as educators seriously and approach instruction as a scholarly act. We think of education very broadly, including formal education (K-graduate and postdoctoral study) and informal education (efforts to promote public understanding of science and research outside the traditional educational environment).\nWhat does it mean to take education seriously and explore it knowledgeably?\nAny scholarly approach to education must be intentional, be based on a valid body of knowledge, and be rigorously assessed. That is, our approach to educational questions must be a scholarly act. NSF actively invests in educational reform and models that encourage scientists and engineers to improve curriculum, teaching, and learning in science and mathematics at all levels of the educational system from elementary school to graduate study and postdoctoral work.\nWe recognize that to interest faculty and practicing scientists and engineers in education, we must support research that generates convincing evidence that changing how we approach the teaching of science and mathematics will pay off in better learning and deeper interest in these fields.\nHere are a few of the most recent efforts to stimulate interest in education that might be of interest to Next Wave readers. (For more information, go to the NSF Education and Human Resources directorate's Web site .)\nThe GK-12  program supports fellowships and training to enable STEM graduate students and advanced undergraduates to serve in K-12 schools as resources in STEM content and applications. Outcomes include improved communication and teaching skills for the Fellows, increased content knowledge for preK-12 teachers, enriched preK-12 student learning, and stronger partnerships between higher education and local schools.\nThe Centers for Learning and Teaching ( CLT ) program is a \"comprehensive, research-based effort that addresses critical issues and national needs of the STEM instructional workforce across the entire spectrum of formal and informal education.\" The goal of the CLT program is to support the development of new approaches to the assessment of learning, research on learning within the disciplines, the design and development of effective curricular materials, and research-based approaches to instruction--and through this work to increase the number of people who do research on education in the STEM fields. This year (FY 02) we are launching some prototype higher education centers to reform teaching and learning in our nation's colleges and universities through a mix of research, faculty development and exploration of instructional practices that can promote learning. Like other NSF efforts, the Centers incorporate a balanced strategy of attention to people, ideas and tools. We hope to encourage more science and engineering faculty to work on educational issues in both K-12 and in postsecondary education.\nIf you are interested in these issues and want to pursue graduate or postdoctoral study, or want to develop a research agenda on learning in STEM fields, find the location and goals of the currently funded centers and also check later this summer to find out which higher education CLT prototypes are funded.\nThe following solicitations all involve the integration of research and education as well as attention to broadening participation in STEM careers:\nThe Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Talent Expansion Program ( STEP ) program seeks to increase the number of students (U.S. citizens or permanent residents) pursuing and receiving associate or baccalaureate degrees in established or emerging fields within STEM.\nThe Faculty Early Career Development ( CAREER ) program recognizes and supports the early career development activities of those teacher-scholars who are most likely to become the academic leaders of the 21st century.\nThe Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory Improvement (CCLI) program seeks to improve the quality of STEM education for all students and targets activities affecting learning environments, course content, curricula, and educational practices. CCLI offers three tracks: educational materials development , national dissemination , and adaptation and implementation .\nThe Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training ( IGERT ) program addresses the challenges of preparing Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the multidisciplinary backgrounds and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future.\nThe Vertical Integration of Research and Education in the Mathematical Sciences ( VIGRE ) program supports institutions with Ph.D.-granting departments in the mathematical sciences in carrying out innovative educational programs, at all levels, that are integrated with the department?s research activities.\nThe Increasing the Participation and Advancement of Women in Academic Science and Engineering Careers (ADVANCE)  program seeks to increase the participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the increased representation and advancement of women in academic science and engineering careers.\nThe Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Teacher Preparation ( STEMTP ) program involves partnerships among STEM and education faculty working with preK-12 schools to develop exemplary preK-12 teacher education models that will improve the science and mathematics preparation of future teachers.\nThe Noyce Scholarship Supplements  program supports scholarships and stipends for STEM majors and STEM professionals seeking to become preK-12 teachers.\nThe views expressed are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the National Science Foundation.","id":"<urn:uuid:21bc3a09-e45d-497b-add1-4880324aff25>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/sciencecareers.sciencemag.org\/print\/career_magazine\/previous_issues\/articles\/2002_07_12\/nodoi.4298361476632626608","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.950221777,"token_count":1620,"score":3.03125,"int_score":3}

{"text":"When it comes to solar power, the real dilemmas are efficiency and cost. On the one hand, efficiency has steadily improved over the last couple decades to the point where it\u2019s approaching the utility prices of other power generation methods. Exotic technologies promise even greater gains. However, the price of solar-generated power still remains at least five times as expensive as coal-power, the chief source of power in the U.S. (compared to the leading candidate, nuclear, which is approximately 1.5 to 2 times as expensive).\nWhile solar adoption from a cost standpoint is unattractive, there's much debate over whether commercial adoption is needed to spur further research to propel solar into the realm of cost competitiveness. While many nations like the U.S. and China have modestly taken this position, adopting solar at a moderate rate, one nation has fallen head over heels for solar -- Spain.\nSpain is allowing solar and wind power plants to charge as much as 10 times the rates of coal power plants, making it possible for solar power installations to earn utilities big money. On average, recent rate increases have raised solar charges to over 7 times the rates of coal or natural gas rates. The costs are added onto consumers' power bills.\nThe results are mixed; while Spanish power bills are at record highs, the number of deployments is soaring. Spain has 14 GW of solar power, or the equivalent capacity of nine average nuclear reactors, under construction -- the most of any nation. Florida\u2019s FPL Group Inc. and French Electricite de France SA are among the many jumping to build in Spain.\nGabriel Calzada, an economist and professor at Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid, states, \"Who wouldn\u2019t want to enter a business that\u2019s paid many times more than the market rate, and where the customer is guaranteed for life?\"\nBy 2009, 42 percent of Spaniards energy bills -- approximately 95 euros ($127) on average -- will be provided by alternative energy. Spanish law requires power distributors to buy all clean energy produced in the first 25 years of the plants' lives. The government also recently raised the rate of Spain believes this sacrifice will pay off as fossil fuel resources become depleted and emissions standards tighten.\nKarsten von Blumenthal, an industrial analyst at Hamburg-based SES Research GmbH states, \"The guarantee is more attractive than what other countries offer. Actually the U.S. has better space for solar, in the deserts of California and Nevada.\"\nThe U.S. meanwhile is also advancing thanks in part to President Obama's solar initiatives passed earlier this year as part of the federal stimulus legislation. Over 6 GW of capacity is planned for the U.S.\nFred Morse, an official at the Washington- based Solar Energy Industries Association trade group and author of the first report to the White House on solar power (1969), says that the U.S. needs to adopt more incentives if it hopes to catch Spain. He states, \"The incentives, if implemented promptly and effectively, should greatly facilitate the financing of these plants.\"\nOne promising benefit of the Spanish solar boom is that it is increasing the number of plants utilizing new, potentially more efficient technologies like solar thermal or sterling engines. Spain is limiting the number of photovoltaic plants (solar panel-based designs), but is giving out unlimited licenses for solar thermal and other alternative plants.\nquote: 1 - Solar Tech is improving very quickly.

{"text":"The Jersey breed originated over 600 years ago on the Island of Jersey, located in the English Channel between France and England. Today, outstanding herds of Jerseys can be found from Denmark to New Zealand, from Canada to South America, and from South Africa to Japan.\nThe first Jerseys to be registered by the American Jersey Cattle Association were imported to the United States in 1850, but cattle from Jersey Island had been imported to this country much earlier. Today, there are almost 400,000 Jersey cows in the United States and they are an important part of the dairy industry in all 50 states. California has the most Jersey cows, followed by Wisconsin, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Ohio.\nJersey calves weigh about 55 pounds at birth. Mature Jersey females usually weigh about 950 pounds and males about 1,500 pounds. Jerseys reach maturity the earliest of all dairy breeds and are efficient reproducers. They also have the longest productive life, or longevity in the milking herd, of any dairy breed. Jerseys are more tolerant of heat than the larger breeds, and are adapted to a wide range of climatic and geographical conditions.\nJersey milk has a rich, smooth flavor because it naturally contains higher percentages of protein, calcium, and other important nutrients than milk from other dairy breeds (for the latest milk test results, click here). The extra protein is the reason Jersey milk yields the greatest amount of cheddar cheese: 12.35 pounds of cheese from 100 pounds of milk. This compares to the yield of average milk produced in the United States of 10.04 pounds of cheese.\nThe Jersey is the most efficient dairy producer in the world, producing more pounds of milk per pound of body weight than any other breed. An average Jersey in the United States produces 16 times her bodyweight in milk each year, or about twice her body weight in Cheddar cheese. The Jersey production champion produced over 40 times her body weight in one year: 49,250 lbs. of milk containing 1,645 lbs. of protein. That is equal to 70,752 half-pint servings of milk, enough milk for an entire year's lunches in a school of 400 students.\nThe American Jersey Cattle Association was organized in 1868 to improve and promote the breed of Jersey cattle in the United States. It is located at 6486 East Main Street in Reynoldsburg, Ohio 43068. For more information, subscribe to the Jersey Journal or log onto the AJCA's website at www.USJersey.com.

{"text":"12. June 2012 10:55\nRetinal hemorrhage occurs when the blood vessels in the retina get damaged or ruptured, leading to abnormal bleeding. The retina, which is composed of rods and cones is the region of the eye responsible for sensitivity to light, and vision. The retinal vein and artery, along with a dense network of capillaries, are responsible for transmitting the blood supply to the retina. When these blood vessels are damaged, due to any reason, this affects the blood supply to the retina, which in turn leads to a decrease in visual acuity. Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in people aged between 20 and 65.\nThe dense network of cells in the retina is extremely sensitive, and can be damaged with even a slight trauma.\nThe causes due to which this damage might occur include:\n- High blood pressure\n- Forceful blows in the head region\n- Child abuse in infants\n- Improper development of blood vessels in infants born prematurely\n- Blurred vision\n- Spotted vision\n- Lines in the field of vision\n- Blind spots\n- Distorted vision\n- Progressive vision loss\n- The disease is diagnosed by an ophthalmologist, who uses an opthalmoscope to examine the internal structure of the eye.\n- Another method that is commonly used to detect the abnormalities in the blood vessels is a fluorescein angiography test, in which a fluorescent dye is injected into the patient\u2019s bloodstream, after which photographs are clicked to view the blood vessels.\n- In some cases, the physician might also order for a blood test to be performed.\n- The disorder is self-limiting in most patients, with more than 85% cases healing on their own.\n- The most common treatment for retinal hemorrhages is laser treatment, in which a laser beam is used to remove the affected blood vessels.\n- If the disease is caused by some underlying medical condition like diabetes or hypertension, the treatment focuses on eliminating that disorder.\n- Injection of anti-VEGF drugs like Avestin has been found to be effective in the treatment of hemorrhages associated with the growth of new vessels.\n- The administration of various nutritional and herbal supplements like antioxidants, omega-3-rich foods, antioxidant vitamins, zinc, lutein, pine bark extract, grape seed extract, etc. has also been found to be effective in improving the symptoms of the disease.\nWe at Killeen Eyecare center are renowned throughout Killeen for providing the highest quality eye care to all our patients.

{"text":"In preparation for Christmas, I read Stephen Nissenbaum's 1998 \"The Battle for Christmas,\" a thorough exploration of this season.\nThe book's title will be deceiving, because it has nothing to do with the recent sacred-vs.-secular Christmas quarrels. Nissenbaum explores the myriad ways that Christmas has evolved in our nation. It turns out we've been jockeying for more than 300 years over what this holiday means.\nIn Colonial America our faith-filled ancestors banned Christmas altogether, outlawing it in some colonies. Until the 1760s, one could not even find an almanac that would print the word \"Christmas\" on the date Dec. 25.\nThis opposition was because Christmas had become a drunken spectacle where gangs of poor young men roamed the streets, making merry and engaging in acts of petty rowdyism, vaguely like today's New Year's Eve. It was customary and permissible for these gangs to knock on doors of strangers to demand gifts. (\"So give us some figgy pudding....\")\nOur nation's first \"battle\" for Christmas was the movement to domesticate the holiday, a battle that Nissenbaum suggests involved merchants, the middle and upper classes and the church.\nMerchants began linking Christmas and the purchase of manufactured gifts as early as the 1830s as society began to stress family celebrations in front of a tree and with Santa visiting every home. In case you think that your complaining will reverse the commercialism of this holiday, according to Nissenbaum that complaint first emerged in the 1830s. Complain if you must, but don't expect results.\nNissenbaum so thoroughly explores Clement Moore's \"'Twas the Night before Christmas\" that one learns why Saint Nick touches the side of his nose and why his pipe is a short one. Nissenbaum contends that the ascendance of Santa Claus, the emergence of the Christmas tree and even the giving of gifts contribute to this gradual process of making Christmas a less revolutionary, more predictable holiday. He explores Dickens and Scrooge, Christmas parties for poor children and even the complicated master-slave relationship at Christmas leading up to and immediately following the Civil War.\nIf you prefer to maintain that Christmas was a pure season of private devotion and public worship until Sears, Roebuck, Wal-Mart and the Supreme Court got involved, don't read this book. Ditto if you enjoy lamenting that \"They've taken Christmas away from us,\" Nissenbaum might say that a pure, simple Christmas never existed. Rather it has evolved since the first day the Colonists set foot on our shore, an evolution showing no sign of abating.\nNissenbaum's scholarly, heavily footnoted book is enlightening and readable. But his analysis of Christmas reminds me of a scientist who thoroughly explains the rainbow but never grasps its beauty. And so as this season continues to evolve, I'll enjoy my Christmas tree, sing both \"White Christmas\" and \"Joy to the World,\" and be grateful again for the mystery of Bethlehem, which properly understood, is the most revolutionary act of history.\nContact columnist minister Creede Hinshaw at Wesley Monumental United Methodist Church in Savannah at email@example.com.","id":"<urn:uuid:fc291606-3625-4033-97fb-f0d3e531c2bc>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.albanyherald.com\/news\/2009\/dec\/11\/christmas-has-been-evolving-for-centuries\/?features","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9519102573,"token_count":669,"score":2.640625,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Ethiopian kids hack Zoom tablets in five months.\nThe One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) project recently tried a new approach to distributing computers to developing countries, by leaving boxes of tablets in remote Ethiopian villages with no instructions. The Motorola Zoom tablets had a custom English language OS, a solar charger, and tracking software to monitor how they were used.\nTo the surprise of the organization, not only could the kids who started using the tablets easily figure out how to switch on and use them, but they also learnt to hack into the OS and enable features - amazing especially seeing as most of the kids had never seen a printed word before, let alone in English.\n\u201cWe left the boxes in the village.

{"text":"Volume 4 Number 2\n\u00a9The Author(s) 2002\nThe Continuity Framework: A Tool for Building Home, School, and Community Partnerships\nAbstractWe will need to become savvy about how to build relationships, how to nurture growing, evolving things. All of us will need better skills in listening, communicating, and facilitating groups, because these are the talents that build strong relationships. (Wheatley, 1992, p. 38)\nIn the face of today's challenging social and family issues, many new efforts are underway to help children and families. One solution that many communities have adopted is the establishment of a collaborative partnership that involves all the relevant partners\u2014home, school, and community\u2014in the planning and monitoring of services for children. Unfortunately, achieving a strong partnership with meaningful participation can often be difficult and time-consuming. This article focuses on a set of training materials that has been developed to assist community partnerships in their efforts. These materials highlight eight elements of continuity and successful partnerships: (1) families as partners, (2) shared leadership, (3) comprehensive\/responsive services, (4) culture and home language, (5) communication, (6) knowledge and skill development, (7) appropriate care and education, and (8) evaluation of partnership success. Results from a field study that included more than 200 reviewers and 8 pilot sites are summarized. Results indicate that a majority of reviewers found the training materials easy to understand, relevant to their work, and up-to-date. In addition, data gathered from the pilot sites indicate that the partnerships found the materials practical and useful for addressing a variety of issues, including time constraints, communication gaps, differences in professional training, and funding limitations.\nCommunities face a host of problems that threaten the health and well-being of their children and families. Poverty, unemployment, inadequate care\/education, and poor health care are just a few of the difficult issues that communities must confront. What makes these issues particularly challenging is that children and families who experience one problem are often likely to experience other problems as well.\nCompounding the problem is that delivery of services to help children and families is typically fragmented and scattered. Even efforts designed to increase the quality and supply of services to children and families have, at times, created greater fragmentation and discontinuity.\nIn previous years, those who sought to improve outcomes for children concentrated only on the child. Today, however, many service providers have come to understand that the best way to serve and preserve children is to serve and preserve the supportive networks that benefit children (Family Support America, 1996). An extensive body of research identifies the elements that contribute to children's well-being, beginning with those closest to the child and moving outward to encompass the family, early care\/education, the neighborhood, the community, and beyond. This ecological perspective (Bronfenbrenner, 1979) has motivated a growing number of communities to focus more closely on the need for collaboration--engaging in a process that allows the community to address many problems at once rather than one at a time.\nOne solution that many communities have adopted is the establishment of a collaborative partnership involving all the relevant partners--home, school, and service providers--in the planning and monitoring of services for children (Kagan, 1992; Hoffman, 1991). The goal of most of these collaboration initiatives is to improve child outcomes, recognizing that many of the child's needs are closely linked to needs of the family and the community.\nChallenges to Collaboration\nCommunity collaboratives\/partnerships represent one of the most challenging--yet one of the most effective--efforts for creating a flexible, comprehensive system that meets the needs of children and families. They involve new relationships among service providers and the children and families they serve. They require time, resources, and the willingness of collaborating agencies to learn about and establish trust with each other. In short, they require change (Bruner, Kunesh, & Knuth, 1992).\nAs a result of the new roles and responsibilities that service providers must assume, collaboratives\/partnerships encounter many common difficulties, including (Melaville, Blank, & Asayesh, 1996):\n- staff or agency representatives who are resistant to relinquishing power;\n- policies and regulations within individual agencies that make it difficult to coordinate services, information, and resources;\n- differences in prior knowledge, training, or experience that make it difficult for members to communicate and work together; and\n- lack of time to meet and plan together.\nMany factors contribute to the success or failure of a community collaborative, and no two collaboratives operate in exactly the same way. However, certain guidelines seem to help smooth the way for a more successful partnership, including (North Central Regional Educational Laboratory, 1993):\n- involve all key stakeholders;\n- establish a shared vision of how the partnership will operate and expected outcomes for the children and families served;\n- build in ownership at all levels;\n- establish communication and decision-making processes that are open and allow conflict to be addressed constructively;\n- institutionalize changes through established policies, procedures, and program mandates;\n- provide adequate time for partners to meet, plan, and carry out activities.\nThe process of establishing and maintaining a collaborative partnership is not easy, and in the end, each partnership must find a way to proceed that is consistent with its community and unique set of circumstances. However, a number of resources and tools are available to help communities get started creating an effective system for delivering services. In this article, we describe one such tool that assembles elements essential to building a successful collaborative partnership.\nDevelopment of Continuity Framework Materials\nFor the past eight years, the 10 Regional Educational Laboratories (RELs) serving each region of the country have studied effective strategies for strengthening collaboration and increasing continuity among programs for young children and their families. The RELs are overseen by the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Educational Research and Improvement [now the Institute of Education Sciences], and their primary purpose is ensuring that those involved in educational improvement have access to the best information from research and practice. During the contract period of 1995-2000, the RELs established a program called the Laboratory Network Program (LNP), which convened representatives from each Laboratory as a national network working on common issues.\nIn 1995, the Early Childhood LNP developed Continuity in Early Childhood: A Framework for Home, School, and Community Linkages (U.S. Department of Education, 1995), a document designed with two key purposes in mind: first, an emphasis on the need for children and families to receive comprehensive and responsive services, reflected in the eight elements of continuity outlined in the Framework (see Figure 1). Taken together, the elements are intended to promote a comprehensive understanding of continuity and transition during early childhood. Second, the Framework offered a set of guidelines that partnerships could use to compare and assess their current policies and practices, as well as identify areas in need of improvement.\nFigure 1. Elements of Continuity\n(U.S.Department of Education, 1995)\nAn extensive field review of the Framework indicated that although the document was helpful and informative, many community partnerships continued to have difficulty \"getting started.\" As a result, a Trainer's Guide was developed to support the use of the Framework and assist community partnerships in the first stages. These materials were developed by the Early Childhood LNP in collaboration with the National Center for Early Development & Learning.\nThe Trainer's Guide provides an overview of the content and potential uses of the Framework and includes all activities and materials necessary to conduct training sessions. The Guide itself consists of four training sessions that are organized around the eight elements of continuity. The materials are designed so that a local partnership has everything needed to conduct the training: background information, scripts, handouts, transparencies, sample agendas, and checklists for additional equipment and supplies:\n- The first session, Understanding Continuity, is designed to introduce participants to the Framework document and help participants develop a greater understanding and appreciation for continuity.\n- The second session, Developing a Continuity Team, highlights the importance of broad representation and shared leadership among partnership members.\n- The third session, Planning for Continuity, emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach to service delivery and encourages participants to examine their current partnership practices and policies.\n- The final session, Formalizing Continuity, focuses on the importance of effective communication among group members and provides participants with an opportunity to formulate action plans.\nThe Guide is designed to be a flexible training tool, adaptable to meet the needs of a particular audience. The intended audience includes local partnerships for children and families (including Smart Start partnerships in North Carolina), Head Start Program representatives, public schools, and communities. The overall objectives of the training are (1) to enhance the collaborative's knowledge and understanding of continuity, (2) to strengthen and support collaborative groups in their efforts to work as partners, and (3) to maximize the benefit they might receive from using the Framework.\nWhat follows is a description of the field test that was designed to assess the use and effectiveness of the Trainer's Guide. The field test focused exclusively on the Framework materials--no other instructional sources were employed. We will present the major findings of the field test and summarize recommendations based on those findings. In addition, we will highlight the work of several collaborative partnerships that took part in the field study, and we will describe some of the problems they encountered, how they used the Framework materials to address those problems, and where they are today. Specifically, the evaluation will explore:\n- To what extent is the information contained in the Framework and Trainer's Guide relevant and useful to community partnerships?\n- What is the perceived impact of the training and Framework on partnership activities?\n- How do partnerships incorporate elements of the Framework into their ongoing activities?\n- Of the review sites that indicated interest in the training materials, what proportion actually conducted the training?\nThe overall usefulness and effectiveness of the Trainer's Guide was studied in two phases. Phase One consisted of document review and feedback from individuals working in the early childhood field. In Phase Two of field testing, the training was actually piloted in eight partnership sites.\nPhase One: Document Review\nReviewers for the Trainer's Guide were solicited through the Laboratory Network Program (LNP) and at conferences related to early childhood issues. Three hundred thirteen individuals\/organizations requested a set of the Framework materials (participant manual, Trainer's Guide, and a sample color transparency) and feedback form. Feedback questions centered on four areas: (1) information's relevancy and accuracy, (2) format and organization of the Trainer's Guide, (3) specific training needs, and (4) possible barriers to conducting training.\nOf the 313 requesting materials, 215 (68.7%) reviewers returned feedback forms. Twenty-one percent (N = 45) of the respondents were members of a Smart Start partnership (North Carolina initiative), 19% (N = 40) worked in Head Start agencies, and 11% (N = 24) worked in family resource centers. Others included representatives from state agencies, school personnel, and university faculty. A majority (89%) of the respondents indicated that they are actively involved in a community partnership.\nFinal Follow-up with Select Reviewer Sites. Of the original 215 organizations\/individuals who reviewed the Framework materials, 80 indicated an interest in conducting the training in its entirety and requested a complete set of transparencies. (The original materials included one sample color transparency, and the REL offered a complete set of Framework transparencies to all organizations making the request.) Approximately one year after receiving the materials, interviews were conducted with representatives who received transparencies. The purpose of these follow-up telephone calls was to determine if the materials had been used and the degree to which outside support or assistance might be needed to conduct the training.\nPhase Two: Pilot Training\nDuring the second phase of the field testing, the training was piloted in eight collaborative partnerships from across the nation (see Table 1). These sites were recruited through the LNP and selected based on their interest in the project. To assist with logistical details, a liaison, identified at each site, coordinated training dates and assisted with data collection. Sites varied according to demographics, partnership maturity, and sponsoring or lead agency.\n|Site Location||Community Type||Sponsor\/Lead Agency|\n|Beaufort, SC||Rural||Success by 6|\n|Dothan, AL||Urban||Family Resource Center|\n|Walnut Cove, NC||Rural||Smart Start|\n|Valdosta, GA||Rural||Family Connections\/County Commission|\n|Wheeling, WV||Rural||Head Start|\n|Troy, NC||Rural||Smart Start|\n|Concord, WV||Rural||Family Resource Center|\nFive of the partnerships described themselves as existing collaboratives (two years or more), while the remaining three indicated that they were in the planning stages of building a collaborative partnership. Sponsors of the partnerships included Smart Start (2); Head Start, family resource centers (2); Success by 6; a public school system; and a county task force.\nAcross the eight sites, a total of 160 individuals participated in the training. Approximately 64% of the attendees were White, 27% were African American, and the remainder were either Hispanic, American Indian\/Alaskan Native, or multiracial.\nSeveral of the partnerships invited persons who were not part of the collaborative partnership to attend the training. As a result, slightly more than half (54%) of the participants reported that they were current members of the partnership. The majority of these had been members less than one year (53%). Early childhood specialists represented the largest group attending the training (29%), followed by program administrators (18%), teachers\/caregivers (14%), and parents (10%). Other groups represented included policy makers, members of the business community, and university faculty.\nEach of the sites conducted the entire training course in the fall; however, there was some variability in delivery of training. For example, some partnerships conducted the training as described in the Trainer's Guide--two complete, consecutive days of training. Other partnerships modified the training schedule to meet the needs of its members and used other formats such as one day of training followed two weeks later by a second day of training.\nAt the conclusion of training, participants were asked to provide feedback on specific elements of the training, including organization, training content, and materials\/resources. In addition, participants were asked to comment on their satisfaction with the training and the overall usefulness of the training materials. This information, along with information gathered from the review sites, was used to revise the Trainer's Guide.\nIn the six months following the training, partnership activities were studied to determine the degree to which the collaboratives incorporated content from the Framework into their regular activities. Materials studied included a record of stakeholder attendance and meeting minutes documenting partnership activities. At the end of this period, a follow-up survey was sent to participants at each pilot site. Survey questions focused on three major areas: (1) impact of the training, (2) impact of the Framework materials, and (3) overall familiarity with Framework materials.\nIn addition to the final survey with individuals who participated in the training, a final interview was conducted with seven site liaisons (one liaison was unavailable for interview). Interview questions focused on the original goal of the partnership, reasons for participating in the field study, and impact of the training and Framework materials.\nThe data were analyzed to determine general response patterns and to identify logical changes or improvements to the Trainer's Guide. Both quantitative and qualitative techniques were used to analyze data from the review sites and the pilot sites.\nPhase One: Document Review\nAnalyses of data from reviewer sites were conducted on 215 surveys. Table 2 summarizes Trainer's Guide as easy to understand, relevant to their work, accurate, and up-to-date.\n|Survey Statement||Agreed or Strongly Agreed with Statement|\n|Information is accurate and up to date.||94.9% (4.54)|\n|Format is easy to understand and follow.||93.9% (4.49)|\n|Training materials were easy to understand and follow.||92.5% (4.46)|\n|Information is relevant to my work.||89.3% (4.41)|\n|I would be comfortable using the materials.||83.3% (4.29)|\n|*Note: According to the scale, 1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree. Mean scores are presented in parentheses.|\nA series of open-ended questions provided respondents with an opportunity to provide more specific information and feedback. When asked what parts of the training were most useful, of those who responded, approximately 30% reported that the materials were the most useful part of the training. Reviewers specifically mentioned handouts, transparencies, and checklists. Another 22% reported that the information focusing on the need to include families and share leadership responsibilities was most useful.\nReviewers also were asked to identify the greatest training need within their partnerships. Of those who responded, more than one-third (34%) reported that they often need assistance identifying and including community stakeholders. Reviewers cited family members and members of the business community as groups that often are poorly represented at partnership meetings. Other topics representing challenges to partnerships included developing the team, sharing leadership responsibilities, and involving families in meaningful ways.\nIn terms of barriers or factors that would influence the use of training, most of the respondents (75%) cited time as the greatest barrier to conducting training. This factor was followed by a lack of funding (68%), the unavailability of a trainer (45%), and lack of interest of collaborative partners (39%).\nFinal Follow-up with Select Reviewer Sites. Of the 80 individuals\/organizations who requested a complete set of transparencies, 68 were located for follow-up interviews (85%). For the remaining 12, attempts to contact the site were unsuccessful; either the person requesting the transparencies was no longer there, or the materials were never received.\nInterviews revealed that 23 of the respondents had conducted training using the Framework and accompanying materials. Of those who stated that they had conducted the training, only two (less than 10%) had used the training in its entirety. Most had conducted at least one part of the training, selecting the portions most useful for their work. \"Families as Partners,\" \"Shared Leadership,\" and \"Comprehensive and Responsive Services\" were the elements from the Framework most often used for training.\nAn additional 17% said that although they had not conducted the training as designed, they had adapted the materials or used them in other circumstances. Examples of how they had adapted the materials included using the exercises, overheads, major concepts, and other information in training activities.\nHead Start agencies were the primary sponsors for half of the training events. Public schools, area education associations, state departments of education, local partnerships, child development centers, and related-type centers were listed as sponsors or lead agencies for the remaining training activities.\nTraining participants included staff and administrators at Head Start agencies, preschool and child care providers, local education agencies, schools, school improvement teams, state departments of education staff, local family service agencies and boards of directors, and parents.\nAll who said they had used the training materials were asked to comment on the usefulness of the training. The majority of respondents rated the training as \"very useful\" or \"useful,\" and all said they would recommend the training to others. Particular aspects of the training that respondents liked included:\n- professional quality, clarity of materials, and sequencing of content of the Framework;\n- handouts, activities, and overheads;\n- content and the ability to present the material at multiple skill levels; and\n- ease of use of the Framework.\nThere were suggestions for improving the training. Four respondents said the course was \"too long,\" especially if used in school systems or with parents. Others maintained a need for greater emphasis on action planning and implementation, \"more written support materials (research, position support, background), and additional copies of key pieces of materials that helped shape the Framework.\"\nPhase Two: Pilot Training\nIn terms of the training quality and overall effectiveness, most of the participants rated the training sessions as either \"good\" or \"excellent.\" Participants tended to rate the second day of training as higher in quality and more effective than the first day of training (M = 4.392 and M = 4.17, respectively, based on a 5-point scale).\nParticipants also evaluated the effects of the training and estimated its impact on future partnership practices. Using a four-point Likert-type scale, participants rated the extent to which they agreed with each statement. Table 3 summarizes participants' appraisal of the training and reinforces the focus of the original training objectives.\nObjective 1: To enhance the collaborative's knowledge and understanding of continuity\n|As a result of the training, I believe that I am motivated to build and strengthen continuity efforts in my community.||3.44||.65|\n|As a result of the training, I believe that I have a better understanding of continuity and why it is important.||3.41||.65|\n|I believe that this training will have an impact on increasing awareness of new skills and knowledge for our team.||3.31||63|\nObjective 2: To strengthen and support collaborative groups in their efforts to works as partners\n|As a result of the training, I believe that I am better able to participate as a member of a home, school, and community partnership.||3.40||.65|\n|I believe that this training will have an impact on how decisions are made and the planning we do for services.||3.25||.59|\n|I believe that this training will have an impact on changing\/enhancing the quality of community practices.||3.23||.58|\nObjective 3: To maximize the benefit the collaborative might receive from using the Framework\n|As a result of the training, I believe that I am better able to use the Framework as a tool for exploring continuity and transition||3.26||.63|\n|I believe that this training will have an impact on positively affecting outcomes for children and families.||3.31||.63|\n|*Note: According to the scale, 1 = strongly disagree and 4 = strongly agree.|\nIn addition to participant ratings immediately following the training, data were collected on regular partnership activities after the training. Analysis of materials such as meeting minutes revealed that during the six months following completion of the training, five of the eight sites reported that they continued to use the Framework materials. Exactly how the materials were used varied from site to site. Two of the sites selected specific elements of the Framework as their priority concerns for the coming year. They then organized subcommittees to review the partnerships' practices with respect to those elements and make recommendations for improving existing services. Another partnership used the materials to provide training to other agencies and organizations not directly involved with the partnership. The remaining two partnerships used the Framework as a resource for improving transition practices with their communities.\nAt the end of the six months, a final survey was distributed to participants at the last partnership meeting of the year, and surveys were mailed to those not in attendance at the final meeting. Approximately half of the individuals who participated in the training (81 of 160) responded to the survey. Participants were asked to rate the extent to which the Framework materials had had an impact on partnership practices. On a four-point scale (4 = \"a great deal,\" 3 = \"some,\" 2 = \"very little,\" and 1 = \"not at all\"), the majority of respondents (88.6%) reported that the training had \"impacted\" their knowledge and skill development \"some\" or a \"great deal.\" Respondents also thought that the Framework had at least \"some\" impact on the knowledge and skills development of their partnership (83%) and community (72%). The majority (97.4%) speculated that the Framework would have at least some future impact.\nFinally, participants were asked to indicate the single greatest impact they experienced as a result of the training. Approximately 41% reported that as a result of the training they felt more motivated to build or strengthen efforts to support continuity of services for children in their communities. Thirty-five percent of the respondents said they had a better understanding of continuity and its importance; 17% felt that the training prepared them to be better members of their partnership; and 7% said that the training gave them a greater understanding of the Framework as a tool.\nStokes County Partnership for Children, King, NC\nAn ongoing goal of the Stokes County Partnership for Children is to create a system that encourages service providers to work together and promotes continuity for children and their families. Members of the partnership began by using the Framework to build their own knowledge and skills about continuity; however, they soon recognized the need to inform others of the importance of continuity in children's lives. As a result, the Partnership conducted a series of focus groups and meetings among parents and family members within the community. They used information from Elements 3 (Comprehensive\/Responsive Services) and 7 (Developmentally Appropriate Care\/Education) to explain what was needed to support continuity and its potential benefits for children. These meetings were also an opportunity to inform families of the various resources and supports available within the community. Later, the focus groups were expanded to include all stakeholders (e.g., child care, kindergarten, Head Start, school administrators, special needs coordinators, etc). The information gathered from these meetings has been used to guide the development and implementation of policies and practices that promote continuity.\nFinal Interview with Liaisons. In the final interview conducted with site liaisons, five of the seven liaisons reported that the overall goal of their partnership is to improve services for children and their families by connecting agencies and strengthening the collaborative bonds between those agencies. Three of the liaisons specifically mentioned the need to improve transitions and create a system of responsive and comprehensive services.\nIn addition, liaisons were asked to talk about their reasons for participating in the field-test process. At least three of the liaisons cited low levels of collaboration across agencies and indicated that partnership meetings were used primarily as a time for sharing information. Others saw the training as an opportunity to invite additional partners to the table and begin a discussion of how they could better work together.\nFinally, liaisons were asked to rate the extent to which the Framework materials had been helpful in accomplishing their overall partnership goal. Using a five-point scale, five of the liaisons rated the Framework materials as either \"helpful\" (4) or \"very helpful\" (5). The remaining two liaisons rated the Framework materials as at least \"somewhat helpful\" (3).\nDeveloping and maintaining a community collaborative is hard work, and it is a challenge that requires a great deal of commitment and cooperation from those involved. Training and resource materials available to help community partnerships build a more responsive system must address such issues as time constraints, communication gaps, differences in professional training, and funding limitations. Given these challenges, the Continuity Framework and its Trainer's Guide seem to be important and useful tools for helping partnerships increase collaboration and involvement.\nData gathered from participant ratings and key-informant interviews indicated that the training was helpful in a number of ways. A feature of the training mentioned by many of the participants was the fact that the experience helped \"level the playing field.\" That is, it provided stakeholders with a common language to use as they worked together. As illustrated in the following example, stakeholders often come from a variety of agencies and backgrounds, which can be a major impediment when a community must begin to work together and coordinate its efforts.\nThe case studies in the sidebars highlight the work of four collaborative partnerships that took part in the field study. These case studies discuss some of the problems they encountered, how they used the Framework materials to address those problems, and where they are today.\nBovill, Idaho, Collaborative\nBovill is a small town (population 310) located in the north central part of the state. Bovill has no resident doctor or dentist. At the time, there also was no child care center or preschool available to children. (The closest one was 35 miles away.)\nIn 1998, various members of the community decided that they wanted to do something to help improve the situation for children. This group of citizens brought together parents and virtually every local organization to work on a plan that would support the learning needs of children and their families. Part of this effort was a proposal submitted to the J.A. and Kathryn Albertson Foundation that would help fund an early learning center. In 1999, they were awarded a grant, and they began the work to open the Bovill Early Childhood Community Learning Center.\nHowever, once the work began, members of the partnership found that they did not have a common vocabulary to talk about the issues of early childhood education. There were also difficulties associated with establishing a partnership, such as \"Who else should be included?\" and \"How do you get started?\" In an effort to \"get started\" and begin the planning process, the partnership elected to participate in the field testing of the Framework materials.\nFramework training was provided over two consecutive days and built into the inservice training schedule of the elementary school. In addition to staff and faculty from the elementary school, representatives from other agencies and organizations participated, including the health department, the Idaho Department of Disabilities, news media, schools, early childhood education, Even Start, parents, university students, attorneys, community leaders, and businesses.\nAccording the site liaison, the Framework materials were used:\n- To improve awareness of key issues in providing high-quality services. The Framework provides direction to help develop a program that really works.\n- To provide a common language and for internal communication enhancement. Now everyone \"speaks the same language.\"\n- As an external communication tool. According to the liaison, \"it is so much easier to talk with funding sources when you use the structure of the elements as a base.\"\n- To validate their progress toward providing the best practices in early childhood education.\n- As a piece of the Bovill Elementary School improvement plan.\nPositive impact on individual partnership members was cited as another basis for success of the training. Many indicated they had a better understanding of continuity and were more motivated to continue to work on the difficult issues that often arise as part of the collaborative process. An added value of the training was the opportunity to spend time together and develop relationships with persons from other agencies. Often, these individual relationships help form the basis for collaborative work within the partnership.\nBased on the sites that continued to use the materials, the Continuity Framework and its Trainer's Guide seem to be equally useful to both existing and newly established partnerships. A common experience in the maturation of partnerships is that they are prone to lose initial momentum, often stagnating into \"easy\" roles such as simple information sharing. A serendipitous discovery of this study is that such partnerships evidenced rejuvenation of their efforts after participating in the training (see the Valdosta, Georgia, example).\nValdosta, Georgia, Collaborative\nThe Lowndes County\/Valdosta Commission for Children and Youth has been in existence for more than a decade, and during this time, the partnership has experienced various \"ups and downs.\" According to site liaison Vickie Elliott, cycles are a normal part of the collaborative process, \"They may be the result of staff turnover or changes in the board chair and\/or board members.\" She reports that participation in the training provided members with practical, research-based information. This information served as a reminder to members that they were doing good work and that their work was important.\nSince the training, the partnership has continued to use Framework materials as a reference and resource. For example, during a recent meeting, members began a discussion regarding the evaluation of partnership activities. They used Element 8: Evaluation of Partnership Success to help shape and guide this discussion. In addition, the partnership has applied for and received a 21st Century Learning Community grant. Because of the knowledge and understanding they gained during the training, members requested funds for a case manager position to be based at each school and conducting home visits. It is hoped that this strategy will facilitate communication and create greater continuity of services for students and families.\nFinally, the data indicate that change takes place slowly. Participants reported that the training had had some impact on their community but felt that the greatest impact was yet to come. Bringing everyone to the table is not enough. True collaboration that produces continuity in services for children takes place over a long period of time, as agencies that have not previously worked together begin to get to know each other and slowly modify procedures and practices.\nMarshall County Tadpole Team, Wheeling, WV\nEfforts to collaborate are often driven by the realization that single agencies cannot solve problems alone. Partners must be willing to jointly plan and implement new ventures, as well as pool resources such as money and personnel. Nowhere is this need to collaborate and pool resources more crucial than in Marshall County, WV. Located in the northern part of West Virginia, Marshall County remains a predominantly rural county. With a population of approximately 36,000, Marshall County has seen a decline in the number of residents over the past two to three years, largely attributed to the economic hardships of the area. This part of West Virginia relies heavily on the coal and steel industries, and as these industries have fallen on hard times, so too have many families. As a result, many families have moved away to find other employment; however, many others have sought support from social services agencies within the community. In order to make the most of the limited resources and support available within the county, many of the local agencies (e.g., Northern Panhandle Head Start, Starting Points Center, Tadpoles Team) came together to form a community collaborative. Although their collaborative meetings began more as a time for sharing information, members soon realized that to be a true \"working group,\" they would need to broaden the meeting agendas and formalize the collaborative relationships. Using the Framework materials as an assessment tool, members worked through each element identifying the gaps in services and generating ideas for possible programs and procedures to address those gaps. This shift encouraged members to devote meeting times to discussing specific issues facing the community. Moreover, it encouraged members to formalize the partnership with written agreements. These agreements have allowed members to make a solid commitment to the collaborative, as well as clarify specific roles and responsibilities for services.\nBeyond the content of the training and issues related to the collaborative process, the field study underscored the importance of training structure and design. Many study participants praised the Framework materials for flexibility and relevance to a variety of contexts. The training materials were designed so that particular attention was devoted to issues such as target audience attributes (e.g., varied educational and professional development backgrounds), which dictate the appropriate level of sophistication as well as the need for course module structure (i.e., overall organization and scripting) to be highly adaptable to local training needs.\nThe field studies indicate that community partnerships benefit from training and technical assistance that help with the process of getting started, as well as recapturing momentum and focus. Additional research is needed to document the ongoing efforts of these communities and explore whether the Framework materials continue to have an impact on community practices and outcomes, as many of the participants predicted. Further study also is needed to determine what other kinds of training or technical assistance might be useful to these partnerships as they work to build capacity and expand or grow new programs.\nBronfenbrenner, Urie.

Use of the site also exposed more than five million U.S. households to virus infections, identity theft and other types of abuse.\nTo guard against abuse, Consumer Reports recommends parents carefully monitor their children's Facebook accounts, joining their children's circle of friends on the site and either deleting a pre-teen's account or asking Facebook to do so by filling out its \"report an underage child\" form.\nAlso, use the site's privacy controls. Roughly one in five adult users said they hadn't, making them more vulnerable to threats. Consumer Reports advices users to set everything you can so that it can only be accessed by people on your friends list.

{"text":"Tooth decay prevalent among Alaska native children\nSep 23, 2011, 7:36 a.m.\nBy Yereth Rosen\nANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - Native Alaskan children living in remote villages have rates of tooth decay about four times the national average, a government study showed.\nLack of fluoridated water and an abundance of sugary, carbonated soda pop were the major reasons cited in the research that tracked dental health of children in the mostly Yupik Eskimo region of southwestern Alaska.\nDr. Brad Whistler, Alaska state oral health director and a co-author of the study, said children need major dental work.\n\"When they smile, you see a lot of silver teeth,\" he said.\nSuch severe decay sets up children to have serious dental problems as adults, Whistler said.\nOne reason for the high level of tooth decay is poor water-system infrastructure in many Alaska Native villages, which prevents the fluoridation of drinking water that has helped lower rates of tooth decay.\nIn some villages that were part of the study, residents must haul water home from central pumps, he said. Even those places with more sophisticated systems are likely to lack fluoride in drinking water, because few qualified technicians are available to work in such far-flung locations and install the necessary equipment.\nThe other major problem is the erosion of the traditional Native diet with the introduction of food laden with sugar, Whistler said.\nThe study, by the federal Centers for Disease Control and the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services, analyzed 2008 dental records and habits of 348 children between the ages of four and 15.\n(Editing by Alex Dobuzinskis and Cynthia Johnston)","id":"<urn:uuid:4759913c-8438-40ae-a72f-7bb00cf046b8>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/spot55.com\/news\/2011\/sep\/23\/tooth-decay-prevalent-among-alaska-native-children\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9556977153,"token_count":354,"score":2.984375,"int_score":3}
{"text":"knowledge is from the heart as well as the mind. It is not a mere\nmental perception of the forms of things or a knowledge of their\nmaterial nature; it must include the soul of things, the divine ideas\nthat they enshrine.\nEverything is dependent on the small things: relaxation - you\nalways relax more; acceptance, oneself and others - can always try;\nhouse-cleaning - will always be just as difficult, but at least you\nhave done it before. It is important to do all these little things\nQuestion: - How can we discern\nwhether it is the divine conscience animating us and directing us in a\ncertain direction, or the\nanimal soul seeking release from seemingly unfavorable environments:\nAnswer: - The divine conscience acts in all struggles for betterment, but clouded more or less in each by reason of education and habit of thought; hence it varies in brightness. It is not possible to make a hard-and-fast fixed rule for finding out what is the animating motive. If we are trying to get into a better state, it is for us to decide if that be simply and wholly selfish. All actions are surrounded by desire as the rust is round the polished metal or the smoke round the fire, but we must try. So if we fix for ourselves the rule that we will try to do the best we can for others, we will generally be led right. If we rely on the higher self and aspire to be guided by it, we will be led to the right even if the road goes through pain, for sorrow and pain are necessary for purification of the soul. But if we wish to run away from an environment because we do not like it and without trying to live in it while not of it, we are not altering ourselves but simply altering the circumstances, and may not always gain anything.\nQuestioner: What is your attitude to the early teachings of Theosophy, the Blavatsky type? Do you consider we have deteriorated or advanced?\nKRISHNAMURTI: I am afraid I do not know, because I do not know what Madame Blavatsky's teachings are. Why should I? Why should you know of someone else's teachings? You know, there is only one truth, and therefore there is only one way, which is not distant from the truth; there is only one method to that truth, because the means are not distinct from the end.\nNow you who have studied Madame Blavatsky's and the latest Theosophy, or whatever it is, why do you want to be students of books instead of students of life? Why do you set up leaders and ask whose teachings are better? Don't you see? Please, I am not being harsh, or anything of that kind. Don't you see? You are Christians; find out what is true and false in Christianity\u2014and you will then find out what is true. Find out what is true and false in your environment with all its oppressions and cruelties, and then you will find out what is true. Why do you want philosophies? Because life is an ugly thing, and you hope to run away from it through philosophy. Life is so empty, dull, stupid, ignominious, and you want something to bring romanticism into your world, some hope, some lingering, haunting feeling; whereas, if you really faced the world as it is, and tackled it, you would find it something much more, infinitely greater than any philosophy, greater than any book in the world, greater than any teaching or greater than any teacher.\nWe have really lost all sense of feeling, feeling for the oppressed, and feeling for the oppressor. You only feel when you are oppressed. So gradually we have intellectually explained away all our feelings, our sensitiveness, our delicate perceptions, until we are absolutely shallow; and to fill that shallowness, to enrich ourselves, we study books.\nThe Theosophical Society has had three objects for more than a century. They are:\nOf these three objects the first has been considered the most important, at least since the time H.P. Blavatsky and H.S. Olcott arrived in India in 1879. Strangely enough the 'mission-statement' of the Theosophical Society in Wheaton (Adyar) rephrases the above, but leaves brotherhood out. It is as follows:\nTo encourage open-minded enquiry into world religions, philosophy, science, and the arts in order to understand the wisdom of the ages, respect the unity of all life, and help people explore spiritual self-transformation.\nA mission statement is merely another word for aim or object. So one would expect the three objects of the Theosophical Society to agree precisely with the mission-statement. One would also expect the wording of the mission-statement to be more modern. In that vein it would have been a nice challenge if the board of directors of the US-section of the TS had found a new sex-neutral way of saying that people should treat each other well. What else does a 'nucleus of the Universal Brotherhood of Humanity (etc)' mean? But to leave it all out is really going too far for me, and for several of the people I met in Wheaton this summer. This mission-statement sounds selfish to me. Great: I find an organisation where people will help me with my self-transformation en where my open enquiry into religions, spirituality and science will be supported. Wonderful. And there is no suggestion that I personally need to do anything at all. I don't need to practice loving kindness. I don't need to find tolerance in my heart for those I've learned to despise or ignore. I will perhaps learn to respect the unity of all life in abstract, but there is no need for me to do anything practical at all...\nI'm obviously being cynical. In actual fact the attempt to form a nucleus of the Universal Brotherhood of Humanity, without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or color is work. It means a constant attempt to overcome my conditioning. It means reaching out to people. It means practicing kindness. It means learning to deal with people I may not like. I find it very disappointing that the TS in America has edited this very important attempt out of its 'mission statement' and hope they will change things soon.\nEach summer the American Section of the Theosophical Society (TS) has a gathering that is both business meeting and summer school. Non-members of the TS are not explicitly invited, but in practice nothing is done to discourage them from coming either. The atmosphere of the gathering was both very familiar to me, as strange and new. Familiar, as it was as comfortable talking to these overseas theosophists, as it has always been talking to theosophists here in the Netherlands. Strange as well, as inevitably things are done differently, when there is a different host-country.\nThe opening was a lot former than I'm used to seeing it. 'evening dress optional' says it all, I think. For those who have not been to Olcott for this: evening dress means suits and ties and dresses and in the case of theosophists: saris and Indian dresses in general. First Betty Bland, the national president of the TS in the USA, welcomed us. Then there were prayers from 'all the world's religions', though this is obviously practically impossible there were a lot. The atmosphere of that ceremony was more informal than I saw it in India. It looked like people could just come up and give whatever prayer they wanted. Among the many prayers more than one Christian denomination was represented, as well as Islam, the gayatri mantra and a humanist prayer. The opening ended with greetings from all over the world. I gave greetings from the Netherlands and the International Theosophical Centre at Naarden also in the Netherlands.\nThe business meeting consisted of reports from the various departments. I was surprised to see the work that went into making it literally entertaining. The Quest Bookshop even got a (fake) s\u0165ance on the way in which Annie Besant appeared. This is certainly different from how I'm used to seeing it, but I enjoyed myself anyhow.\nThe theme of the school was 'Theosophy in action'. Radha Burnier, international president, gave most of the lectures. Room had been made for Diana Chapotin's coverage of the Order of Service, John Algeo and Joy Mills. After the main lecture, each morning, there were group discussion that were - as usual - very interesting. In the afternoon there were usually lectures, workshops and meditation classes. To be honest I wasn't impressed with what I saw of the meditation classes. Theosophists don't have a reputation of being very good at meditation and this didn't help any in my book. The morning meditation even reminded me of group hypnosis. A bad sign that confirmed this impression was that several people told me that they had a tendency to fall asleep during the morning-meditation.\nThe lectures were very good. Radha Burnier's opening lecture was about finding balance. She meant finding a balance between the development of buddhi (roughly intuition), thought, emotion and action. If there is insight, don't act on it immediately. Let it germinate, it will express itself naturally in action or words at some point. Spiritual aspiration as well needs to be in harmony. Too much of it leads to ambition, too much tension or waste of energy. Mental balance includes overcoming the duality of thought. This means that likes and dislikes will disappear and we will neither accept nor reject what IS.\nDiana Chapotin, in her lecture about the Theosophical Order of Service (TOS), stressed that theosophists are active in social service in various ways. One of the main ways is individual action. She meant that theosophists all over the world are active in social work through organisations that have nothing to do with theosophy. The second way in which theosophists are active practically in the world is through the activities of local theosophical lodges and sections. The TOS complements all that with very specific projects in area's like education, animal welfare, vegetarianism and help in case of natural disasters like recently Katrina. On an organisational level TOS-groups are led by theosophists, but the volunteers don't have to be members. Though any kind of social work can be taken on, it is necessary that central theosophical values behind the work are communicated regularly to keep the work theosophical. Diana explained that the work of the TOS has grown dramatically recently under her leadership. She can't cope on her own anymore and a reorganisation is necessary.\nJoy Mills gave a public lecture on the vitality of living truth. She stressed the difference between living wisdom and book wisdom. Theosophists always risk not going beyond book wisdom. If we really see the truth, our heart and our whole being will change. That's the power of living truth. In order for that to happen, we need to actually practice truth as we know it (not as we want it to be) in our daily lives. Every experience that broadens our sensitivity, mirrors living truth for us. In modern thought the interconnectedness of everything is becoming quite clear. H.P. Blavatsky actually went one step further: she saw everything as one living being, One Life. The theory of Gaia shows this on the level of the earth, but for Blavatsky it's true of the whole universe. Breath is used as an image of that Oneness.\nRadha's second lecture dealt with a very central theme: growing in wisdom. In this lecture she repeated a theme that threads through her Watchtower pieces in The Theosophist as well: Humanity grows in knowledge, but not in wisdom. The knowledge that has been developed over the past two centuries leads to destruction because there is no knowledge on what is right in the long run. It is relatively easy to develop knowledge. It is very hard to find out what right action is. We don't realise enough that in hurting someone else, we hurt ourselves. Wisdom leads to a peaceful, sensitive world. Knowledge leads to pride and this can only be challenged by becoming aware of the limitations of knowledge. Otherwise knowledge leads to a feeling of separateness. On the other hand it is necessary to learn to think independently and become aware to what extent we are all influenced by others. An example she gave is that the simple life is no longer seen as ideal. Everybody wants to live as is portrayed on television. In all her lectures this week Radha reminded us that our personal problems need to come second. Growth in wisdom means growth in altruism and that means forgetting self. Our personal problems and our joys are both temporary. We make them bigger than they are. Why is suffering such a large problem? The TS was founded to fight prejudice. Prejudice hinders an insight into real problems and can only be dissolved by a feeling of connectedness with all human beings. Our altruism needs to become universal. The Buddha said: it's better to give a little lovingly, than to give a lot without love.\nIt was very impressive to hear the report of theosophists living near the area where Katrina hit. There were slides as accompanying there very personal report. The most important insight I got from that was that storms are normal for the people in this region. Normally people do not leave in case of a storm. Despite that fact, and this has not been stressed enough, this was the most successful evacuation in history. Around 90-95% of the people in the New Orleans region were evacuated. We were told that criminals always stay behind so they can loot. This is part of the pattern. Because this storm did so much more damage than most other storms, everything got bigger than usual.\nJohn Algeo spoke about the most holy mission of theosophy. He started by saying that Blavatsky in her final five years on earth, had left a legacy of five:\nThese three letters were the backbone to Johns two lectures. They give direction to Theosophical work in the world. Blavatsky's last years were tough, but John stressed that out of disaster, blessings often come. Disasters mix things up. Tibetan Buddhism would never have spread to the West as it has, if China hadn't invaded Tibet. In her 1891 letter, Blavatsky mainly spoke of living theosophy, not the teachings. In her first letter she stressed the aim of the Theosophical Society to unite people of all nations and altruism. Organisations are important, but they can't created holiness, health or wholeness. We have to become fully human, that is what the word master signifies: to master ourselves. There can only be harmony in organisations, if opposites are balanced, not through wiping out differences. In his second lecture he returned to the theme of unifying people of all nations. He also pointed out that every wise administration knows that things can't be forced. No rule can open the heart-mind of people. No group is safe from fundamentalism. Theosophists too run this risk, though in real theosophy there can be no dogmas, because it is based on real insight and rational thinking. Real theosophy reflects divine reason, the reason of Buddhi. John closed with Blavatsky's words in the last letter to the American Conventions: to be theosophists, live theosophy.\nIn her next lecture Radha talked about growing in Love. Love is our true being, that aspect of ourselves which is one with every other. Love is beyond words, it's part of Universal Life. It is necessary to feel affection for kids and animals. Continually looking for security, that wish masks a desire for Love. Our world is dark, there is little friendship, little Love. How do we remove the barriers that separate us from our essential nature: Love? To this practical question, Radha's answer is to be more sensitive. We have to feel as others feel, without identifying with their pain. You can't help others by going along with their pain, but you have to know what it is. Right action requires going beyond social custom and convention and being really sensitive. This sensitivity doesn't hinder our happiness. Our real nature isn't just Love, it's also Bliss. But we need to become conscious of other people. Unkind thoughts hurt others, and ultimately ourselves. They are like a hungry wolf that eats up our best tendencies. Annie Besant said that if we can't see God in others, we must be the worst possible atheists. The problem with gossip is that it is superficial. We have to learn to look under the surface, without judgment of any kind. The habit to criticize strengthens the ego. Be a missionary of Love and generosity. Be prepared to give of yourself. Don't just do what is necessary, but actively contribute to the welfare of people in conversation. Every tendency of personality has to disappear. That way of looking teaches us to overcome pettiness. The first step is the last step, because the direction in which we move is of primary importance.\nRadha's final lecture was called 'purification through action'. Real wisdom is in seeing action in non-action and non-action in action. The central question she asked: what is right action? Each of us has to decide that for ourselves. Keep in mind that our energy impacts the world, not just our actions. Everything is interconnected. That's why abstaining from action isn't the same thing as freedom from action. When actions create problems, it's not right action. Right action is necessary, but we have to avoid identifying with it. In everything you do, ask yourself if there is egoism involved. The tricky part is that even that thought is in a way selfish. We need an inner balance that is independent of success or failure. Success and failure are part of the ups and downs of life, but we don't have to inwardly get involved in that. The risk of accomplishment is that one starts thinking: I can do this. That feeling can get in the way of right action. The problem with selfish action is that even if the short-term result seems good, it's never permanent. Radha closed with one of Krishnamurti's insights: actions that are a product of the past, don't work. Action only works if it's the consequence of right insight. This lecture was very insightful, but I missed one aspect that the title does suggest: that sometimes insight follows unselfish action. Right action can help clean the personality. One has to start somewhere.\nThe final session was a question and answer round with Radha Burnier, Joy Mills and John Algeo. The questions had come in through the internet and from the discussion groups. What follows is a selection. Can Muslims become members of the Theosophical Society? Yes, we have Muslim members in Indonesia, India and Pakistan. Radha stressed that Muslim women aren't forced to stay at home in all countries. In many countries they are free. Why do people ignore the Middle Path? The middle path is hard, said Radha, people prefer it easy. It's hard to overcome the tendency to overdo things. A question was asked about loving yourself. Joy Mills answered that it is important to look at yourself objectively. Observe yourself, it is unnecessary to become emotional or judgmental about yourself. Loving yourself means accepting what is, and resolving to change. Radha asks what it means to love yourself. Can you love your shadow? Reality IS, it doesn't need to be loved.\nAs this summary shows, the lectures were very interesting and deep. I really enjoyed myself and met some very good people.","id":"<urn:uuid:94c05889-67fb-45ec-b0e9-6e5f7d80bc05>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/lucifer7.katinkahesselink.net\/i\/2006\/9.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9737836123,"token_count":4095,"score":2.53125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Britain has, at least going by ministerial statements, apparently grasped the difference between arranged marriages, which are part of the Indian cultural tradition, and forced marriages, unjustifiable from any standpoint. Yet it is a challenging task to tackle the problem of forced marriages. According to the British reckoning, the figures for this sordid practice are around 3,000 per year. Unofficial estimates suggest that the tally may be even higher. Most victims are known to be women aged between 15 and 24. Another 15-20 per cent of cases involve young men. About 65 per cent of known cases involve those of Pakistani origin, another 25 per cent are of Bangladeshi origin, and the rest are of Indian or various African and Eastern European origins. Individual stories are heart-rending, with many of the \u2018husbands\u2019 extraordinarily violent and abusive to the victims. The British government and Parliament have now begun taking this issue seriously. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has put up a website on this problem of forced marriages, giving links to groups and helplines run by people, including former victims, who have specific experience in the field. Annually, the FCO\u2019s Forced Marriage Unit website receives about 5,000 inquiries and currently helps about 400 victims; some British diplomatic missions abroad have taken victims into safe custody for repatriation to the United Kingdom.\nLegislation raises awkward issues. Although forced marriage itself is not a British criminal offence, the violent actions that often ensue are criminal offences, and any non-consensual sex is of course rape. Many victims have pointed out that they would not have been forced into marriage by their parents had forcible marriage been made a criminal offence. Yet there is the concern that if the practice is made a criminal offence, it would not be eliminated but only go underground, preventing legal action against this abhorrent trend. Hence the British government has proceeded cautiously in this regard. The English Forced Marriages (Civil Protection) Act 2007 is only a civil measure. But the pressure to take firm action is building. Visa regulations for young married people from abroad joining British spouses have been tightened. The British Parliament\u2019s Home Affairs Select Committee has suggested that the subjects of forced marriages and honour killings be made a compulsory part of the sex and relationships curriculum in schools. Other agencies in the U.K. are now becoming aware of this problem. But this awareness must translate into concerted efforts to stop forced marriages, which are nothing but the criminal abuse of hapless women.\n6 months ago","id":"<urn:uuid:0095fff2-a205-4d2c-8382-6f40c8021d1a>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/spoonfeedin.blogspot.com\/2008\/10\/world-britainforced-marriages.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9717975259,"token_count":513,"score":2.65625,"int_score":3}

Machines are powered devices, usually mechanically, chemically, thermally or electrically powered, and are frequently motorized. Historically, a device required moving parts to classify as a machine; however, the advent of electronics technology has led to the development of devices without moving parts that are considered machines.\nThe word \"machine\" is derived from the Latin word machina, which in turn derives from the Doric Greek \u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac (machana), Ionic Greek \u03bc\u03b7\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae (mechane) \"contrivance, machine, engine\" and that from \u03bc\u1fc6\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 (mechos), \"means, expedient, remedy\". The meaning of machine is traced by the Oxford English Dictionary to an independently functioning structure and by Merriam-Webster Dictionary to something that has been constructed. This includes human design into the meaning of machine.\nA simple machine is a device that simply transforms the direction or magnitude of a force, but a large number of more complex machines exist. Examples include vehicles, electronic systems, molecular machines, computers, television and radio.\n|This section requires expansion.|\nPerhaps the first example of a human made device designed to manage power is the hand axe, made by chipping flint to form a wedge. A wedge is a simple machine that transforms lateral force and movement of the tool into a transverse splitting force and movement of the workpiece.\nThe idea of a \"simple machine\" originated with the Greek philosopher Archimedes around the 3rd century BC, who studied the \"Archimedean\" simple machines: lever, pulley, and screw. He discovered the principle of mechanical advantage in the lever. Later Greek philosophers defined the classic five simple machines (excluding the inclined plane) and were able to roughly calculate their mechanical advantage. Heron of Alexandria (ca. 10\u201375 AD) in his work Mechanics lists five mechanisms that can \"set a load in motion\"; lever, windlass, pulley, wedge, and screw, and describes their fabrication and uses. However the Greeks' understanding was limited to the statics of simple machines; the balance of forces, and did not include dynamics; the tradeoff between force and distance, or the concept of work.\nDuring the Renaissance the dynamics of the Mechanical Powers, as the simple machines were called, began to be studied from the standpoint of how much useful work they could perform, leading eventually to the new concept of mechanical work. In 1586 Flemish engineer Simon Stevin derived the mechanical advantage of the inclined plane, and it was included with the other simple machines. The complete dynamic theory of simple machines was worked out by Italian scientist Galileo Galilei in 1600 in Le Meccaniche (\"On Mechanics\"). He was the first to understand that simple machines do not create energy, only transform it.\nThe classic rules of sliding friction in machines were discovered by Leonardo Da Vinci (1452\u20131519), but remained unpublished in his notebooks. They were rediscovered by Guillaume Amontons (1699) and were further developed by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb (1785).\n|Simple machines||Inclined plane, Wheel and axle, Lever, Pulley, Wedge, Screw|\n|Mechanical components||Axle, Bearings, Belts, Bucket, Fastener, Gear, Key, Link chains, Rack and pinion, Roller chains, Rope, Seals, Spring, Wheel|\n|Clock||Atomic clock, Chronometer, Pendulum clock, Quartz clock|\n|Compressors and Pumps||Archimedes' screw, Eductor-jet pump, Hydraulic ram, Pump, Trompe, Vacuum pump|\n|Heat engines||External combustion engines||Steam engine, Stirling engine|\n|Internal combustion engines||Reciprocating engine, Gas turbine|\n|Heat pumps||Absorption refrigerator, Thermoelectric refrigerator, Regenerative cooling|\n|Linkages||Pantograph, Cam, Peaucellier-Lipkin|\n|Turbine||Gas turbine, Jet engine, Steam turbine, Water turbine, Wind generator, Windmill|\n|Aerofoil||Sail, Wing, Rudder, Flap, Propeller|\n|Electronic devices||Vacuum tube, Transistor, Diode, Resistor, Capacitor, Inductor, Memristor, Semiconductor, Computer|\n|Robots||Actuator, Servo, Servomechanism, Stepper motor, Computer|\n|Miscellaneous||Vending machine, Wind tunnel, Check weighing machines, Riveting machines|\nThe idea that a machine can be broken down into simple movable elements led Archimedes to define the lever, pulley and screw as simple machines. By the time of the Renaissance this list increased to include the wheel and axle, wedge and inclined plane.\nAn engine or motor is a machine designed to convert energy into useful mechanical motion. Heat engines, including internal combustion engines and external combustion engines (such as steam engines) burn a fuel to create heat which is then used to create motion. Electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical motion, pneumatic motors use compressed air and others, such as wind-up toys use elastic energy. In biological systems, molecular motors like myosins in muscles use chemical energy to create motion.\nAn electrical machine is the generic name for a device that converts mechanical energy to electrical energy, converts electrical energy to mechanical energy, or changes alternating current from one voltage level to a different voltage level.\nElectronics is the branch of physics, engineering and technology dealing with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies. The nonlinear behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible and is usually applied to information and signal processing. Similarly, the ability of electronic devices to act as switches makes digital information processing possible. Interconnection technologies such as circuit boards, electronics packaging technology, and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed components into a working system.\nCharles Babbage designed various machines to tabulate logarithms and other functions in 1837. His Difference engine is the first mechanical calculator. This machine is considered to be the forerunner of the modern computer though none of them were built in his lifetime.\nStudy of the molecules and proteins that are the basis of biological functions has led to the concept of a molecular machine. For example, current models of the operation of the kinesin molecule that transports vesicles inside the cell as well as the myocin molecule that operates against actin to cause muscle contraction; these molecules control movement in response to chemical stimuli.\nResearchers in nano-technology are working to construct molecules that perform movement in response to a specific stimulus. In contrast to molecules such as kinesin and myosin, these nano-machines or molecular machines are constructions like traditional machines that are designed to perform in a task.\nMachines are assembled from standardized types of components. These elements consist of mechanisms that control movement in various ways such as gear trains, transistor switches, belt or chain drives, linkages, cam and follower systems, brakes and clutches, and structural components such as frame members and fasteners.\nModern machines include sensors, actuators and computer controllers. The shape, texture and color of covers provide a styling and operational interface between the mechanical components of a machine and its users.\nAssemblies within a machine that control movement are often called \"mechanisms.\"  Mechanisms are generally classified as gears and gear trains, cam and follower mechanisms, and linkages, though there are other special mechanisms such as clamping linkages, indexing mechanisms and friction devices such as brakes and clutches.\nControllers combine sensors, logic, and actuators to maintain the performance of components of a machine. Perhaps the best known is the flyball governor for a steam engine. Examples of these devices range from a thermostat that as temperature rises opens a valve to cooling water to speed controllers such the cruise control system in an automobile. The programmable logic controller replaced relays and specialized control mechanisms with a programmable computer. Servomotors that accurately position a shaft in response to an electrical command are the actuators that make robotic systems possible.\nDesign plays an important role in all three of the major phases of a product lifecycle:\nThe Industrial Revolution was a period from 1750 to 1850 where changes in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, transportation, and technology had a profound effect on the social, economic and cultural conditions of the times. It began in the United Kingdom, then subsequently spread throughout Western Europe, North America, Japan, and eventually the rest of the world.\nStarting in the later part of the 18th century, there began a transition in parts of Great Britain's previously manual labour and draft-animal\u2013based economy towards machine-based manufacturing. It started with the mechanisation of the textile industries, the development of iron-making techniques and the increased use of refined coal.\nMechanization or mechanisation (BE) is providing human operators with machinery that assists them with the muscular requirements of work or displaces muscular work. In some fields, mechanization includes the use of hand tools. In modern usage, such as in engineering or economics, mechanization implies machinery more complex than hand tools and would not include simple devices such as an un-geared horse or donkey mill. Devices that cause speed changes or changes to or from reciprocating to rotary motion, using means such as gears, pulleys or sheaves and belts, shafts, cams and cranks, usually are considered machines. After electrification, when most small machinery was no longer hand powered, mechanization was synonymous with motorized machines.\nAutomation is the use of control systems and information technologies to reduce the need for human work in the production of goods and services. In the scope of industrialization, automation is a step beyond mechanization. Whereas mechanization provides human operators with machinery to assist them with the muscular requirements of work, automation greatly decreases the need for human sensory and mental requirements as well. Automation plays an increasingly important role in the world economy and in daily experience.\nAn automaton (plural: automata or automatons) is a self-operating machine. The word is sometimes used to describe a robot, more specifically an autonomous robot. An alternative spelling, now obsolete, is automation.\n|Wikimedia Commons has media related to: Machines|\nThe World News (WN) Network, has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to user privacy.

{"text":"The Operations Layer defines the operational processes and procedures necessary to deliver Information Technology (IT) as a Service. This layer leverages IT Service Management concepts that can be found in prevailing best practices such as ITIL and MOF. The main focus of the Operations Layer is to execute the business requirements defined at the Service Delivery Layer. Cloud-like service attributes cannot be achieved through technology alone and require a high level of IT Service Management maturity.\nChange Management process is responsible for controlling the life cycle of all changes. The primary objective of Change Management is to eliminate or at least minimize disruption while desired changes are made to services. Change Management focuses on understanding and balancing the cost and risk of making the change versus the benefit of the change to either the business or the service. Driving predictability and minimizing human involvement are the core principles for achieving a mature Service Management process and ensuring changes can be made without impacting the perception of continuous availability.\nStandard (Automated) Change\nNon-Standard (Mechanized) Change\nIt is important to note that a record of all changes must be maintained, including Standard Changes that have been automated. The automated process for Standard Changes should include the creation and population of the change record per standard policy in order to make sure auditability.\nAutomating changes also enables other key principles such as:\nThe Service Asset and Configuration Management process is responsible for maintaining information on the assets, components, and infrastructure needed to provide a service. Critical configuration data for each component, and its relationship to other components, must be accurately captured and maintained. This configuration data should include past and current states and future-state forecasts, and be easily available to those who need it. Mature Service Asset and Configuration Management processes are necessary for achieving predictability.\nA virtualized infrastructure adds complexity to the management of Configuration Items (CIs) due to the transient nature of the relationship between guests and hosts in the infrastructure. How is the relationship between CIs maintained in an environment that is potentially changing very frequently?\nA service comprises software, platform, and infrastructure layers. Each layer provides a level of abstraction that is dependent on the layer beneath it. This abstraction hides the implementation and composition details of the layer. Access to the layer is provided through an interface and as long as the fabric is available, the actual physical location of a hosted VM is irrelevant. To provide Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), the configuration and relationship of the components within the fabric must be understood, whereas the details of the configuration within the VMs hosted by the fabric are irrelevant.\nThe Configuration Management System (CMS) will need to be partitioned, at a minimum, into physical and logical CI layers. Two Configuration Management Databases (CMDBs) might be used; one to manage the physical CIs of the fabric (facilities, network, storage, hardware, and hypervisor) and the other to manage the logical CIs (everything else). The CMS can be further partitioned by layer, with separate management of the infrastructure, platform, and software layers. The benefits and trade-offs of each approach are summarized below.\nCMS Partitioned by Layer\nCMS Partitioned into Physical and Logical\nTable 2: Configuration Management System Options\nPartitioning logical and physical CI information allows for greater stability within the CMS, because CIs will need to be changed less frequently. This means less effort will need to be expended to accurately maintain the information. During normal operations, mapping a VM to its physical host is irrelevant. If historical records of a VM\u2019s location are needed, (for example, for auditing or Root Cause Analysis) they can be traced through change logs.\nThe physical or fabric CMDB will need to include a mapping of fault domains, upgrade domains, and Live Migration domains. The relationship of these patterns to the infrastructure CIs will provide critical information to the Fabric Management System.\nThe Release and Deployment Management processes are responsible for making sure that approved changes to a service can be built, tested, and deployed to meet specifications with minimal disruption to the service and production environment. Where Change Management is based on the approval mechanism (determining what will be changed and why), Release and Deployment Management will determine how those changes will be implemented.\nThe primary focus of Release and Deployment Management is to protect the production environment. The less variation is found in the environment, the greater the level of predictability \u2013 and, therefore, the lower the risk of causing harm when new elements are introduced. The concept of homogenization of physical infrastructure is derived from this predictability principle. If the physical infrastructure is completely homogenized, there is much greater predictability in the release and deployment process.\nWhile complete homogenization is the ideal, it may not be achievable in the real world. Homogenization is a continuum. The closer an environment gets to complete homogeneity, the more predictable it becomes and the fewer the risks. Full homogeneity means not only that identical hardware models are used, but all hardware configuration is identical as well. When complete hardware homogeneity is not feasible, strive for configuration homogeneity wherever possible.\nFigure 2: Homogenization Continuum\nThe Scale Unit concept drives predictability in Capacity Planning and agility in the release and deployment of physical infrastructure. The hardware specifications and configurations have been pre-defined and tested, allowing for a more rapid deployment cycle than in a traditional data center. Similarly, known quantities of resources are added to the data center when the Capacity Plan is triggered. However, when the Scale Unit itself must change (for example, when a vendor retires a hardware model), a new risk is introduced to the private cloud.\nThere will likely be a period where both n and n-1 versions of the Scale Unit exist in the infrastructure, but steps can be taken to minimize the risk this creates. Work with hardware vendors to understand the life cycle of their products and coordinate changes from multiple vendors to minimize iterations of the Scale Unit change. Also, upgrading to the new version of the Scale Unit should take place one Fault Domain at a time wherever possible. This will make sure that if an incident occurs with the new version, it can be isolated to a single Fault Domain.\nHomogenization of the physical infrastructure means consistency and predictability for the VMs regardless of which physical host they reside on. This concept can be extended beyond the production environment. The fabric can be partitioned into development, test, and pre-production environments as well. Eliminating variability between environments enables developers to more easily optimize applications for a private cloud and gives testers more confidence that the results reflect the realities of production, which in turn should greatly improve testing efficiency.\nThe virtualized infrastructure enables workloads to be transferred more easily between environments. All VMs should be built from a common set of component templates housed in a library, which is used across all environments. This shared library includes templates for all components approved for production, such as VM images, the gold OS image, server role templates, and platform templates. These component templates are downloaded from the shared library and become the building blocks of the development environment. From development, these components are packaged together to create a test candidate package (in the form of a virtual hard disk (VHD) that is uploaded to the library. This test candidate package can then be deployed by booting the VHD in the test environment. When testing is complete, the package can again be uploaded to the library as a release candidate package \u2013 for deployment into the pre-production environment, and ultimately into the production environment.\nSince workloads are deployed by booting a VM from a VHD, the Release Management process occurs very quickly through the transfer of VHD packages to different environments. This also allows for rapid rollback should the deployment fail; the current release can be deleted and the VM can be booted off the previous VHD.\nVirtualization and the use of standard VM templates allow us to rethink software updates and patch management. As there is minimal variation in the production environment and all services in production are built with a common set of component templates, patches need not be applied in production. Instead, they should be applied to the templates in the shared library. Any services in production using that template will require a new version release. The release package is then rebuilt, tested, and redeployed, as shown below.\nFigure 3: The Release Process\nThis may seem counter-intuitive for a critical patch scenario, such as when an exploitable vulnerability is exposed. But with virtualization technologies and automated test scripts, a new version of a service can be built, tested, and deployed quite rapidly.\nVariation can also be reduced through standardized, automated test scenarios. While not every test scenario can or should be automated, tests that are automated will improve predictability and facilitate more rapid test and deployment timelines. Test scenarios that are common for all applications, or the ones that might be shared by certain application patterns, are key candidates for automation. These automated test scripts may be required for all release candidates prior to deployment and would make sure further reduction in variation in the production environment.\nKnowledge Management is the process of gathering, analyzing, storing, and sharing knowledge and information within an organization. The goal of Knowledge Management is to make sure that the right people have access to the information they need to maintain a private cloud. As operational knowledge expands and matures, the ability to intelligently automate operational tasks improves, providing for an increasingly dynamic environment.\nAn immature approach to Knowledge Management costs organizations in terms of slower, less-efficient problem solving. Every problem or new situation that arises becomes a crisis that must be solved. A few people may have the prior experience to resolve the problem quickly and calmly, but their knowledge is not shared. Immature knowledge management creates greater stress for the operations staff and usually results in user dissatisfaction with frequent and lengthy unexpected outages. Mature Knowledge Management processes are necessary for achieving a service provider\u2019s approach to delivering infrastructure. Past knowledge and experience is documented, communicated, and readily available when needed. Operating teams are no longer crisis-driven as service-impacting events grow less frequent and are quickly resolves when they do occur.\nWhen designing a private cloud, development of the Health Model will drive much of the information needed for Knowledge Management. The Health Model defines the ideal states for each infrastructure component and the daily, weekly, monthly, and as-needed tasks required to maintain this state. The Health Model also defines unhealthy states for each infrastructure component and actions to be taken to restore their health. This information will form the foundation of the Knowledge Management database.\nAligning the Health Model with alerts allows these alerts to contain links to the Knowledge Management database describing the specific steps to be taken in response to the alert. This will help drive predictability as a consistent, proven set of actions will be taken in response to each alert.\nThe final step toward achieving a private cloud is the automation of responses to each alert as defined in the Knowledge Management database. Once these responses are proven successful, they should be automated to the fullest extent possible. It is important to note, though, that automating responses to alerts does not make them invisible and forgotten. Even when alerts generate a fully automated response they must be captured in the Service Management system. If the alert indicates the need for a change, the change record should be logged. Similarly, if the alert is in response to an incident, an incident record should be created. These automated workflows must be reviewed regularly by Operations staff to make sure the automated action achieves the expected result. Finally, as the environment changes over time, or as new knowledge is gained, the Knowledge Management database must be updated along with the automated workflows that are based on that knowledge.\nThe goal of Incident Management is to resolve events that are impacting, or threaten to impact, services as quickly as possible with minimal disruption. The goal of Problem Management is to identify and resolve root causes of incidents that have occurred as well as identify and prevent or minimize the impact of incidents that may occur.\nPinpointing the root cause of an incident can become more challenging when workloads are abstracted from the infrastructure and their physical location changes frequently. Additionally, incident response teams may be unfamiliar with virtualization technologies (at least initially) which could also lead to delays in incident resolution. Finally, applications may have neither a robust Health Model nor expose all of the health information required for a proactive response. All of this may lead to an increase in reactive (user initiated) incidents which will likely increase the Mean-Time-to-Restore-Service (MTRS) and customer dissatisfaction.\nThis may seem to go against the resiliency principle, but note that virtualization alone will not achieve the desired resiliency unless accompanied by highly mature IT Service Management (ITSM) maturity and a robust automated health monitoring system.\nThe drive for resiliency requires a different approach to troubleshooting incidents. Extensive troubleshooting of incidents in production negatively impacts resiliency. Therefore, if an incident cannot be quickly resolved, the service can be rolled back to the previous version, as described under Release and Deployment. Further troubleshooting can be done in a test environment without impacting the production environment. Troubleshooting in the production environment may be limited to moving the service to different hosts (ruling out infrastructure as the cause) and rebooting the VMs. If these steps do not resolve the issue, the rollback scenario could be initiated.\nMinimizing human involvement in incident management is critical for achieving resiliency. The troubleshooting scenarios described earlier could be automated, which will allow for identification and possible resolution of the root much more quickly than non-automated processes. But automation may mask the root cause of the incident. Careful consideration should be given to determining which troubleshooting steps should be automated and which require human analysis.\nHuman Analysis of Troubleshooting\nIf a compute resource fails, it is no longer necessary to treat the failure as an incident that must be fixed immediately. It may be more efficient and cost effective to treat the failure as part of the decay of the Resource Pool. Rather than treat a failed server as an incident that requires immediate resolution, treat it as a natural candidate for replacement on a regular maintenance schedule, or when the Resource Pool reaches a certain threshold of decay. Each organization must balance cost, efficiency, and risk as it determines an acceptable decay threshold \u2013 and choose among these courses of action:\nThe benefits and trade-off of each of the options are listed below:\nOption 4 is the least desirable, as it does not take advantage of the resiliency and cost reduction benefits of a private cloud. A well-planned Resource Pool and Reserve Capacity strategy will account for Resource Decay.\nOption 1 is the most recommended approach. A predictable maintenance schedule allows for better procurement planning and can help avoid conflicts with other maintenance activities, such as software upgrades. Again, a well-planned Resource Pool and Reserve Capacity strategy will account for Resource Decay and minimize the risk of exceeding critical thresholds before the scheduled maintenance.\nOption 3 will likely be the only option for self-contained Scale Unit scenarios, as the container must be replaced as a single Scale Unit when the decay threshold is reached.\nThe goal of Request Fulfillment is to manage requests for service from users. Users should have a clear understanding of the process they need to initiate to request service and IT should have a consistent approach for managing these requests.\nMuch like any service provider, IT should clearly define the types of requests available to users in the service catalog. The service catalog should include an SLA on when the request will be completed, as well as the cost of fulfilling the request, if any.\nThe types of requests available and their associated costs should reflect the actual cost of completing the request and this cost should be easily understood. For example, if a user requests an additional VM, its daily cost should be noted on the request form, which should also be exposed to the organization or person responsible for paying the bill.\nIt is relatively easy to see the need for adding resources, but more difficult to see when a resource is no longer needed. A process for identifying and removing unused VMs should be put into place. There are a number of strategies to do this, depending on the needs of a given organization, such as:\nThe benefits and trade-offs of each of these approaches are detailed below:\nOption 4 affords the greatest flexibility, while still working to minimize server sprawl. When a user requests a VM, they have the option of setting an expiration date with no reminder (for example, if they know they will only be using the workload for one week). They could set an expiration deadline with a reminder (for example, a reminder that the VM will expire after 90 days unless they wish to renew). Lastly, the user may request no expiration date if they expect the workload will always be needed. If the last option is chosen, it is likely that underutilized VMs will still be monitored and owners notified.\nFinally, self-provisioning should be considered, if appropriate, when evaluating request fulfillment options to drive towards minimal human involvement. Self-provisioning allows great agility and user empowerment, but it can also introduce risks depending on the nature of the environment in which these VMs are introduced.\nFor an enterprise organization, the risk of bypassing formal build, stabilize, and deploy processes may or may not outweigh the agility benefits gained from the self-provisioning option. Without strong governance to make sure each VM has an end-of-life strategy, the fabric may become congested with VM server sprawl. The pros and cons of self-provisioning options are listed in the next diagram:\nThe primary decision point for determining whether to use self-provisioning is the nature of the environment. Allowing developers to self-provision into the development environment greatly facilitates agile development, and allows the enterprise to maintain release management controls as these workloads are moved out of development and into test and production environments.\nA user-led community environment isolated from enterprise mission-critical applications may also be a good candidate for self-provisioning. As long as user actions are isolated and cannot impact mission critical applications, the agility and user empowerment may justify the risk of giving up control of release management. Again, it is essential that in such a scenario, expiration timers are included to prevent server sprawl.\nThe goal of Access Management is to make sure authorized users have access to the services they need while preventing access by unauthorized users. Access Management is the implementation of security policies defined by Information Security Management at the Service Delivery Layer.\nMaintaining access for authorized users is critical for achieving the perception of continuous availability. Besides allowing access, Access Management defines users who are allowed to use, configure, or administer objects in the Management Layer. From a provider\u2019s perspective, it answers questions like:\nFrom a consumer\u2019s perspective, it answers questions such as:\nAccess Management is implemented at several levels and can include physical barriers to systems such as requiring access smartcards at the data center, or virtual barriers such as network and Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) separation, firewalling, and access to storage and applications.\nTaking a service provider\u2019s approach to Access Management will also make sure that resource segmentation and multi-tenancy is addressed.\nResource Pools may need to be segmented to address security concerns around confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Some tenants may not wish to share infrastructure resources to keep their environment isolated from others. Access Management of shared infrastructure requires logical access control mechanisms such as encryption, access control rights, user groupings, and permissions. Dedicated infrastructure also relies on physical access control mechanisms, where infrastructure is not physically connected, but is effectively isolated through a firewall or other mechanisms.\nThe goal of systems administration is to make sure that the daily, weekly, monthly, and as-needed tasks required to keep a system healthy are being performed.\nRegularly performing ongoing systems administration tasks is critical for achieving predictability. As the organization matures and the Knowledge Management database becomes more robust and increasingly automated, systems administration tasks is no longer part of the job role function. It is important to keep this in mind as an organization moves to a private cloud. Staff once responsible for systems administration should refocus on automation and scripting skills \u2013 and on monitoring the fabric to identify patterns that indicate possibilities for ongoing improvement of existing automated workflows.","id":"<urn:uuid:809862ce-ee94-40a5-8400-9b6e42bd25fc>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/social.technet.microsoft.com\/wiki\/contents\/articles\/4518.private-cloud-planning-guide-for-operations.aspx","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9264841676,"token_count":4173,"score":2.640625,"int_score":3}

In a population of adult animals, most will be around the same size. A few will be larger and a few will be smaller.\n\"If you talk to statisticians,\" noted Dr. Russell Judge of the University of Alabama in Huntsville, \"variations within populations in nature can be described in terms of distributions.\"\nDecember 3: Mars Polar Lander nears touchdown\nDecember 2: What next, Leonids?\nNovember 30: Polar Lander Mission Overview\nNovember 30: Learning how to make a clean sweep in space\nThe question now is whether scientists can use the microgravity of space to shift the curve to the right to grow the large, nearly perfect crystals they need for molecular lock-picking, the first step in designing drugs that can treat a broad range of diseases and disorders.\n\"We want to determine how the growth of crystals effect their quality,\" Judge said in May when NASA selected his investigation for development, \"and then take that into space to see how microgravity is enhancing the growth characteristics that lead to good crystals. From this we want to develop techniques, so that by observing crystal growth on the ground, we can predict which proteins are likely to benefit the most from microgravity crystallization.\"\nSign up for our EXPRESS SCIENCE NEWS delivery\nThese functions are a result not just of a chemical formula, but of structure which can be quite large (on the atomic scale) and fragile. If the shape isn't right, the protein cannot match up with other proteins or chemicals to do its job, just as the wrong key won't unlock a door. Sickle cell anemia, for example, results from structural differences in the hemoglobin that carries oxygen in red blood cells. Designing new treatments means designing altered proteins or other chemicals that act as a skeleton key or as a sophisticated lock pick.\nProteins can form crystals, generated by rows and columns of molecules that form up like soldiers on a parade ground. Shining X-rays through a crystal will produce a pattern of dots that can be decoded to reveal the arrangement of the atoms in the molecules making up the crystal. Like the troops in formation, uniformity and order are everything in X-ray crystallography. X-rays have much sorter wavelengths than visible light, so the best looking crystals under the microscope won't necessarily pass muster under X-rays.\nLeft: Judge (left) and Dr. Edward Snell, a National Research Council fellow working at NASA\/Marshall, inspect the sample holder in the X-ray crystallography unit.

But many proteins remain shrouded in mystery because on Earth crystal imperfections are introduced by fluid flows and the settling of the crystals to the bottom of the container. This leaves internal defects that distort or blur the view of the structure.\n\"In order to have crystals to use for X-ray diffraction studies,\" Judge said, \"you need them to be fairly large and well ordered.\" Scientists also need lots of crystals since exposure to air, the process of X-raying them, and other factors destroy the crystals. Getting just one perfect specimen isn't enough. Dozens may be needed, and the quality might not be known until well into the analysis.\nResearch has Heavy Implications. July 1998. Crystal-clear\nview of insulin should lead to improved therapies for diabetics\nGrowing protein crystals in the microgravity of space has yielded striking results, such as determining to a fine resolution how certain molecules of insulin join so scientists can improve injectable insulin needed by diabetics. There have also been disappointments when crystals in other experiments did not grow as expected.\nSince the 1970s, scientists have used a variety of approaches in trying to determine what leads to the growth of a large, perfect crystal. Judge tried a different approach that built on results noted by researchers dating as far back as 1946.\nHe and his team looked at the effects of concentration, temperature, and pH (acid vs. base) on the growth of lysozyme, a common protein in chicken egg white. Lysozyme's structure is well known and it has become a standard in many crystallization studies on Earth and in space. Although lysozyme has an atomic mass of 14,300 Daltons - almost 92 times that of the ordinary sugar that many of us crystallized in elementary school science - it's a relative lightweight in the protein world.\nTo exclude impurities often found in commercial lysozyme preparations, Judge and his team purified lysozyme extracted from eggs obtained from a local egg farm. While one experiment run required only five dozen eggs, the full series of experiment consumed about 200 eggs.\nJudge and his team grew the crystals in trays with small plastic wells filled with solutions containing a trace of salt to help stimulate crystal growth. Temperatures ranged from 4 to 18 deg C (39-64 deg F) and pH from 4.0 to 5.2 (slightly acidic; pure water theoretically has a pH of 7). Judge also varied the driving force behind the crystal growth process, called supersaturation, by varying the initial concentration of protein. Protein concentration must be set above a critical limit, the solubility, in order to form crystals (below this concentrations the protein stays dissolved and never forms crystals)\nLeft: A bell curve for lysozyme crystals produced in Judge's experiments, and a possible shift in the curve that microgravity experiments might produce.

It turned out that the solution pH had the largest effect on the growth of the crystals, possibly due to changes in charges on the surface of the molecules.\nWhen solution conditions had been optimized to give a small number of large crystals, a sample of 50 crystals was withdrawn for X-ray diffraction analysis.\nJudge hoped that when the ideal conditions were found and then applied to subsequent batches, he would be able to grow consistently large, high quality crystals of lysozyme. The expectation was that with ideal conditions, quality crystals could be cranked out as if in a factory.\nInstead, nature put him on the curve.\n\"Some variation is occurring there,\" Judge said, \"but we haven't quite pinpointed the cause.\"\nJudge got a bell curve when he measured the X-ray clarity, properly called the signal-to-noise ratio (a radio with static has a low signal-to-noise ratio). A graph of the number of crystals versus the signal-to-noise ratio forms a bell curve, albeit slightly skewed to one side.\nRight: Distribution of diffraction characteristics - essentially a measure of quality - for a batch of crystals approximates a bell curve. Links to 875x637-pixel, 66KB JPG. Credit: NASA\/Marshall.\n\"The distribution is saying a very few crystals form perfectly in solution,\" he continued, \"and a small number are really poor. The majority of crystals are in-between.\"\nIt's doubly puzzling because the crystals were grown from the same batch of lysozyme that was poured into 120 wells in the experiment tray and crystallized under the same conditions.\n\"We have some ideas,\" Judge said, \"but we haven't tested them yet, so we're hesitant to say it might be this or that.\"\nThe research will continue with insulin, the crucial protein that conveys sugar from the blood stream into a body's cells, and with glucose isomerase, a larger (46,000 Daltons) protein used in industrial processes to convert glucose to a sweeter sugar called fructose.\nLeft: Crystals of insulin grown in space let scientists determine the vital enzyme's structure and linkages with much higher resolution that Earth-grown crystals had allowed.

Larger format versions of these and related images are available from the NASA Image Exchange and using the keyword \"insulin.\" Credit: NASA\/Marshall.\n\"In all of the proteins we're using the structure is pretty well known,\" Judge added.\nIn addition to ground-based experiments, Judge hopes to conduct flight experiments in the next year or so. He would use the Vapor Diffusion Apparatus, a device developed by the University of Alabama in Birmingham and well-proven in a number of Space Shuttle flights.\n\"Most researchers say that crystals grown in microgravity will be better than those on the ground,\" Judge said. And a number of experiments bear out that belief. \"Somehow, microgravity pushes up the end of the distribution curve.\"\nRight: Crystals of glucose isomerase, a larger molecular weight protein, will be grown to see if they, too, are graded \"on the curve.\" Links to 1018x749-pixel, 365KB JPG. Credit: NASA\/Marshall.\nWith expected flight experiments on lysozyme, insulin and glucose isomerase, Judge will have crystals grown in conditions as close as possible to the ideal conditions he had determined so far. At the same time, he will grow crystals on Earth from the same mix as the flight batch and using identical hardware and conditions so that microgravity is the only variable.\nEventually, he hopes that his studies will lead to a tool for screening candidate proteins for flight.\nThe Effect of Temperature and Solution pH on the Nucleation of Tetragonal Lysozyme Crystals.

In this respect an understanding of the effect of solution conditions on macromolecule nucleation rates is advantageous. This study investigated the effects of supersaturation, temperature, and pH on the nucleation rate of tetragonal lysozyme crystals. Batch crystallization plates were prepared at given solution concentrations and incubated at set temperatures over 1 week. The number of crystals per well with their size and axial ratios were recorded and correlated with solution conditions. Crystal numbers were found to increase with increasing supersaturation and temperature. The most significant variable, however, was pH; crystal numbers changed by two orders of magnitude over the pH range 4.0-5.2. Crystal size also varied with solution conditions, with the largest crystals obtained at pH 5.2. Having optimized the crystallization conditions, we prepared a batch of crystals under the same initial conditions, and 50 of these crystals were analyzed by x-ray diffraction techniques. The results indicate that even under the same crystallization conditions, a marked variation in crystal properties exists.\nMore Space Science Headlines - NASA research on the web\nLife and Microgravity Sciences and Applications information from NASA HQ on science in space\nMicrogravity Research Programs Office headquartered at Marshall Space Flight Center\nMicrogravity News online version of NASA's latest in Microgravity advancements, published quarterly.\nJoin our growing list of subscribers - sign up for our express news delivery and you will receive a mail message every time we post a new story!!!\nFor more information, please contact:|\nDr. John M.

Other thesis, University of Muhammadiyah Malang.\nDownload (58Kb) | Preview\nReligiosity is an appreciation, confidence, experience or individual conscience against religious teachings are realized in practice worship and religious rituals. Terbinanya religiosity properly, can raises life satisfaction for the elderly. Where life satisfaction is a state which includes feelings of passion in it, have assertiveness and tough or resilient, the match between the desire to achievement of goals, have positive self concept, and mood calm. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between religiosity to life satisfaction in elderly. This study uses a quantitative approach. The subject of this research is the elderly who followed the routine recitation in boarding school Nurul Ulum. The sampling technique used is total sampling. With number of study subjects 50 people. Data collection methods used there are 2 kinds of scales are scales of religiosity and life satisfaction scale. Data collected and then analyzed by using correlation product moment using the computer program SPSS for Windows version 10. Results obtained from this study indicate that there is a relationship positive and highly significant correlation between religiosity to life satisfaction in advanced age (r = 0.419 p = 0.002). This means that the higher the religiosity which is owned the higher the person's life satisfaction, and vice versa the lower the religiosity of a person will get low life satisfaction. The effective contribution of religiosity to the satisfaction living elderly by 17.6%, while 82,4% influenced by other variables had not been examined.\n|Item Type:||Thesis (Other)|\n|Subjects:||B Philosophy.

{"text":"Uveitis is inflammation of the uvea, which is made up of the iris, ciliary body and choroid. Together, these form the middle layer of the eye between the retina and the sclera (white of the eye).\nThe eye is shaped like a tennis ball, with three different layers of tissue surrounding the central gel-filled cavity, which is called the vitreous. The innermost layer is the retina, which senses light and helps to send images to your brain. The outermost layer is the sclera, the strong white wall of the eye. The middle layer between the sclera and retina is called the uvea.\nThe uvea contains many blood vessels \u2014 the veins, arteries and capillaries \u2014 that carry blood to and from the eye. Because the uvea nourishes many important parts of the eye (such as the retina), inflammation of the uvea can damage your sight.\nThere are several types of uveitis, defined by the part of the eye where it occurs.\n- Iritis affects the front of your eye. Also called anterior uveitis, this is the most common type of uveitis. Iritis usually develops suddenly and may last six to eight weeks. Some types of anterior uveitis can be chronic or recurrent.\n- If the uvea is inflamed in the middle or intermediate region of the eye, it is called pars planitis (or intermediate uveitis). Episodes of pars planitis can last between a few weeks to years. The disease goes through cycles of getting better, then worse.\n- Posterior uveitis affects the back parts of your eye. Posterior uveitis can develop slowly and often lasts for many years.\n- Panuveitis occurs when all layers of the uvea are inflamed.\nNext Page: Uveitis Causes","id":"<urn:uuid:33687e0d-90f9-4e53-ac31-257283325d4f>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/eyecareamerica.org\/eyesmart\/diseases\/uveitis.cfm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9142661691,"token_count":389,"score":4.125,"int_score":4}
{"text":"Like the Sound of Music\u2018s Von Trapp family hiding in the Alps, plants may find refuge from a warming climate in the mountains.\nResearch in the Swiss Alps suggests diverse mountain habitats could act as stepping stones to allow plants to escape into more hospitable hideaways as their usual homes heat up.\nA large, flat savannah offers little variation in temperature. If the temperature warms up, the whole area warms up.\nBut Daniel Scherrer and Christian K\u00f6rner from the University of Basel, Switzerland found a broad spectrum of habitats in the central Swiss Alps after studying an alpine meadow for two seasons. In the rugged mountain landscape, different conditions existed close together.\nThe plants growing in those varied conditions were adapted to the particular set of temperatures of the micro-climates, the scientists found. The research suggests that these plants could start growing in neighboring habitats as the temperature increases.\nTo test this, Scherrer and K\u00f6rner used a computer model to simulate what would happen if the temperature went up 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. They found that only 3 percent of all temperature conditions disappeared. Some of the cooler habitats shrank or shifted, but pockets remained. This suggests that plants have the opportunity to shift habitats, instead of just dying off.\nPreserving mountain habitats is even more new important now in light of this research. A diverse Alpine meadow could save many different habitats, compared to a single habitat in a grassland of equal size.\n\u201cIt is known from earlier geological periods that mountains were always important for survival of species during periods of climatic change such as in glacial cycles, because of their \u2018habitat diversity,\u2019\u201d concluded K\u00f6rner.\n\u201cMountains are therefore particularly important areas for the conservation of biodiversity in a given region under climatic change and thus deserve particular protection,\u201d K\u00f6rner said.\nPhoto: Different habitats exist close together in the Alps.

{"text":"by Bruce Boyers,\nOur system of factory agriculture is exacting a great toll on our planet: 40 percent of the land and 70 percent of the fresh water on Earth is devoted to the growing of food, which, in the process, creates some 30 percent of greenhouse gases. Compounding these issues is the fact that commercial produce is often transported thousands or even tens of thousands of miles to its point of sale, consuming tons of fossil fuel. It is evident that our current agricultural model is a failed experiment in search of a more sustainable solution.\nIn an effort to bring needed fresh produce closer to home with far greater sustainability, a movement in urban agriculture is rapidly gaining momentum. New York City, having such a large and diverse population, is a metropolis ripe for green urban agriculture and is now home to an innovative commercial operation called Gotham Greens.\nGotham Greens has now gone into full production and is providing much-needed locally and sustainably grown produce for the greater New York City area. \"My partners and I had a vision for a local farm operation here in New York City that could provide New Yorkers-which would include restaurants, retailers and consumers-with premium quality, fresh, nutritious culinary herbs and greens, salad greens and lettuces,\" Puri said. \"They would be grown year round so that we could reliably and consistently supply our customers with local produce. Obviously our climate in New York doesn't support year-round agriculture of a lot of these crops, so we thought we would try to do something in a greenhouse. A greenhouse climate allows you to potentially grow year round, at the same time protecting crops against extreme or detrimental weather events.\"\nGotham Greens was founded in 2008 by Puri and Eric Haley; then in 2009 Jennifer Nelkin joined as a partner to head all greenhouse operations. Puri himself had previously developed and managed start-up enterprises in New York City, in Ladakh, India, and in Malawi, Africa, focusing on green building, renewable energy and environmental design. Haley, who is currently employed by a Manhattan-based investment bank and private equity fund, also brought business acumen to the operation. The farm know-how comes from Nelkin, who cultivated her expertise in greenhouse systems and management at the University of Arizona. In addition to greenhouse system design, her skillset includes plant nutrition and crop and pest management. She has managed greenhouses in far more extreme circumstances than New York-namely two different locations in Antarctica, providing fresh vegetables for US research scientists.\nHouse of Greens\nThe choice of a rooftop was made quite deliberately. \"New York City obviously doesn't have a lot of arable or available land, so it seemed to us that one underutilized resource was rooftops,\" said Puri. \"You're seeing more and more innovative uses of the rooftops now in urban areas nationwide.\"\nGetting a rooftop greenhouse up and operational-especially one of this size and scope-was no mean feat. \"It was extremely challenging,\" Puri recalled. \"I would say the biggest challenge was just having any real path to follow. There's not a lot of precedent for what we're doing.\n\"The first thing was finding a building owner who wouldn't mind us building a greenhouse on his or her roof. We also had to find a building that met all the construction criteria, both structurally and for the obtaining of utilities. In addition there had to be access, and the evaluation of how we would get stuff up and how we would get stuff down. On top of that we had to make sure the plan would meet all zoning and building codes.\"\nThe Gotham Greens operation, as one might imagine, represents an enormous saving in resource usage. \"We employ a recirculating hydroponic technique that actually goes back and captures all irrigation for reuse,\" Puri explained. \"It's the most water-efficient form of agriculture in the world. We use ten times less water than conventional agriculture. Even though we are not in an area that is susceptible to drought, we still think that it's a great demonstration of a technology that is very water efficient.\" The hydroponic growing environment is sterile as well, which eliminates the risk of pathogens-particularly important in light of the increase in foodborne illnesses, such as E. coli and salmonella, from fresh vegetables.\nPuri and his partners have seen to the frugal use of energy too. \"We have 55 kilowatts in solar panels that produce electricity to help meet the electrical needs of the facility,\" said Puri. \"Along with that, we've spent a lot of effort here to design our facilities to be as energy efficient as possible. We've installed increased insulation in many areas; the glazing material that we selected helps insulate the greenhouse; and we've deployed heat curtains and heat blankets in the winter to reduce space in the greenhouse that needs to be conditioned.\" Additionally, a sophisticated computer control system ensures that climate-control equipment operates efficiently to reduce resource consumption.\nPerhaps the most significant saving in terms of resources is that of fossil fuels, as the distance from farm to consumer is considerably shorter. \"Of course, we sharply reduce the transportation of our product and the associated carbon emissions that are caused because of that,\" Puri added.\nAll nutrition and pest control is done naturally and sustainably, which was also one of the goals for Gotham Greens. \"We utilize mineral salts that we dissolve in the water,\" Puri said. \"These contain minerals such as nitrogen, magnesium and potassium, along with micronutrients like selenium. In controlling pests, we mostly rely on beneficial insects; there's a whole program in integrated pest management for which a fair bit of monitoring goes on. If we do find a pest in here, we will introduce its natural predator-for instance, we have ladybugs and lacewings to control aphids.\"\nIt's in the Taste\nLike many others concentrating on great flavor, Puri and his team have found that truly caring for the plants will result in the superiority they seek. \"The biggest thing in obtaining that flavor is really taking care of our crops-making sure they have ideal growing conditions in climate, humidity, temperature, and so forth. We're also making sure they're getting all the nutrients that they need, along with the right amount of irrigation, the right amount of dissolved oxygen. The foremost belief is that healthy plants are going to make for tastier plants.\n\"And then because we are so close to our customers, we never have to harvest anything before it's completely ready. Many conventionally grown crops have to be refrigerated and transported long distances, so they are picked early and then artificially ripened. We don't have to do anything like that; we can harvest crops when they are at their optimal freshness, size, flavor, profile and color. We can harvest any item in the morning and have it to a supermarket or a restaurant in the afternoon.\"\nIn addition to supplying locally grown produce, Gotham Greens contributes to the local economy by providing badly needed jobs. All staff are residents from the nearby community. As production expands, they also plan to offer their products to more local areas that have limited access to fresh produce.\nThey're Buying It\nFor more information on Gotham Greens, visit www.gothamgreens.com.\n|Printable Version||E-mail a Friend|","id":"<urn:uuid:2451548b-a149-48b0-833a-9e93037b7cb3>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.westerlynaturalmarket.com\/promog\/featuredarticle.asp?storeID=QWCSN3N89ASR2JS000AKHMCCQAB04FN2&ID=12","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9691784382,"token_count":1507,"score":2.734375,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Italian Food & Cuisine History\nDespite the common American misconception, there is no typical approach when it comes to Italian cuisine. Instead, styles have developed over the centuries on the regional levels resulting in a multitude of customs and techniques. If there were to be a unifying theme in Italian cooking, however, it would have to be the utilization of fresh, seasonal ingredients. However, due to the diversity of climate and geography in Italy, even the available ingredients themselves are different from area to area.\nA good example of the regionalism of styles and ingredients can be found in the differences between northern and southern Italian cooking. Much of southern diet is influenced by its proximity to the Mediterranean Sea, resulting in its reliance on fresh fish such as tuna and swordfish. In addition, its abundance of seafood has caused the cooking style to be lighter and simpler, highlighting ingredients such as tomatoes and olive oil. This style has even been deemed by the Italian government as the \u201cMediterranean Cuisine\u201d.\nThe northern style however, replaces the southern reliance on fish with beef, pork, and dried beans which are more readily available in the region. In addition, the north uses butter and cream rather than olive oil as it\u2019s dominating cooking fat. The result is a tradition that is heavier and heartier than the southern provinces. It is worth mentioning that many of the new trends in Italian cuisine seen in America are actually part of this approach. Risotto, a savory rice dish which relies on the breakdown of starches to produce its characteristic creaminess, and polenta, a side dish made from corn meal, have long been mainstays of the northern Italian diet.\nDespite the popularity of these broader dishes to this country\u2019s restaurant scene, most Americans still associate Italian food with pasta and pizza. And while pasta does play an important role in Italian cuisine, it is much more versatile than just spaghetti and meatballs. Orzo, for example, is rice-shaped pasta that is seen often prepared as a side dish to beef or veal while gnocchi are potato dumplings often seen tossed in simple sauces that highlight their delicateness. Even heartier pastas are often paired with more than just marinara sauce. Examples of this are the northern-used Bolognese sauce, a meaty blend of tomatoes and cream, and the dramatically different pesto, a light blend of chopped basil, garlic, olive oil, and pine nuts.\nFinally, desserts play an important part of the Italian diet. Cannolis and tiramisu, both of which contain sweetened mascarpone fillings, are the most widely known in America though others have recently gained attention. For example, gelatos are similar to ice cream but differ in that they are served in a semi-frozen state which results in a creamier, smoother texture. For the more health-conscious, a granita might be preferred. Because of the absence of milk or cream, the final texture is coarser and more crystalline. On the other end of the dessert spectrum are those made with wine or alcohol. Zabaglione is an egg custard often times flavored with marsala or champagne which is often served with strawberries and zaletti, light cornmeal cookies.\nWe hope this overview has helped you to better understand the diversity of Italian cuisine.

{"text":"The pristine waters off Kona, Hawaii, teem with big game and spawn many exciting fish tales. But this tale is unlike any other, a mystery involving a giant slender fish discovered on the surface minus its head and tail, making it nearly impossible to identify.\nSea Strike Capt. Dale Leverone poses with giant headless mystery fish found recently off Kona, Hawaii. In below image, first mate Jack Leverone lies beside the 7-foot-long denizen. Credit: the Leverones\nThe case may never be solved because scientists have little to go on besides the photos accompanying this post, and because the fishermen filleted the carcass and tossed it overboard.\nThe only thing that appears certain is that the headless mystery fish belongs to a species that resides at great depth, and is rarely encountered by humans.\nThe best guess, and some might have already ventured this theory, is that this was an oarfish. Oarfish are long and slender prehistoric-looking fish believed to have spawned tales of sea serpents among ancient mariners.\nThat\u2019s what Capt. Dale Leverone of the Sea Strike, which stumbled upon the 7-foot-long ribbon-like fish, initially believed.\nThat\u2019s also what Jon Schwartz supposed. Schwartz, a fishing photographer and friends of the Leverone family, spent an entire day last week trying to solve this mystery, and blogged about his detective work. His title: \u201cGiant Headless Mystery Fish Baffles Fishermen and Scientists.\u201d\nBut oarfish boast crimson-colored mane-like dorsal fins, tall and prominent near their heads, and the headless fish did not have a detectable dorsal fin. \u201cI thought it was a car bumper, but then I remembered they don\u2019t float,\u201d first mate Jack Leverone told Schwartz.\nSchwartz contacted Jim Rizzuto, a veteran fishing writer in Hawaii, and Rizzuto suggested it could be a Hawaiian ridge scabbardfish, which are long and ribbon-like, and extremely rare. But scabbardfish do not get nearly this long, so it was crossed off the list.\nSchwartz plunged into Wikipedia and found a species called beltfish, which are long and thin, and a photo of a bunch of them at a fish market in Japan. Not a probable match.\nSchwartz also contacted two NOAA marine biologists, who could not provide a positive ID.\nI decided to probe on my own and contacted Perry Hampton, vice president of animal husbandry at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, Calif.\nHampton said the photographs \u201cdo not show enough detail to make a determination\u201d but added: \u201cDespite the apparent lack of red dorsal fin it is hard to come up with any other species other than an oarfish,\u201d based on the size of the specimen.\n\u201cThe most prominent part of an oarfish\u2019s dorsal fin are the first few spines near the head,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is possible that these things were lost along with the head.

{"text":"Breast cancer represents one of the most common cancers among women in the United States. Data indicates that more than 180,000 American women received a diagnosis of breast cancer in 2009. The various risk factors include: the female gender, heredity, genetic factors, aging and idiopathic causes.\nWhat You Should Know About Breast Cancer\nThe short answer to what you should know about breast cancer is that it\u2019s a malignant tumor in the breast tissue. With non-invasive breast cancer, the tumor stays localized and does not spread (metastasize) from its origin of growth. Experts refer to this as \u201cCarcinoma in Situ\u201d. The tumor occurs in and remains confined to the ducts (ductal carcinoma in situ) or confined to the lobules (lobular carcinoma in situ).\n\u201cDuct\u201d and \u201cLobules\u201d refer to the milk duct and the milk producing glands, respectively, in the mammary glands. Most breast cancers start in the ducts and spread to other tissues. Lobular carcinoma doesn\u2019t meet the criteria of a true cancer by itself, but is a marker for many other types of cancer \u2013 both invasive and non-invasive.\nAn invasive tumor spreads beyond its area of origin and can have three different stages of invasiveness \u2013 localized, regional and distant stages. As the names suggest localized types include those which remain localized to the breast tissues, the regional stage refers to the spread of the tumor to the tissues surrounding the breast (e.g. \u2013 lymph nodes) and the distant tumors are those that spread away from the breast to other tissues and organs. Needless to mention, patients with distant tumors are not easily managed.\nAbout Breast Cancer Stages\nDoctors base breast cancer stages on the tumor size, nodal status (involvement of lymph nodes) and degree of spread (metastasis) tumors are grouped into 5 stages \u2013 0 to IV. Stage zero means the carcinoma cells confined to the duct or lobule and has not spread elsewhere. This is the foremost stage of breast cancer.\nIn stage I the tumor is very small \u2013 less than or equal to 2 cm in diameter and is confined to an area in the breast, not spread to the lymph nodes or surrounding tissues. In stage II, the tumor grows to 1-2 inches in diameter and cancer cells appear at the lymph nodes. Sometimes the tumor is even bigger than 5cms, but the lymph nodes remain unaffected. In stage III, the tumor grows more than 5 cm and spreads to the lymph nodes and sometimes even to multiple lymph nodes, skin and chest wall. Stage IV is the last one and in this case the cancer spreads to somewhere else in the body.\nDiagnostic Tests for Breast Cancer\nA biopsy of the tumor determines the type of cancer. This enables the doctors to freeze on the treatment methods and also to figure out how quickly the cancer might grow. The hormone receptor status and HER2 status of the patient is also of prime importance to the doctors, because female hormones estrogen and progesterone play a vital role in the development of some cancer types. \u201cER+\u201d and \u201cPR+\u201d are, respectively, estrogen receptor positive and progesterone receptor positive tumors. Hormonal therapy has been found to be beneficial in patients with such tumors. HER2 status also influences the mode of treatment.\nTherapy and Treatment of Breast Cancer\nThe most widely used breast cancer treatment methods include mastectomy and lumpectomy procedures. The former refers to the removal of the entire affected breast through surgery and the latter refers to the removal of only the tumor and some surrounding tissues believed to contain the roots of the tumor.\nAs is the case with most cancer types, the cancer cells in breast cancer are too tiny for detection and doctors cannot rule out the chances that some cells will remain in the body, even after a successful surgery. The leftover cells can cause recurrence. To rule out recurrence adjuvant therapies are advised.\nSuch therapies include:\n- Hormonal therapy\n- Targeted biological therapy\nIn chemotherapy, the oncology health care team will administer a chemical to the patient (usually intravenously, but sometimes orally) to disrupt communication and growth of the cancerous cells. Hormonal therapy involves dosing the patient with a drug that works to bring down the estrogen levels or reduce its action.\nExperts believe estrogen promotes growth in some tumors. In targeted biological therapy, doctors inject the body with monoclonal antibodies trained to recognize and destroy certain proteins and cells (the cancerous cells) through phagocytosis (mechanism of destruction through immune system).\nHow to Cope with Breast Cancer\nIt\u2019s important that breast cancer patients get rid of the fear and traumas associated with the diagnosis and actually try to understand the disease. This will help them manage it more effectively:\n- Share your feelings with the near and dear ones.\n- Joining a support group helps get rid of the so called \u201cblues\u201d.\n- Indulge in activities of interest like books, music, movies etc.\n- Eat healthy, think healthy.\n- Take rest.\nTalk to your doctor about changes in symptoms etc. and discuss ways to manage them in the best possible manner.\nAbout the Author: Jessica Palin works as a health writer and blogger for Robertgrantmd, (New York plastic surgery).

{"text":"Playing with Equations to Solve Problems\nDate: 09\/16\/2003 at 10:48:13 From: Mara Subject: To state the geometric property of an equation I need to give the geometric property common to all lines in the family x - ky = 1 I know that the answer is that all lines in this family have an x-intercept at x=1 but I am totally clueless about showing why this is the case. At first I thought that using the double-intercept equation (x\/a) + (y\/b) = 1 would work but I couldn't get it in the correct form. Then I tried to solve for x and y and got x = 1 + ky and y = (-1\/k) + (-x\/k) but now I do not know what to do with this. So I was wondering if you knew how to go about solving this?\nDate: 09\/16\/2003 at 12:28:52 From: Doctor Peterson Subject: Re: To state the geometric property of an equation Hi, Mara. I don't think there is any method you can use to solve this sort of problem without a lot of thinking and testing. Let's see how I personally would approach it (as well as I can construct it, considering that I know the answer already!). Then I'll look at some alternative approaches you might take. We have x - ky = 1 and we want to know what property all these lines have in common. Probably, since this is an open-ended question and I don't expect it to be straightforward, I would start by just \"playing\" with the equation, getting a feel for how it works by trying a few special cases. I might take k = 0, 1, and -1 and graph those three lines, x = 1 x - y = 1 x + y = 1 I would find that they all intersect at (1,0), and my answer would be that all the lines seem to contain that point. (In a sense this is a more purely \"geometric\" property than the x-intercept, since it does not refer to the coordinates.) Then I would want to prove that this is true for ALL k, to make sure I hadn't fooled myself by choosing three cases that happened to intersect. Thinking of this as a point shared by all lines in the family, I would prove it by simply substituting x=1, y=0 in the general equation: x - ky = 1 1 - k*0 = 1 is true for all k so (1,0) is indeed on all the lines, not just the three I tried. Or, I might think of it as a common x-intercept, as you said; then I would do what you suggested and put the equation into two-intercept form x\/a + y\/b = 1 That's easy; all it takes is to interpret -ky as y divided by -1\/k: x\/1 + y\/(-1\/k) = 1 So the x-intercept is 1 for all these lines, and the y-intercept is -1\/k. So my approach is to experiment (the more adult word for \"play\"!) and make a conjecture (the more adult word for \"guess\"), and then prove that conjecture. Now, is there any other way you might approach this? If you were really smart (and I might possibly have done this if I were faced with the equation afresh), you could just see that the equation looks like the two-intercept form, and gone directly to the proof. If you could do that, fine; but you can't depend on such insight! You might instead just go through each form of the equation, starting probably with slope-intercept, and see whether any important feature (such as the slope or y-intercept) is constant. When that failed, it would be hard to move on to the point-slope or two-point form, because you would have to choose the point(s), and there is no obvious basis for that choice. So you would probably next try the two- intercept form (which many studuents never see, so you're lucky). Your approach came close. When you solved for x, you just had to look and see that the x-intercept (the constant in that form) is always 1. But since that form, the slope-x-intercept form, is little-known, it's not surprising that you did not know what to do with it. But I really think that my approach is the most reasonable hope to find the answer quickly.

{"text":"It's hard to understand from our knowledge of Greek, Egyptian, and other early civilizations with written records how such a magnificent site could not have been discovered by the Spanish. Yet until its discovery in the 1911, Machu Picchu, \"the lost city of the Incas,\" remained forgotten for 400 years.\nActually, Machu Picchu was not a city at all. It was probably built by Pachacuti Inca as a royal estate and religious retreat in 1460-70. Its location\u2014on a remote secondary road in nearly impassable terrain high above the Urubamba River canyon cloud forest\u2014almost ensured that it would have no administrative, commercial or military use. Any movement in that direction to or from Cusco and the Sacred valley upriver would have been by other Inca roads, either the high road near Salcantay or by the Lucumayo valley road. Travel was restricted on these roads except by Inca decree.\nAfter Pachacuti Inca's death, Machu Picchu remained the property of his allus, or kinship group, who were responsible for maintenance, administration and continued building. As an extraordinary sacred site (location as well as buildings), it surely was visited by Topa Inca and the last great ruler, Huayna Capac, although each in turn built their own estates and palaces. But few outside the Inca's retainers would have known of its existence.\nThe Inca: \"Information's Gotta Be Restricted\"\nOf course the compound would have required a steady supply of outside goods. Machu Picchu, like most Inca sites was undergoing constant construction and must of had a resident crew of builders as well as attendants, planters, and others. So in order to really understand how Machu Picchu remained a secret, it's necessary to understand how Inca culture constricted travel and information.\nThe Inca were a completely ordered an regimented society. Although great numbers of people were moved around for corporate state projects and resettlement, once at a location, they didn't move. The royal roads were reserved for official travel. The Incas were able to control their remarkable state system through a pyramidal hierarchy with information and direction flowing down through 10 overseers to 100, to 1000 and so on. We know from historical writing and the archaeological record that the Incas did not possess a written language, although, they must have used some symbols and perhaps diagrams. We also know that the Quipu (collection of colored strings and knots) was extensively used for accounting and record keeping. But Quipus need highly trained interpreters to read them, and the Spanish were unable to locate or interrogate even one of these specialists. The Inca also maintained a class or guild of verbal historians. But with the catastrophic collapse of Inca state structure following the arrival of the Spanish, these historians were scattered and forgotten.\nBut Machu Picchu was mostly forgotten even before the Spanish came. Small pox was the conquistadores' advance guard. Huayna Capac and an estimated 50 percent of the population died of small pox sometime around 1527. Inca government suffered, and after a period of turmoil, the empire fell into civil war over Inca secession. Machu Picchu was probably abandoned at this time\u2014both because it was expensive to maintain and with most of the population dead from war or epidemic, it was hard to find the labor to keep it up.\nConquistadores: If It Ain't Gold, We Don't Care\nThe Pizarros arrived in Cusco in 1532. The first wave of Spanish were mostly illiterate, uneducated adventurers who had little interest in anything besides wealth and power. By the time scholars and administrators arrived, knowledge of Machu Picchu had been lost.\nManco Inca staged a country wide rebellion in 1536. After a failed siege of Cusco, Manco, along with remnants of the court, army and followers, abandoned his headquarters at Ollantaytambo. Fleeing back into the remote Vilcabamba beyond Machu Picchu, He burned and destroyed Inca settlements and sites accessible to the Spanish including Llatapata at the start of the trail to Machu Picchu from the Urubamba River.\nBut by that point it hardly mattered. The Machu Picchu trail and the site itself would have been long overgrown and the approach blocked by seasonal landslides that so hinder backcountry travel in Peru.\nBeyond personal observations and many trips to Machu Picchu, I have borrowed heavily from the excellent work of John Hemming, John Rowe and Johan Reinhart.

{"text":"REFORM IN SPANISH EDUCATION: THE INSTITUCION LIBRE DE ENSENANZA\nby Noel M. Valis\nPaper presented to Thomas Woody Society, University of Pennsylvania, January 26, 1977\nThis document examines the development and influence of the Free Institute of Education (Institucion Libre de Ensenanza) and of its founder, Don Francisco Giner de los Rios, in late nineteenth century Spain. Founded in 1876 against a background of repression and reimposition of state-controlled education during the Bourbon Restoration the Institute was a private institution free of Church and State. Its intent was to create an alternative to the higher education system of official Spain, but due to financial problems, it evolved into an institution of primary and secondary education. Subject matter included traditional, State-required subjects, but also anthropology, technology, social sciences, economics, art, drawing, singing, and handwork--all generally neglected in State- and Church-run schools. Most radical were the innovations in art and physical education (stressing free inquiry, observation, and spontaneous criticism in the former, and development of the whole person in the latter) and in the institution of field trips, hiking, and nature observation. The use of textbooks was discouraged as much as possible, and examinations were regarded as producing mostly negative results. Emphasis was placed instead upon the creation of student notebooks that reflected the pupil's judgment and synthesis of materials. Don Francisco borrowed much from the French and English forms of education, and was influenced by Rousseau, Froebel, Pestalozzi, Krause, and Sanz Del Rio, the last of whom provided his ideal of reconciling all human facilities to produce an artistic taste, technical preparedness, spiritual elevation and an austere, moral sense of life. The Institute fell victim to the Civil War of 1936, but proved a pervasive influence in Spanish society to this day. (MB)\nIt has sometimes been said of Spanish philosophy, \"What Spanish philosophy?\" The same reproach might be directed at the non-existence of Spanish education. \"There ain't no such animal,\" some might claim, forgetting for the moment the intellectual freedom and depth of thirteenth-century Toledo under the reign of Alfonso X, the Wise (El Sabio), and the splendor and revival of learning in the sixteenth-century Universities of Salamanca, Alcala and other institutions. What is mostly remembered, however, is the disheartening decline of Spanish education, ushered in by the rigidities, fears and intolerance of the Catholic Counter-Reformation, of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Spain.\nBut this view of education in Spain, of necessity simplified, would not be complete without mention of the establishment and significance of the Instititucion Libre de Ensenanza, in English, the Free Institution\/Institute of Education. In order to understand more clearly the Institute's impact on Spanish society, I will review very quickly some of the historical background to its founding in 1876.\nA broad overview of nineteenth-century Spain reveals to us that the \"lack of civility\" among Spaniards, which reached such extreme proportions during the 1936-30 Civil War, had its roots in the last century. Civil war, frequent military uprisings in the form of \"pronunciamientos,\" and dissension everywhere created an ambience of unease and fragmentation within Spanish society. Historians talk of \"Las dos Espanas,\" the \"two Spains,\" that is, the liberal, progressive side as opposed to the traditional, sometimes reactionary side of the country. It is probably more accurate, however, to talk of the many Spains.\nTo disagree was the Spaniard's right -- no, his duty to himself, to his own proud sense of individuality and dignity. A solution imposed from above, from the State, seemed, in many cases, the only solution when there were problems, and there were many -- economic, political, religious. The problem of Spanish education was only of several, and it too came to be subsumed into the more general and overriding conflict of State versus Individual, of Authority vs. Freedom. Reconciling such absolutes frequently failed; worse still, the distinction between philosophy and ideology, that is, between the search for truth and the molding, frequent distorting of existential reality to one's own conception of it, this distinction would too often become blurred in the disputes and violence of nineteenth-century Spain. Tempers rose, passions were unleashed, ideologies reigned supreme, and somewhere in the shuffle, clarity of vision and truth were lost.\nThis split in Spanish society in part gave birth to the Free Institute of Education. Specifically, we must look to the years 1868 and 1874 to explain how the Institute came into being. The date 1868 conjures up one outstanding event in modern Spanish history: the overthrow of the reigning Bourbon monarch, Isabel II, an action which is termed the Glorious Revolution of 1868. It was a somewhat qualified victory for the liberal cause in Spain since the end result was to bring confusion, instability, bitterness, and finally, in 1874, the reestablishment of another Bourbon king, Isabel's son, Alfonso XII. This period, called the Restoration (Restauracion) in Spain, also reinstated the State-controlled, religiously oriented educational system which the Revolution of 1868 had attempted to change. This move and the specific action which the Minister in charge of education, Manuel de Orovio, brought against the future founder of the Institute, Francisco Giner de los Rios, would be the direct and immediate causes of the Institute's creation.\nSPANISH EDUCATION: OVERVIEW\nBefore going into a more detailed explanation of the origins of the Institute, I think a brief look at the state of Spanish education prior to 1876 would be useful. In my opening statement, I mentioned two high points in the history of Spanish education: the medieval center of learning in Toledo and the sixteenth-century Universities of Salamanca and Alcala de Henares. Both periods were characterized by a high enthusiasm for learning and considerable freedom in which to do it. In Toledo, Jews, Moors and Christians collaborated together in a spirit of respect and tolerance. In the first half of the sixteenth century, students and professors at Salamanca, Alcala and other universities constituted, within an amazing diversity of university modes of existence, an entity independent of the strictures and authority of the State. Yet by the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, learning in Spain seemed to have ceased. For example, at the University of Salamanca, the Chair for Mathematics and Astrology -- the title speaks for itself, I think -- remained vacant for thirtyyears until it was finally filled in 1726.\nWhat happened? In brief: The Counter-Reformation. This is obviously a great simplification of the causes of Spain's decadence in education and elsewhere. But certainly Spain's withdrawal and increasing isolation from the rest of Europe from the middle of the sixteenth century on explains in part the origins of stagnation in her schools and universities. In 1559 Philip II forbade study in foreign universities; shortly before that, he banned the importing of books from abroad. The additional power of the Inquisition to safeguard orthodoxy among Spaniards and weed out the impure and heretical elements must also be taken into account. And finally, as the historian Americo Castro has pointed out, Spaniards became reluctant to demonstrate intellectual powers and curiosity for fear of being taken for a Jew. Spanish Jews were known for their interest in intellectual matters. And nobody wanted to deal with the Inquisition.\nTo control the inner life and content of the universities and other schools the government stepped in so that by the nineteenth century Spanish schools, particularly the Universities, to quote Salvador Madariaga, \"were more Government establishments for the granting of official diplomas\" (p. 75, Spain, N.Y., 1943). He goes on to say that \"in a sense all universities tend fatally to become degree factories. But in Spain ... they were nothing else.\"\nSchooling on all levels were plagued by unimaginative, and stiff, unbending teaching, bad textbooks, long hours of routine and frequent utter boredom, and sometimes even brutalization. Memorization and recitation were the chief pedagogic tools. The first third of the last century also brought in more imitation of French manners and customs, certainly not the first instance of French influence on Spanish education. Eighteenth-century Spain had already adopted Gallic centralization of schooling. The critic Mariano Jose de Larra describes the mania of copying, badly, I might add, French mores among the Spanish middle classes and well-to-do. The narrator of \"El casarse pronto y mal\" writes that his sister became enamored of French customs and from then on, \"bread was no longer bread (pan), nor wine, wine (vino).\" \"Suffice it to say,\" continues Larra in this ironic vein,\nthat my sister adopted the ideas of the period; but as this second education was as shallow and superficial as the first (her Spanish upbringing), and as that weak segment of humanity never knows how not to go to extremes, she suddenly jumped from the Christian Year of Our Lord 18__ to the era of Pigault Lebrun (a frivolous, sometimes scandalous French novelist) and left off going to Mass and devotions, without knowing in the least why she did so, why she used to go in the first place. She said that her son could be educated in whatever manner it suited him; that he could read without order or method whatever books fell into his hands; and God knows what other things she said about ignorance and fanaticism, reason and enlightenment, adding that religion was a social contract into which only idiots entered in good faith and that the boy didn't need religion to be good; that the terms, father and mother (padre y madre) were lower-class, and that one should treat one's papa and mama familiarly with the tu form of address because there is no friendship like that which unites parents to their children. (Articulos de Costumbres, Madrid,  1965).\nA writer of a later period, Jose Maria de Pereda retains this image of his school days in the 1840's:\nThe chill of death, the obscurity of a dungeon, the stench of grottoes, the unhappiness, affliction and pain of torture permeated the classroom ... Virgil and Dante, so clever in depicting hell and torment, would have been at wit's end to describe those images of school which are engraved in my memory for the rest of my life ... I believed myself cut off from the refuge of my family and the protection of the State; I heard the swish of the cane and the complaints of the victims, and the lessons were very long, and there were no excuses for not knowing them; and not knowing them meant caning and mockery, which also hurt; and confinement, fisticuffs, whipping, and the ignominy of all these things. Who is the brave soul who could truly paint such scenes if the worst of it was what the spirit felt and not what the eyes saw or the flesh suffered? (Esbozos y rasgunos, \"Mas reminiscencias,\" Obras completas, v. 1, Madrid,  1959, p. 1226).\nHe then goes on to say that \"one had to know the lesson literally (al pie de la letra\"), word for word. One misplaced word, one substitute, was enough to merit punishment.\" (p. 1226). Why, one asks, was this so? Pereda explains that the professor \"taught the way he had been taught: by blows. Little by little the habit became part of his nature. The want of intellect, the extreme devotion to the profession, the traditions of the classroom and the educational system did the rest.\" (p. 1232).\nAnd finally, here is the testimony of yet another writer, the novelist Benito Perez Galdos, who describes Spanish education in the 1860's:\nThe class lasted hours and hours ... Never was there a more repugnant nightmare, fashioned out of horrible aberrations which were called Arithmetic, Grammar or Ecclesiastical History ... Around the axis of boredom revolved such grave problems as syntax, the rule of three, the sons of Jacob, all confounded in the common hue of pain, all tinted with loathing ... (El Doctor Centeno, Obras completas, v. 4, Madrid, p. 1319).\nPereda was a conservative, Galdos a liberal -- yet both concur that the Spanish educational system was wretched. Thus, when liberals and progressives took control in 1868, one of their first priorities was educational reform. They declared, first of all, the principle of freedom of education and teaching. The instability and factionalism of the liberal regime, however, precluded any lasting reforms in education. The conservative return to power in 1874 reestablished the right of the State to dictate to schools the textbooks to be used and the curriculum to be followed. In addition, Orovio, the Minister in charge of education, sent out to the Directors (or Rectores) of the Universities a circular in which he recommended that no religious doctrines inimical to those held by the State be taught and that no political ideas be expressed to the detriment of the king's person or the constitutional monarchy then in power. The circular also stated that action would be taken against any professor who so indulges in such political or religious meditations -- i.e., expulsion from the University. The Minister's recommendations were no mere recommendations.\nThe result of all this was the removal of several professors from their faculty chairs. Among them was the future founder of the Institute, Francisco Giner de los Rios. For not adhering to the State's demands, he was arrested in March 1875, at 4:00 in the morning, and spent four months confinement until he was finally expelled from the University.\nThe principle in question was clearly one of academic freedom. The State, however, saw the \"university question\" (\"cuestion universitaria\") from another angle: that is, the University and its Faculties were no more than instruments of the government's policies and, therefore, were obligated to conform to the State's instructions and directives. The professors were, in effect, civil servants (and still are today).\nThis, then, is the historical and educational background to the founding of the Institucion Libre de Ensenanza, the Institute, in 1876.\nTHE INSTITUCION LIBRE DE ENSENANZA\nPerhaps the most significant point to be made about the Institute's existence is the profound and far-reaching, if diffuse, influence of its founder, Francisco Giner de los Rios, a professor of philosophy of law at the University of Madrid. It was largely Don Francisco's attractive and vibrant personality which held the Institute together and proved to be the Prime Mover of the school. All the accounts of Don Francisco by friends, former students, disciplines, and fellow professors stress the very personal and individual effect of the man. This is not to deny the cogency of his ideas and methods of teaching but simply to make clear that, with Don Francisco, abstractions were made concrete in his very person; that is, through him and his relations with men and women, he incarnated his own beliefs. One friend had this to say about him as a teacher at the time of his death in 1915:\nWhat was the secret of his teaching? Did he reveal anything new? Or was it that everything was transformed at the touch of his powerful creative imagination?\nThe secret lay as much in the form as in the substance.\nAs a teacher, he brought us something that was the complete opposite of the old methods; and he discouraged the craze for oratory which has been so damaging to education in Spain. In his lectures at the University or at the Institution, he only aimed at one thing: to shake the pupil out of his torpor, stir him up to independent investigation, to working the thing out by himself; and above all he recommended games, art, the country.\nAs an educationist he created a complete system of social education, which had for its axis the child, the citizen, the man as he would like to see him, healthy in mind and body, and working for a Spain that was strong and dignified and which must one day rise again. (J.B. Trend, Origins of Modern Spain, N.Y. 1934, p. 99).\nOr as another writer put it: \"He gave us our conception of the universe and of the way to peel an orange.\" (p. 103).\nWhat was Don Francisco's creation, the Institute, like and what were its educational and philosophical origins? How did Don Francisco and his disciples \"make men,\" \"hacer hombres,\" the overriding goal of the Institute? As J.B. Trend, Rafael Altamira, and others have noted, Don Francisco Giner believed that the most pressing problem of Spain was the problem of education. He, like the literary Generation of 1898, was obsessed -- and rightly so -- with the question of Spain's decadence, and the vital necessity for her regeneration. And he took the now classic position of the nineteenth-century liberal that through education lay the country's revitalization. It must be clearly understood that Don Francisco's efforts were those of a minority and directed toward a minority. It was not mass education, although the effects of the Institute certainly were to reach public education throughout Spain in the twentieth century.\nFirst and most important, the Institute was created as a private institution, independent of both Church and State. I don't think it is necessary to do more than mention here the historic interdependence of Church and State in Spain. The credo of the Institute, which appeared regularly on the masthead of its publication, the Bulletin of the Free Institute of Education (El Boletin de la Institucion Libre de Ensenanza) was as follows:\nThe Free Institute of Education is completely opposed to religious, philosophical and political sectarianism, proclaiming only the principle of liberty and the inviolability of science and the concomitant independence of scientific research and explanation, with regard to any other authority than that of the conscience itself of the Professor, who is alone responsible for his ideas. (cited by A. Jimenez-Landi, \"Don Francisco Giner de los Rios y la Institucion Libre de Ensenanza,\" Revista Hispanica Moderna, v. 25, nos. 1, 2, 1959, p. 16).\nBecause Spain's educational history had been one of bickering and divisiveness between the demands of the State and the private sector, and conflict between the precepts of the Church and needs of Science, with Religion usually dominating over Science, Don Francisco abhorred dogmatic, closed positions. He fervently believed in tolerance. It was not, however, mere intellectual benevolence which motivated Don Francisco. Rather, it was an ethical, moral stance, a way of life, which he wanted to instill in his pupils, the \"Institutionists.\"\nA follower of Giner de los Rios, Jose Castillejo, has written that, for Don Francisco, \"the two greatest forces in education are: the personality of the teacher and the social atmosphere and surroundings of the school\" (Wars of Ideas in Spain, London, 1937, p. 97). We have already seen in the magnetic power of Don Francisco's teaching itself the importance of the teacher's personality. What about the ambience of the school?\nHere, one sees right away to what extent Don Francisco and his disciples felt compelled to move away from the current, i.e., antiquated and rigid teaching methods and atmosphere of both public and private schools in Spain. First, the classroom should be informal, akin to familial surroundings. The teacher should not merely dictate or lecture, but rather converse, using whatever approach or combination of approaches worked best, starting with the Socratic dialogue. No one method was to be used, to the exclusion of all others. The teacher was a guide, the pupils a family. A small family. Classes were to be kept small. And coeducational (Primary and secondary education in Spain today is not coeducational.) Cordiality and the spirit of discovery were the key words at the Institute. Don Francisco aimed at dispelling not only the fear and horror of school, such as we have seen in Pereda's reminiscences, but the passivity with which most students received their education.\nThe original intent of the Institute was to create an alternative to the higher education of official Spain, but the desire was not to be met. It was quickly found to be beyond the resources of the Institute which suffered from chronic insufficiency of funds from its inception. Instead, the school evolved into an institution of primary and secondary education. Since most students entering a Spanish university were ill-prepared to meet its demands, the \"Institutionists\" felt that a solid intellectual, moral, physical and spiritual background given in the primary and secondary levels of education was an a priori necessity.\nWhat was taught at the Institute besides the traditional subjects required by the State ___ curriculum included Anthropology, Technology, Social Sciences, Economics, Art, Drawing, Singing, and Handwork. Most of these subjects were generally neglected in State and Church-run schools of the period.\nMost remembered and most significant are the innovations carried out in the arts and in physical education, and the frequent excursions. First, art. \"Institutionists,\" for the most part, tried to avoid systematic and highly structured courses in art and art history. Instead, they emphasized such activities as excursions to historical monuments and places and visits to museums. Such an unorthodox procedure was unheard-of in nineteenth-century Spain. Rather than mere lessons, the Institute stressed the actual, vivid experiencing of art as much as possible. Like the literary generation of 1898, they also, in a sense, rediscovered Spain's cultural heritage, by extolling the value of Spanish folklore, architecture and painting. It was, for example, a disciple of Don Francisco, Manuel de Cossio, who rediscovered the forgotten and neglected El Greco for Spaniards and the rest of the world.\nOne of the most delightful illustrations of the Institute's approach to art is to be found in Don Francisco's essay on \"Spontaneous Criticism by Children of the Fine Arts.\" In it he describes how a group of children of twelve and fourteen years of age, conducted by him one day to a museum, learned to form their own artistic sensibilities and judgments by comparing two pieces of sculpture, one by Donatello and the other by Lucas de la Robbia. On this occasion, Don Francisco did not even attempt to point out the obvious differences in style, expression and composition in the two sculptures. He simply let the children use their own powers of observation, uninfluenced by any previous explanations or prejudices. Thus, through observation, they were able to define the work.\nThe second and more difficult problem, says Don Francisco, was one of judgment. Which was the better sculpture? \"I discovered,\" he writes, \"a very curious phenomenon: there was a unanimous explosion in favor of Lucas de la Robbia. They stumbled over their words in their rush to tell me that from the very first de la Robbia had seemed to them so superior that they could scarcely understand why there should be any doubt; that sweetness, that mystical expression, that softness, that elegance, that repose. How could anyone compare this divine object with the coarse rawness and the hard, unbecoming and massive forms of Donatello? Why, it was almost a caricature of a sculpture! 'And Donatello is a sculptor with a great reputation!' they told me, almost aggressively. You can imagine how I resisted giving them the least sign of disagreement with this vehemently-held point of view, nor did I even invite them to study more carefully both works before pronouncing an opinion. Showing nothing but the most rigorous neutrality and even indifference, I began to look around rather distractedly, now at one piece, now at another. They did the same. After a little while, and spontaneously, there occurred a certain attenuation in the crudeness of their first judgment: 'No, I wouldn't say that it was exactly grotesque (in Spanish, 'un mamarracho').' 'There's a certain strength; the composition has a certain vigor.' 'If you put the piece in the right place, it wouldn't seem so bulky, so massive ...' And then: 'You know, if you really look hard at these things of Donatello, they're very manly; de la Robbia seems a little effeminate,' etc., etc. Finally, why prolong it? The gradual reversal of opinion in favor of Donatello reached the point of one child saying: 'There must be other works of Lucas de la Robbia which deserve his fame.' And it was precisely the very boy who had first placed in doubt the merits of Donatello's own reputation.\" (\"Antologia,\" Revista Hispanica Moderna, v. 25, nos, 1, 2, 1959, pp. 132-133).\nA second innovation which I mentioned before was the approach to physical education. Rather than the routine and boredom of calisthenics, directed toward a military goal of physical competence, the Institute stressed games, games which were to form character. The use of games as an ethical force is, of course, an educational practice borrowed from the public schools of England. Anyone who has read Kipling's Stalky and Company or the early school novels of P. G. Wodehouse will have a good idea of what I am referring to.\nBut, for Don Francisco, playing cricket and football also signified that the whole person was being educated. Intellectual formation alone was lopsided. To provide an integral education required an awareness and use of one's own body. Mere discreet walks, in carefully monitored lines, which was the usual practice and extent of physical exercise in other schools, were simply inadequate.\nThe third point of the Institute's educational program were the excursions out to the countryside. This also was unheard-of in the last century of Spain. Long walks and mountain climbing simply were not done. In Don Francisco's time, people shut all their windows tight, never letting in fresh air; they frequented taverns and cafes, and sometimes strolled casually at night for a short walk along a busy thoroughfare, but almost never thought exploring the countryside an exhilarating occupation. Again, like the Generation of 1898, Don Francisco and his Institute discovered the Spanish countryside. Before that, almost no one seems to have appreciated it. Realist novelists, for example, rarely describe Nature; even the Spanish Romanticists evidence little sensitivity toward Nature.\nThe idea, which was brought back from Paris in 1878 by one of the Institute's professors, was, like the introduction of games, imported from abroad and adapted to Spanish circumstances. Excursions developed the intellectual and physical capabilities of the pupil; more important, for Don Francisco, they allowed one to enter into communion with Nature, to feel oneself as part of a Whole.\nI would like to touch briefly on two other aspects of the Institute's educational program; the use of textbooks and examinations. Don Francisco discouraged the use of textbooks; to a great extent, he did so as a reaction to the wretched official textbooks forced on students at State-and Church-run schools. Instead, he preferred the creation of student notebooks which reflected the child's own judgments and synthesis of the material, and which were carefully checked and read by the teachers. Likewise, Don Francisco felt that examinations brought mostly negative results. Examinations in other schools were simply the means to acquire a degree; and stressed only the student's ability to memorize and to repeat exactly what the Professor dictated in class.\nRespect for the freedom of the child is at the heart of the Institute's teaching. The intuitive method in education, which goes back to Jacques Rousseau, by way of Froebel and Pestalozzi, was practiced by the Institute. This meant the substitution of restraint, obligation, and mechanical behavior by personal effort, spontaneity, and school work which had become ___ and attractive.\nThese then, were the main points of the Institute's program. It should be noted that the educational reform undertaken by the Institute was not the first instance of attempts to improve education in Spain; and that the Institute's pedagogy depended, to a large extent, on influences from abroad which were modified to suit the Spanish temperament. The pedagogical efforts of [Gaspar Melchor de] Jovellanos in the eighteenth century and the short-lived Pestalozzian schools of the early nineteenth are but two examples of such attempts at educational improvement in Spain. With regard to the Institute's educational philosophy, we have already seen that the \"Institutionists\" borrowed from both England and France. And a survey of the Institute's publications reveals that Don Francisco and his colleagues were quite aware of the pedagogical approaches of Pestalozzi and Froebel.\nBut perhaps the most significant, if somewhat vague, influence on the Institute is derived from the importation of the ideas of an obscure, second-rate German philosopher by name of Christian Friedrich Krause by a then equally obscure Spanish professor, Julian Sanz del Rio. This is not the place to examine the abstruse metaphysics of Krause or of Sanz del Reio's adaptation of it, but simply to state that Sanz del Rio's profoundly ethical work, Humanity's Ideal for Life strongly influenced Francisco Giner de los Rios and many other Spanish intellectuals who, during the 1860's and 70's, called themselves Krausistas. The Krausist tendency and ideal to create a world increasingly more unified, harmonious and complete is translated in pedagogical terms into the attempt to reconcile all the faculties of the human being, to develop the whole personality of the individual so that he or she might cultivate not only an artistic taste and sensibility, but a technical preparation, spiritual elevation, and an austere, moral sense of life.\nDespite the criticisms leveled against Don Francisco and his Institute of being anti-religious, the Institute did inculcate a spiritual leaning in its students without favoring any particular orthodox religious belief. Don Francisco himself was a boliovor. Jose Castillejo writes that \"Ginor ... following Sanz del Rio, believed that schools need a religious spirit, to lift up the minds of children towards a universal order of the world, a supreme ideal of life and a harmony among men and between humanity and Nature. Without that spirit education is dead and dry\" (Wars of Ideas in Spain, p. 100). One could say, in brief, that the whole of the Institute's education, the entire atmosphere of the Institute, was permeated with this spiritualization of man and the universe.\nIt does not take too much imagination to see that the Institute would not be without enemies. The ideological dichotomy between left and right, progressive and traditionalist, in Spain immediately polarized the significance of the Institute. It was the product of the Devil for some; the only hope and salvation in Spain for others. The Institute itself fell, one more victim, to the ravages of Spain's Civil War in 1936. Yet, looked at dispassionately, the Institute's openness to ideas and influences from the rest of Europe, its undogmatic approach to education and to life itself, could not help but bring a breath of fresh air to the closed and narrow society of nineteenth-century Spain. If it perhaps erred too much in the direction of intellectual anarchy and placed too much confidence in the innate goodness of man, the Institute's efforts at raising the moral and intellectual level of Spaniards became an all-pervasive influence in many institutions, both public and private, in government circles, in business. The Institute was \"much more than a school.\" It was an atmosphere of intellectual and moral enlightenment; and a belief in the regeneration of Spain.","id":"<urn:uuid:df3439e0-db77-4b79-9f38-5a9f9dd9fe4b>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.naderlibrary.com\/lit.reformspaneducvalis.toc.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9695907831,"token_count":6658,"score":3.0625,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Fewer rare sea turtles will die on the swordfish industry's longlines in Hawaii under an agreement between environmental groups and the government. The agreement settles a lawsuit challenging the federal government's plans that would have dramatically increase the number of turtles that could be killed. The Turtle Island Restoration Network, Center for Biological Diversity and KAHEA sued the National Marine Fisheries Service for allowing 46 imperiled Pacific loggerhead turtles to be hooked last year. The new court-ordered settlement caps the number at 17 per year. Meanwhile the National Marine Fisheries Service is weighing whether loggerheads need more protection under the Endangered Species Act.\n\"It made absolutely no sense to have one arm of the National Marine Fisheries Service increasing the lethal capture of loggerheads, while the other arm is in the process of determining whether loggerheads should be uplisted from threatened to endangered,\" said Todd Steiner, biologist and executive director of Turtle Island Restoration Network. \"With extinction looming, these animals need more protection, not less.\"\n\"With this decision, Hawaii's public-trust ocean resources can be better managed for our collective best interest, and not just the interests of this commercial fishery,\" said KAHEA program director Marti Townsend. \"This is a victory not just for the turtles, but for Hawaii's people who rely on a healthy, functioning ocean ecosystem.\"\nConservation groups represented by Earthjustice filed a federal lawsuit challenging a 2009 rule allowing the swordfish fleet to catch nearly three times as many loggerhead sea turtles as previously permitted. This settlement freezes the number at the previous cap of 17 while the government conducts additional environmental studies and decides whether or not to classify the loggerhead as endangered, rather than its current, less-protective status of threatened. For leatherback turtles, the bycatch limit remains at 16 per year. In 2010, eight Pacific leatherbacks and seven loggerheads were caught in the longline fishery, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service. There have already been 4 loggerheads captured in 2011, which has sea turtle conservationists concerned.\n\"Sea turtles have been swimming the oceans since the time of dinosaurs. But without a change in management, they won't survive our voracious quest for swordfish and tuna,\" said Miyoko Sakashita, oceans director at the Center for Biological Diversity. \"If loggerheads are going to survive in the North Pacific, we need to stop killing them in our fisheries.\"\n\"Pacific loggerhead sea turtles are nearly extinct, so this bycatch rollback helps right a serious wrong,\" said Teri Shore, program director at Turtle Island Restoration Network. \"We can't allow these rare sea turtles to disappear for a plate of swordfish. It's tragic that it took a lawsuit to correct this fishery problem.\"\nSwordfish longline vessels trail up to 60 miles of fishing line suspended in the water with floats, with as many as 1,000 baited hooks deployed at regular intervals. Sea turtles become hooked while trying to take bait or become entangled while swimming through the nearly invisible lines. These encounters can drown the turtles or leave them with serious injuries. Sea birds such as albatross dive for the bait and become hooked; marine mammals, including endangered humpback whales and false killer whales, also sometimes become hooked when they swim through the floating lines.","id":"<urn:uuid:e36683d3-ded6-4e38-af4d-7bc73d1ec7e3>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/earthjustice.org\/news\/press\/2011\/endangered-sea-turtles-saved-from-capture-in-hawaii-swordfish-fishery","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9501281381,"token_count":666,"score":3.125,"int_score":3}

The summary of the lecture is republished here with the author\u2019s consent.\nTHE ABUSE OF HOLOCAUST MEMORY 2011-2012\nSummary of Lecture in Helsinki 8 November 2012\nBy Manfred Gerstenfeld\nThe Holocaust has become a symbol of absolute evil in Western society. This happened gradually over the past decades. It was not the case in say, 1960. Yet one might have expected that with the Second World War more than 65 years behind us, the mention and memory of it would fade away. Indeed, there is in many circles what is termed \u201cHolocaust fatigue.\u201d These people do not want to hear anything anymore about the Holocaust.\nAt the same time, many others increasingly mention and discuss the Holocaust. It took 60 years until in 2005 the United Nations General Assembly named 27 January as International Holocaust Remembrance Day. On this day, every member state of the UN has an official obligation to honor the victims of the Nazi era and develop educational material about the Holocaust. This year the remembrance of the Holocaust is devoted to children.1\nWhy this Interest in the Holocaust?\nWhat are the main reasons for this increasing interest in the Holocaust? We can identify some but do not know their relative weight. Memorial celebrations take place every year in many places. There are also new monuments still going up and new memorial centers are being inaugurated. One was at Drancy the major transit camp in France. There 63,000 of the 76,000 deported Jews transited before almost all of them were sent to their deaths. Yet both memorial days pass and monuments disappear from the public eye most of the time.\nNew historical research is being published about the Holocaust. Additional documents are also discovered. One example among many was that in October 2012, pictures taken by Hitler\u2019s personal photographer Hugo Jaeger, of Polish Jews in the ghetto of Kutno between 1939 and 1940 were released. This was done to mark the official establishment of the Warsaw Ghetto in October 1940.2 Such research and discoveries are mentioned in the media. Thus they also play a role in the increased interest.\nThe increasing central place of the Holocaust in European societies is also due to a number of other important developments. One is that European societies have become increasingly secular, which means that their common norms and values have to a large extent broken down. In such an ideological and moral vacuum, one seeks out standards many people more or less agree upon. The Holocaust partly fills that function. It plays a role as a defining moment in European history.\nThe Holocaust touches upon very basic questions which many Europeans do not like to ask themselves explicitly. What was it in European culture and in European societies that made the Holocaust possible? This leads to a taboo question. Have the elements which made the Holocaust possible disappeared, or are they to some extent still with us?\nThe first nations which should ask these questions are Germany and Austria. Yet at present they do not seem inclined to do so. The present generation is not responsible for what their ancestors did. However, the Holocaust and Nazism can not be eliminated from German history. I would like to phrase the question somewhat differently. Many of the ancestors of contemporary Germans and Austrians were Nazi enthusiasts. Many other Germans and Austrians went along with the Nazis without hesitation. Is it at all imaginable that nothing of these attitudes has remained in these countries today?\nAnother element of importance for the increasing interest in the Holocaust is the growing uncertainty in the world. That requires more and more points of reference for events which take place almost daily. One example which has to be analyzed is the emergence of parties in European countries with many neo-fascist and neo-Nazi characteristics. This becomes problematic in particular if these parties enter Parliament.\nWhile the interest in the Holocaust is growing there is simultaneously also a massive increase in the distortion of the history and the memory of the Holocaust. To understand the abuse of the Holocaust in our days, we have to start looking at it by category. In my book, \u201cThe Abuse of Holocaust Memory, Distortions and Responses\u201d I have developed eight categories of distortion. These are: Holocaust Justification and Promotion, Holocaust Denial, Holocaust Deflection and Whitewashing, De-Judaization, Holocaust Equivalence,Holocaust Inversion, i.e the Portraying of Israel and Jews as Nazis, Holocaust Trivialization and Obliterating Holocaust Memory\nThe massive ongoing abuse of the Holocaust brings us to the question, what can be done about it? There is no single way to fight against the abuse of the Holocaust. Education is very important. So are memorials, monuments etc. The crucial point however remains not to let abuse of the Holocaust enter further in the public debate.\nIt is a task for everybody to react when Israel is called a Nazi state and to call on governments to bring the Iranian leaders Grand Ayatollah Khamenei and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad before an international court because of their Holocaust promotion and to do the same with Hamas. This could be the beginning of a much wider struggle against Holocaust distortion.","id":"<urn:uuid:7c271c94-3cbe-4735-a314-de7c0d7ccbdb>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/tundratabloids.com\/2012\/11\/dr-manfred-gerstenfeld-lecture-in-helsinki-on-abuse-of-the-holocaust-memory.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9642561078,"token_count":1051,"score":3.140625,"int_score":3}

Research careers that you are interested in and that would utilize your strengths. What type of education is required to get into the field? Do you need a graduate degree? Will you need to pursue a long internship or residency program? Are you willing to spend the time it takes to fulfill these requirements?\nRemember, you don't have to have all the answers, but if you have an idea in mind, it can only help you. With possible careers in mind, you can research the college majors that are relevant. You can determine what colleges offer strong programs in your chosen majors, or if a career college would be a good option.","id":"<urn:uuid:e2ad8169-48d0-448e-ad21-efc500136d25>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.petersons.com\/~\/~\/~\/link.aspx?_id=D96F50E5B7054A2DBB0ACA230416B169&_z=z","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9768317938,"token_count":338,"score":2.65625,"int_score":3}

{"text":"The well-being of people all over the world depends on the various goods and services provided by ecosystems, including food, fuel, construction materials, clean water and air, and protection from natural hazards. Ecosystems, however, are under increasing pressure from unsustainable use and other threats including outright conversion. To address this concern, IUCN promotes the sound management of ecosystems through the wider application of the Ecosystem Approach \u2013 a strategy for the integrated management of land, water and living resources that places human needs at its centre, through the Ecosystem Management Programme.\nThe Ecosystem Management Programme works on four key programmatic areas for IUCN:\n- Drylands, where the programme aims to demonstrate the importance of dryland ecosystem services for livelihood improvement and for adapting to climate change.\n- Climate Change, where the Climate Change Initiative aims to include biodiversity concerns in adaptation and mitigation polices and practice, as well as furthering natural resource management strategies that help biodiversity and people to adapt to the impacts of climate change. The Initiative coordinates Climate Change work across IUCN's programmes, regions, Commissions and member organizations.\n- Islands, where the Islands Initiative focuses on addressing integrated management challenges for marine, coastal and terrestrial ecosystems, for the conservation of island biodiversity and the sustainable development of island communities, and facilitates IUCN\u2019s work on islands across the Union.\n- Disaster Risk Reduction, where the programme aims to promote integration of ecosystem management, livelihoods, community vulnerability and climate change adaptation to disaster management.\nIn addition, the Programme provides technical input on integrating wider ecosystem-scale biodiversity issues into IUCN\u2019s programmes globally, regionally and nationally.\nThe Programme also serves as a focal point in the Secretariat for IUCN\u2019s Commission on Ecosystem Management (CEM), a network of more than 800 volunteer ecosystem management experts from around the world. The Ecosystem Management Programme works in close collaboration with CEM to realize the Commission\u2019s objectives in enhancing the implementation of the Ecosystem Approach. CEM members also contribute technical information to the Ecosystem Management Series: a compilation of best practices and lessons learnt in implementing the Ecosystem Approach.","id":"<urn:uuid:1f6b9831-1ffd-4a9a-96e8-9d9b2d8b2c4b>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/iucn.org\/about\/work\/programmes\/ecosystem_management\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.8820336461,"token_count":442,"score":3.109375,"int_score":3}
