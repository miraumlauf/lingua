{"text":"The scientific world is abuzz with news of the ratification of the existence of the subatomic particle called the Higgs boson - or more colloquially, the 'God particle.' This subatomic particle's existence - which was verified recently (with virtually near certainty) by experiments at the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland - lends credence to several long-standing physical theories such as the so-called Standard Model and the Big Bang Theory.\nThe nickname God particle is ironic for two reasons. First, generally, the nuclear physicists who deal with these matters - postulating the fundamental physical laws of the universe and then setting about to either verify or refute them - tend not to be regular church-goers. While there are some highly prominent scientists who balance personal, religious beliefs with professional, scientific quests, most probably go along with the thoughts of the world-famous physicist, Stephen Hawking:\nI regard the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail. There is no heaven or afterlife for broken down computers; that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark. [Interview in The Guardian, 7\/9\/12]\nSpontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist. It is not necessary to invoke God... [from his book; The Grand Design, 2010]\nSo it is a bit ironic that physics' most famous quest has resulted in the discovery of the 'God particle.' Most physicists are quite comfortable having their names associated with famous - even if dead - humans like Newton, Einstein or the afore-mentioned Hawking. One will find few, if any, attributions to deities in the objects that physicists discover and name or the theories they propose.\nSecond, and more importantly, the discovery that the God particle really exists does not - as the name suggests - imply that God played some role in the creation of the universe. In fact, quite the opposite. The matter is discussed at some length in the July 9 Daily Beast by Lawrence Kraus, a well-known physicist\/cosmologist from Arizona State University:\nThis term [God particle] appeared first in the unfortunate title of a book written by physicist Leon Lederman two decades ago, and while to my knowledge it was never used by any scientist (including Lederman) before or since, it has captured the media's imagination.\nWhat makes this term particularly unfortunate is that nothing could be further from the truth. Assuming the particle in question is indeed the Higgs, it validates an unprecedented revolution in our understanding of fundamental physics and brings science closer to dispensing with the need for any supernatural shenanigans all the way back to the beginning of the universe...If these bold, some would say arrogant, notions derive support from the remarkable results at the Large Hadron Collider, they may reinforce two potentially uncomfortable possibilities: first, that many features of our universe, including our existence, may be accidental consequences of conditions associated with the universe's birth; and second, that creating \"stuff\" from \"no stuff\" seems to be no problem at all-everything we see could have emerged as a purposeless quantum burp in space or perhaps a quantum burp of space itself. Humans, with their remarkable tools and their remarkable brains, may have just taken a giant step toward replacing metaphysical speculation with empirically verifiable knowledge. The Higgs particle is now arguably more relevant than God.\nSo the term God particle was first used by a scientist, but was picked up and popularized by the media. It's catchy and enhances interest in the subject among the public. But like so much else that the media promotes, it is misleading and inappropriate.","id":"<urn:uuid:ed184b23-5659-4b91-97c0-fd818297d417>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.americanthinker.com\/blog\/2012\/07\/does_the_god_particle_prove_that_god_does_or_does_not_exist.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9590326548,"token_count":743,"score":2.546875,"int_score":3}

No. 07\/416,211 by S. Marshall, entitled \"Rapid Halfbitting Stepper\", and assigned to the same assignee as the present invention.\nU.S. Pat. No. 4,675,830 to Hawkins is incorporated herein by reference for the purposes of background information on contour fonts. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07\/416,211 by S. Marshall, entitled \"Rapid Halfbitting Stepper\", and assigned to the same assignee as the present invention, is incorporated by reference herein for the purposes of teaching rasterization.\n\"Contour fonts\" is a term that refers to the use of outlines or contours to describe the shapes of characters used in electronic printing. In a contour font, each character shape is represented by one or more closed curves or paths that traces the boundary of the character. The contour is specified by a series of mathematical equations, which may be in any of several forms, the most common being circular arcs, straight lines, and polynomial expressions. The shape of the contour font is that of the ideal design of the character and, generally, does not depend on parameters associated with any printer. Contour fonts are ideal for use as master representations of typefaces.\nBitmap fonts or raster fonts are composed of the actual characters images that will be printed on a page, and are made by scaling contours to the appropriate size, quantizing or sampling them at the resolution of the printer, and filling the interiors of the characters with black bits or pixels. Achieving high quality in this process is difficult, except at very high resolutions, and requires knowledge of both the marking technology and typographic design considerations. Often, a bitmap font is delivered to a printer. There is a separate bitmap font for each size of a font, and sometimes separate fonts for landscape and portrait orientations.\nThe advantage of a contour font is that it can be scaled to any size and rotated to any angle by simple mathematics. Therefore, a single font suffices to represent all possible printing sizes and orientation, reducing font storage requirements, reducing the cost of font handling.\nThe difficulty in this approach is in achieving high quality character images during the sampling process which generates the raster characters from the contour masters. If the contour character is simply sampled, there will be random .+-.1 pixel variations in stroke thickness. If the printing process tends to erode black areas (common in write-white laser xerography) characters will be consistently too thin. If the printing process tends to fatten black areas (common in write black laser xerography), characters will be too thick.\nAt the high resolution employed in phototypesetters, usually greater than 1,000 spi, no special techniques are required for scaling and sampling the contour font to generate a raster font of any size. This is because although simple sampling necessarily has random one-bit errors, such errors are small compared to the size of the character, making errors insignificant. At 300, 400, and 600 spi though, character strokes are only three or four bits thick and each bit is important. The simplistic methods used by typesetter manufacturers are not sufficient.\nU.S. Pat. No. 4,675,830 to Hawkins, uses defined points in a contour font that must be grid aligned to pixel positions, but the stem widths or edges are not aligned.\nOf particular importance in generating fonts of optimal appearance are maintenance of uniform and correct stroke thickness among characters of a font and on different printing engines, uniform alignment of characters on a baseline, and uniform spacing of characters.\nIn accordance with the invention, there is provided a method for conversion of contour fonts to bitmap fonts with automatic thickening and thinning of strokes, and snapping of character edges to pixel or half pixel boundaries.\nIn accordance with the invention, there is provided a method of producing a raster font from a contour font entailing the steps of: first, deriving font metrics and character metrics of font characters in terms of arbitrary font units; scaling the font characters to a selected size and output resolution (pixels per unit length); altering the thickness of vertical and horizontal strokes of each character to a desired thickness, from the measured font metrics and character metrics, and including a difference applied to the thickness of the strokes by the printer process, to cause the strokes to be close to an integer number of pixels and thickness and to compensate for thing and thickening which the printing engine might produce; bringing the leading and trailing edges of the characters to integer pixel locations, where such locations are based on and scaling the character between the leading and trailing edges proportionally therebetween, and producing a rasterized font from the altered contour font character.\nThese and other aspects of the invention will become apparent from the following description used to illustrate a preferred embodiment of the invention in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which:\nFIG. 1 shows a block diagram of the inventive optimized scaler rasterizer system.\nFIGS. 2A-2E illustrate the development of a raster font from a contour font, using the system described in FIG. 1.\nWith reference to the drawing, where the showing is for the purpose of illustrating an embodiment of the invention and not for the purpose of limiting same, the Figure shows a block diagram of the present invention which will be referred to and described hereinafter.\nFIG. 1 shows a block diagram of the contour rasterization process of the present invention. Beginning with a contour font 10, and with a character \"H\" shown in contour for illustration purposes at FIG. 2A the contour font is analyzed initially at hint generation step 20. At the hint generation, the parameters defining the font are determined, including measurement of the following metrics and character hints:\nTABLE 1______________________________________Font Metric Comments______________________________________Cap-height Height of the H, I or similar letterX-Height Height of the lower case xAscender Height of the lower case k, b, or similar letterDescender Position of the bottom of the lower case p or qThickness of Upper Vertical stroke thicknessCase Stems on upper case H or KThickness of Upper Horizontal Stroke onCase Cross-Strokes upper case E or FThickness of Lower Vertical stroke thicknessCase Stems on lower case k or lThickness of Lower Case Horizontal strokeCross-Strokes thickness on the fThickness of AuxiliaryCharacter StemsThickness of AuxiliaryCharacter Cross-StrokesHairline thickness Thickness of the cross bar on the e or the thin part of the o______________________________________\n(See, Appendix, page 13, ICFFontIODefs.

Since no special information on the actual character contours, beyond the contours themselves, is required to perform these computations, any font may be accepted as input. Height thickness metrics are obtained either by examining images of specific individual characters or by averaging amongst several characters. Optionally, if these values are supplied externally, that is, the provider of the font provides these values, the external values may be used instead of the computed values. Edge positions are determined by looking for long vertical or horizontal portions of contours. Normal vectors are perpendicular to the contour, and are computed from contour equations and by determining which side of the contour is black and which side is white. For those points required for curve reconstruction, but which are not on the curve, the normals are calculated as if a normal vector extended from the curve through those points.\nIn the attached Appendix, the source code, in the MESA language of the Xerox Corporation, is provided demonstrating one possible embodiment of the source code to accomplish the described goals. The Mesa programming language operates on a microprocessor referred to as the Mesa microprocessor, which has been well documented, for example, in Xerox Development Environment, Mesa Language Manual, Copyright 1985 Xerox Corporation, Part No. 610E00170. This particular software is derived from the Typefounders product of the Xerox Corporation, Stamford, Conn. The Typefounders product accomplished all these character and font metrics, but did not provide them externally. (See Appendix, pages 67-319,for relevant Typefounder software modules called by software implementing the current invention including: CharacterOpsDefs.mesa, CharacterOpslmplA.mesa, CharacterOpslmpIB.mesa, pages 67-105; ContourOpsDefs.mesa, ContourOpslmplA.mesa, ContourOpslmplB.mesa, ContourOpslmpIC.mesa, ContourOpslmplD.mesa, pages 106-195; FontOpsDefs.mesa, FontOpslmpl.mesa, pages 196-221; ImageOpsDefs.mesa, ImageOpslmplA.mesa, ImageOpslmplB.mesa, pages 222-265 TypefounderUtilsdefs.mesa, TypefounderlmplA.mesa, TypefounderlmpIB.mesa, pages 266-319) Additional software was added, which makes these values available for subsequent processing (See Appendix, page 1, TypeDefs.mesa for translation of the Typfounder data structure; page 36, MetricsDef.mesa, Metricslmpl.mesa, for measurement of font metrics; page 47, EdgeOpsDef. mesa, EdgeOpslmpl.mesa, for measurement of leading and trailing edge position) and performs the perpendiculars calculations (see, Appendix, page 56, NormalOpsdefs.mesa, NormalOpslmpl.mesa). This information is used for creation of a data structure for \"hints\" (see, Appendix, page 13, ICFFontlODefs. Mesa for creation of hint format for next steps). Of course, while in the Appendix, the various coded algorithms operating on the contour font data for the hint creation step 20 are given in the Mesa language, implementation is easily made in the Unix-based \"C\" language. The remainder of the system, and the algorithms incorporated will be described in the Appendix in the Unix-based \"C\" language.\nSelecting a contour font for use enables a program that looks for font data, and designates its final position in an output, while calling the various programs forming the steps that will be described further hereinbelow (see, Appendix, page 320, raster.c). The contour font rasterization program herein described is useful on a variety of hardware platforms, attributes of which can be selected for enhanced operation of the system, such as for example, a greater degree of precision in the calculations (the difference between 8 bit calculation and 32 bit calculation). (see, Appendix, page 340, std.h)\nAt transform step 30, (see, Appendix, page 343, xform.c) the contour font is converted from arbitrary contour font units, which are supplied by the provider of the font, to a particular size, expressed in units of pixels. Typically, contour font units are provided in terms of the contour itself, i.e., the height or size of the contour font is one (1). That is, lengths of characters are placed in terms of the size of the font character itself. These values must be transformed into pixel unit values, or whatever other value is required, e.g. the scaled font may be 30 pixels tall. Additionally, it is at this point that the contour font is rotated for either landscape or portrait mode printing, as required. Rotation and scaling is accomplished in accordance with a previously determined transformation matrix equation 35, which mathematically determines the conversion of the contour font from font measurements to pixel values at a selected orientation which can be used by the printer. The transformed character H is shown at FIG. 2B.\nSubsequent to transformation step 30, at thickening or thinning step 40, font characters are thickened or thinned based on requirements of the transformation, and requirements of the printing process. The character contour is adjusted to make the strokes thicker or thinner to compensate for the xerographic or other marking process to follow. There are three components of the thickening or thinning value. The first compensates for xerographic or other imaging effects. That is, if for example, the marking technology will thin strokes by half a pixel, then strokes are thickened by half a pixel in this step. The amount of thickening or thinning specified in the printer profile 50 separately for X and Y directions, and is created at the manufacturer of the printer, and inserted at the printer profile 50. (see, Appendix, page 348, thicken.c)\nThe second component of thickening, called residual thickening, is applied to insure uniformity of output strokes after the sampling or rasterization step. This amount for horizontal thickening on upper case letters, for example, is equal to the difference between the calculated ideal output vertical stem thickness, which is obtained by scaling the font metric to the proper size, and the result of rounding that thickness off to the actual pixel width which will be obtained after rasterization. This rounding is performed to the nearest whole pixel if half bitting is not enabled and to the nearest half pixel, if half bitting is enabled. There are separate values for horizontal or vertical directions and for upper case, lower case and auxiliary characters.\nThe third component of thickening and thinning applies only to very small characters, and prevents drop-outs of fine lines. This amount is equal to the difference between the calculated scaled thickness of the hairlines, after thickening by the font thickening steps, and the minimum stroke thickness specified in the printer profile. When applied, this thickening brings fine lines up to the value of the minimum stroke thickness. The value is zero if the hairline is already greater than the minimum stroke thickness. (This process, referred to as \"adaptive thickening,\" is not disclosed in the source code in the Appendix.)\nThe actual thickening or thinning applied is equal to the sum of these three components. Each component has an independent value in the X and Y directions. The direction to move each contour control point is specified by its normal vector. The thickened character H is shown at FIG. C.\nAt step 60, the snap function or grid alignment function is applied. The coordinate system of the character is varied in the horizontal direction to move vertical and horizontal edges to positions where pixel boundaries will be after rasterization, i.e., to a whole pixel position. This is to assure uniform stroke thickness in the rasterized character images. The process is to piecewise stretch or shrink the character to force edges to align the pixel boundaries. On the left hand sides of the characters, the left edge of each stroke is moved to the closest pixel boundary, while the right edge of the stroke is moved to the pixel boundary specified by rounding the stroke thickness. This process gives priority to maintaining uniform stroke thickness over absolute stroke position. That is to say, that after the left edge of the character has been moved to a whole pixel position, the thickness of the stroke, or portion of the character, is examined to determine its thickness. The thickness has already been adjusted in the thickness of thinning step, so that it is close to a whole pixel width. Accordingly, the right edge of the character is then moved to the nearest whole pixel, based on rounding the thickness of the pixel, as opposed to moving the right hand side to the nearest pixel. On the right hand sides of characters, the rolls of left and right edges of strokes are reversed. Right edges of strokes are anchored, while left edges are rounded relatively to corresponding right edges. (see, Appendix, page 355, snap.c).\nIn one variant of this scheme, the positions of left and right index points or width points, which are those points which determine character spacing and are made to coincide in constructing words, are snapped before the vertical edges.\nIn the vertical direction, snapping is performed to piecewise stretch characters so that positions of baseline, cap-height, x-height, and descender fall on pixel boundaries. Baseline and descender position are treated as bottoms of strokes, that is, anchored, while cap-height and x-height are treated as tops of strokes, computed relative to the baseline. All characters are snapped to all of these positions, ensuring uniform character alignment. After these font metric positions are snapped, horizontal edges are snapped in the same manner as vertical edges, with lower edges of strokes anchored and upper edges snapped relative to the lower edges in the lower half of the character and upper edges of strokes anchored and lower edges snapped relative to the upper edges in the upper half of the character.\nIn both horizontal and vertical directions, snapping is performed one edge at a time. That is, the first edge is snapped, stretching the coordinate system of the character slightly on one side of the snapped edge and shrinking it slightly on the other side. The second edge is then snapped, with its pre-snapping position perhaps already modified slightly by the first snap. This sequential snapping helps preserve local character features better than simultaneous snapping of all edges does. When the second edge is snapped, its area of influence on the coordinate grid extends only up to the first snapped edge, which stays in place. This process is then repeated for the remainder of the edges. The snapped character H is shown at FIG. 2D.\nOnce each character in the adjusted contour font has been placed in the grid and appropriately thickened and thinned, the final step is to sample the adjusted contour on discrete grid. This step 70 can optionally produce half bitted output images, as controlled by the printer profile. Light half bitting produces half bitting on curves and diagonals, while heavy half bitting will also produce half bitted vertical and horizontal edges.\nRasterization in a preferred embodiment of this invention is in accordance with the process described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07\/416,211 by S. Marshall, entitled \"Rapid Halfbitting Stepper\", and assigned to the present assignee of the present invention. This application is incorporated by reference herein for the purposes of teaching rasterization. (see, Appendix, page 364, step.c and page 368, step.h for rasterization with halfbitting; page 372, bezline.c for stepping around curve; page 396, fill.c for filling). The rasterized character is shown at FIG. 2D.\nIt will not doubt be appreciated that numerous changes and modifications are likely to occur to those skilled in the art, and it is intended in the appended claims to cover all those changes and modifications which fall within the spirit and scope of the present invention.","id":"<urn:uuid:5cf8f2cc-bc5c-42e1-a62b-bddf45ac1cba>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.google.de\/patents\/US5459828","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.8994696736,"token_count":5093,"score":2.59375,"int_score":3}

Laurel wilt: A global threat to avocado production. World Avocado Congress. 186-197 In Proceedings VII World Avocado Congress. 5-9 September 2011, Cairns, Australia.\nInterpretive Summary: Laurel wilt is a lethal vascular disease of trees in the plant family Lauraceae, including avocado. It is caused by a fungal pathogen (Raffaelea lauricola) that is introduced into host trees by an exotic wood-boring beetle, the redbay ambrosia beetle (Xyleborus glabratus). The beetle was first detected in Georgia in 2002, and since has spread to six states in the southeastern U.S. Laurel wilt poses an imminent threat to commercial avocado production in south Florida, and a future threat to avocado in California, Mexico, Central and South America. Scientists at the USDA-ARS Subtropical Horticulture Research Station, in collaboration with the University of Florida, are conducting multidisciplinary research on the pest complex, including (1) evaluation of fungicides for laurel wilt, (2) screening for disease resistant avocado varieties, (3) determination of pathways for disease transmission, (4) identification of beetle attractants, repellents, and insecticides, and (5) assessment of host preferences. Information from these studies will be used by avocado growers and by state and federal action agencies engaged in monitoring programs for redbay ambrosia beetle.\nLaurel wilt kills members of the Lauraceae plant family, including avocado. The disease has invaded much of the southeastern USA, and threatens avocado commerce and homeowner production in Florida, valuable germplasm in Miami (USDA-ARS), and major production and germplasm in California and MesoAmerica. Laurel wilt is caused by a recently described fungus, Raffaelea lauricola, which is vectored by an invasive ambrosia beetle, Xyleborus glabratus. Current research topics include: disease management with fungicides; identifying host resistance; vector mitigation with insecticides and repellents; host ranges of, and interactions with, the pathogen and vector; and transmission of R. lauricola via avocado seed, scion material, root grafts and pruning tools. Although highly resistant avocado cultivars have not been identified, screening work continues on additional cultivars and new germplasm. Effective fungicides (e.g. triazoles) have been identified, but cost-effective disease management will depend on improved measures for xylem loading and retention of these chemicals. Insecticides have been identified that reduce boring activity of X. glabratus and its attraction to avocado and other hosts, but much remains to be learned about their impact on disease management. Although the disease\u2019s host range is generally restricted to American members of the Lauraceae, nonhosts that attract the beetle are known. Raffaelela lauricola rapidly colonizes avocado after infection, but to low levels; tylose and gel induction in the host, rather than xylem obstruction by fungal biomass, are associated with impeded water transport and symptom development. Seed and fruit from laurel wilt-affected avocado trees do not appear to be infected by R. lauricola.","id":"<urn:uuid:f5bb6156-473c-456e-b20e-b29dce901e8a>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.ars.usda.gov\/research\/publications\/publications.htm?seq_no_115=280283","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.8892325163,"token_count":905,"score":3.0,"int_score":3}
{"text":"St. Anne, Patroness of Detroit\nSt. Anne was named by the Vatican as the patron saint of the Archdiocese of Detroit. We honor the mother of the Blessed Virgin Mary and prayerfully ask for her intercession.\nOne may pray to any saint for any intention, but a patron saint is seen as the particular advocate for a chosen place or activity.\nSt. Anne is the mother of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Though she is not mentioned by name in the Bible, we know of her through early Christian writings, the most important of which is the Protoevangelium of James, written in about 150 A.D.\nWe are told that Anne, the wife of Joachim, was advanced in years before her prayers for a child were answered. An angel appeared and told her she would conceive a child who \"shall be spoken of in all the world.\"\nSt. Anne's feast day is celebrated on July 26. She is known as the patron saint of equestrians, housewives, women in labor, cabinet-makers, and miners.\nDevotion to St. Anne became popular in the Christian East by the fourth century, and that tradition later spread to the Christian West. When the French began to colonize modern-day Quebec, they brought their devotion to St. Anne with them\u2014asking for her protection in the New World.\nThis devotion was planted on the banks of the Detroit River by the original French-Canadian settlers. Two days after Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac landed with 51 others in what is now downtown Detroit on July 24, 1701, they celebrated Mass and began construction of a church named after Saint Anne.\nToday, Ste. Anne de Detroit Church is the second oldest continually operating parish in the United States. As is now recognized by the Holy See, the church of Detroit was placed under St. Anne's protection from its very founding.","id":"<urn:uuid:8e1cef78-a3fc-4eeb-b94f-f8ec251e2e20>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.aod.org\/our-archdiocese\/history-of-the-archdiocese\/patron-saint\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9797120094,"token_count":386,"score":2.796875,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Science Fair Project Encyclopedia\nIndustrial Design is an applied art whereby the aesthetics and usability of products may be improved. Design aspects specified by the industrial designer may include the overall shape of the object, the location of details with respect to one another, colors, texture, sounds, and aspects concerning the use of the product ergonomics. Additionally the industrial designer may specify aspects concerning the production process, choice of materials and the way the product is presented to the consumer at the point of sale. The use of industrial designers in a product development process may lead to added values by improved usability, lowered production costs and more appealing products.\nProduct Design is focused on products only, while industrial design has a broader focus on concepts, products and processes. In addition to considering aesthetics, usability, and ergonomics, it can also encompass the engineering of objects, usefulness as well as usability, market placement, and other concerns.\nProduct Design and Industrial Design can overlap into the fields of user interface design , information design and interaction design. Various schools of Industrial Design and\/or Product Design may specialize in one of these aspects, ranging from pure art colleges (product styling) to mixed programs of engineering and design, to related disciplines like exhibit design and interior design.\nIn the US, the field of industrial design hit a high-water mark of popularity in the late 30's and early 40's, with several industrial designers becoming minor celebrities. Raymond Loewy, Norman bel Geddes, and Henry Dreyfuss remain the best known.\nIn the UK, the term \"Industrial Design\" increasingly implies design with considerable engineering and technology awareness alongside human factors - a \"Total Design\" approach, promoted by the late Stuart Pugh (University of Strathclyde) and others.\nFamous industrial designers\n- Egmont Arens (1888-1966)\n- Norman bel Geddes (1893-1958)\n- Henry Dreyfuss (1904-1972)\n- Charles and Ray Eames (1907-1978) and (1912-1988)\n- Harley J.

{"text":"A California-based company is attempting to introduce\nexpert crowdsourcing to oncology to try and ensure that each\ncancer patient gets the most appropriate treatment.\nCommons brings together leading physicians and scientists in\neach type of cancer to create an open-source wiki-style database\nthat will catalogue the different genomic subtypes of each disease\nand show how patients are responding to different treatments.\nThe project is based on the hypothesis that every\npatient's tumour is, to some extent, unique. Although most\ncancer drugs are tested individually in large-scale clinical\ntrials, the majority of physicians (70 percent) prescribe cocktails\nof drugs based on their individual experience and particular\ngenomic subtype of the cancer. By capturing, aggregating and\nanalysing the genomic and results data of these individual drug\nexperiments -- cross referencing them with the large scale clinical\ntrials and studies -- physicians might be able to more efficiently\nfind the most appropriate treatment for their patients.\nCancer Commons was set up by Jay \"Marty\"\nTenenbaum -- a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and\ncancer survivor who founded a range of e-commerce companies\nincluding CommerceNet and Veo Systems. He also\nfounded Enterprise Integration Technologies, the first company\nto conduct a commercial internet transaction, in 1992. More\nrecently he has focused on transforming healthcare, launching CollabRx, which uses computers\nto personalise cancer treatments and accelerate research (and which\npowers Cancer Commons).\nTenenbaum argues that there are thousands of studies that are\npublished each year, with only a handful of them getting national\nor international attention. Furthermore, there are hundreds of\nthousands of individual \"trials\" being conducted by doctors (some\n30,000 oncologists in the US, where the program is limited to for\nthe time being) who are experimenting with different cocktails of\ndrugs on their patients. Without one central place to store\nand access these studies, scientific and clinical advancement in\nthis field is being artificially held back.\nA major hurdle for the project is getting researchers to supply\ntheir data to the site, rather than hold out for a career-making\narticle in a peer-reviewed journal. Tenenbaum is frustrated by how\nlittle data is shared between peers and hopes that Cancer Commons\ncould mark the dawn of a new era of open-source science.\nTenenbaum told Wired.co.uk: \"There is lots of talking in\nfragmented silos, but we want to capture all of that in one place\nand expedite the process through which science turns into\nThe first stage of Cancer Commons is to create a database where\neach different type of cancer has a \"Molecular Disease Model\" (MDM)\n-- an expert-curated reference node that catalogues the known\nmolecular subtypes of a particular cancer, linked to relevant\npathways, diagnostic tests, approved and experimental therapies and\ncurrent clinical trials. Each is akin to a dynamic research paper\nthat reflects the latest scientific, clinical and technological\nadvancements. A rapid submission and dissemination process allows\neach MDM to be maintained online and continuously updated by cancer\nspecialists and moderated by editors.\nThe project is governed by an editorial board with an impressive\nset of credentials. The 18 specialists -- chaired by George\nLundberg, former editor-in-chief of Journal of the American Medical\nAssociation and of WebMD's online properties\nand e-Medicine --\ninclude a former FDA Commissioner, a former editor of\nScience and a former president of the American Society of\nSo far, only one model has been created, for melanoma. It\nincorporates 78,185 abstracts from research papers and information\nrelating to some 1016 clinical trials that are ongoing in the\nfield. Some 11 expert editors have been assigned to that particular\nMDM, including Dr David Fisher, the head of the dermatology at\nHarvard Medical School and Dr Keith Flaherty, from the department\nof medicine at Harvard Medical School. Over the coming year the\nplan is to create MDMs for other cancers including lung, breast,\nsarcoma, and lymphoma -- each with their own experts overseeing\nIn order to harness the power of the MDM, CollabRx is developing\napps that tap into the data to aid decision-making. For example,\nthe \"Targeted Therapy Finder\" can be used by doctors to help\nidentify genetic tests that map an individual tumour's unique\ncharacteristics, and then select potential treatments based on the\nfindings. By entering information about the particular tumour,\nthey'll be given options of tests that'll help narrow down the\nparticular subtype of cancer being dealt with (as categorised by\nthe MDM), and therefore find out which treatments are the most\npromising. They can then find information about trials that are\nlooking for patients with that particular subtype.\nThe view is to develop further apps that allow doctors and\nresearchers to submit clinical observations and outcomes and then\ncollaboratively analyse them to fine-tune the MDMs. Tenenbaum would\nalso like to see patients report how they're responding to\ntreatments. He tells Wired.co.uk: \"Over time I'd like the\nresults of lab tests to go directly into the database.\"\nHe doesn't underestimate the enormity of the task, admitting\nthat not all of the details are worked out yet and that the initial\nMDMs will \"almost certainly be incomplete and wrong in places\". He\nadds: \"We don't pretend that we are going to cure cancer. But we\nought to be able to improve the outcomes for some patients.\"\nTenenbaum wants to make applications that are so compelling to\ndoctors that they'll have to use them to stay relevant in their\nfields. \"I see possibilities to slash time and development of new\ndrugs and improve patient care.\"","id":"<urn:uuid:261b3732-bc1b-48c7-9ed5-c7eb4c1cba6d>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.wired.co.uk\/news\/archive\/2011-02\/01\/cancer-commons","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9305593967,"token_count":1246,"score":2.703125,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Bali Climate conference has a message for rural community\nThe world leaders recognised that 20% of the global emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) can be contained by forestation. The programme, Reducing Emissions From Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) aims to compensate the developing countries in the tropical region to maintain their forests and discourages deforestation. It allows developing countries to sell carbon offsets to rich countries in return for not burning their tropical forests from 2013.\nREDD initiative is the need of the hour when largescale deforestation is taking place across the world for urbanisation, oil palm, soyabean and bio-fuel crop plantation.\nThe Bali conference also stressed upon the urgent need to cut carbon and methane emissions from tropical forests.\nThe Bali conference also adopted a resolution on adaptation fund to help poor nations to cope with damage from climate change impact like droughts, extreme weather conditions or rising seas. The Adaptation Fund now comprises only about $36 million but might rise to $1-$5 billion a year by 2030, if investments in green technology in developing nations surges. The fund distinguished the responsibilities of the Global Environment Facility and the World Bank. The fund would have a 16-member board largely from developing countries and would start operating from 2008.\nSenior researchers of the United Nations Development Fund (UNDP) had urged the developed countries to urgently discuss adaptation funds as the key to solution of the problems. The Lead author of the recent UNDP report, Kevin Watkins said that as per estimate $86 billion annually. \"The figure looks large, but actually it is only 0.2% of the rich countries GDP,\" he said and added that adaptation fund sourced from multilateral funding in the last two years was only $26 million\u2014the amount spent by UK alone on flood control for a week.\nA group of small island communities led by Biotani Indonesia Foundation has urged that the adaptation fund should include a special corpus to cover their initiatives.\nThe Bali conference succeeded in adopting a resolution on technology tranfer and also Its monitoring.

(The most common interval for external reporting is the fiscal year).|\n|Common Financial Reporting Conventions, Number of reporting periods||The number of reporting periods included in a given financial statement presentation, Both U.S. GAAP and IFRS require firms to include results for multiple reporting periods in each report.|\n|Common Financial Reporting Conventions, Monetary amounts||This includes measuring units, like thousands, millions, or billions, and the currency, such as dollars ($), euros (\u20ac), or Swedish kronor (SEK)|\n|Common Financial Reporting Conventions, Terminology and level of detail in the financial statements||U.S. GAAP and IFRS contain broad guidance on what the financial statements must contain, but neither system completely specifies the level of detail or the names of accounts. Therefore, some variation occurs.|\n|Characteristics of a Balance Sheet||A Balance Sheet:|\n1. is also known as a statement of financial position;\n2. provides information at a point in time;\n3. lists the firm's assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity and provides totals and subtotals; and\n4. can be represented as the Basic Accounting Equation.\nAssets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity\n|Accounting Equation Components|| 1. Assets|\n3. Share Holder's Equity\n|Assets|| Assets are economic resources with the potential to provide future economic benefits to a firm. |\nExamples: Cash, Accounts Receivable, Inventories, Buildings, Equipment, intangible assets (like Patents)\n|Liabilities|| Liabilities are creditors' claims for funds, usually because they have provided funds, or goods and services, to the firm.|\nExamples: Accounts Payable, Unearned Income, Notes Payable, Buildings, Accrued Salaries\n|Shareholders' Equity|| Shareholders' Equity shows the amounts of funds owners have provided and, in parallel, their claims on the assets of a firm. |\nExamples: Common Stock, Contributed Capital, Retained Earnings\n|What are the separate sections on a Balance Sheet (Balance sheet classification)||1. Current assets represent assets that a firm expects to turn into cash, or sell, or consume within approximately one year from the date of the balance sheet (i.e., accounts receivable and inventory).|\n2. Current liabilities represent obligations a firm expects to pay within one year (i.e., accounts payable and salaries payable).\n3. Non-current assets are typically held and used for several years (i.e., land, buildings, equipment, patents, long-term security investments).\n4.

The income statement links the balance sheet at the beginning of the period with the balance sheet at the end of the period.|\n2. Retained Earnings is increased by net income and decreased by dividends.\n|Statement of Cash Flows|| The statement of cash flows (also called the|\ncash flow statement) reports information about\ncash generated from or used by:\n2. investing, and\n3. financing activities during specified time periods.\nThe statement of cash flows shows where the firm obtains or generates cash and where it spends or uses cash.\n|Classification of Cash Flows|| 1. Operations: |\ncash from customers less cash paid in carrying out the firm's operating activities\ncash paid to acquire noncurrent assets less amounts from any sale of noncurrent assets\ncash from issues of long-term debt or new capital less dividends\n|Inflows and Outflows of Cash|\n|The Relationship of the Statement of Cash Flows to the Balance Sheet and Income Statement||-The statement of cash flows explains the change in cash between the beginning and the end of the period, and separately displays the changes in cash from operating, investing, and financing activities.|\n-In addition to sources and uses of cash, the statement of cash flows shows the relationship between net income and cash flow from operations.\n|Statement of Shareholders' Equity||This statement displays components of shareholders' equity, including common shares and retained earnings, and changes in those components.|\n|Other Items in Annual Reports||Financial reports provide additional explanatory material in the schedules and notes to the financial statements.|\n|Who are the 4 main groups of people involved with the Financial Reporting Process|| 1. Managers and governing boards of reporting entities.|\n2. Accounting standard setters\nand regulatory bodies.\n3. Independent external auditors.\n4. Users of financial statements.\n|What is the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)?||An agency of the federal government, that has the legal authority to set acceptable accounting standards and enforce securities laws.|\n|What is the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)?||a private-sector body comprising five voting members, to whom the SEC has delegated most tasks of U.S. financial accounting standard-setting.|\n|GAAP||1.

Standards set by the IASB are International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).|\n-The FASB and IASB Boards are working toward converging their standards, based on an agreement reached in 2002 and updated since then.\n|Auditor's Opinion||Firms whose common stock is publicly traded are required to get an opinion by an independent auditor who:|\n1.Assesses the effectiveness of the firm's internal control system for measuring and reporting business transactions\n2.Assesses whether the financial statements and notes present fairly a firm's financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles\n|Basic Accounting Conventions and Concepts||1. Materiality is the qualitative concept that financial reports need not include items that are so small as to be meaningless to users of the reports.|\n2. The accounting period convention refers to the uniform length of accounting reporting periods.\n3. Interim reports are often prepared for periods shorter than a year. However, preparing interim reports does not eliminate the need to prepare an annual report.\n|Cash vs. Accrual Accounting||Cash basis|\nA firm measures performance from selling goods and providing services as it receives cash from customers and makes cash expenditures to providers of goods and services.\nA firm recognizes revenue when it sells goods or renders services and recognizes expenses in the period when the firm recognizes the revenues that the costs helped produce.\n|What Is an Account? How Do You Name Accounts?||-An account represents an amount on a line of a balance sheet or income statement (i.e., cash, accounts receivable, etc.).|\n-There is not a master list to define these accounts since they are customized to fit each specific business's needs.\n-Accountants typically follow a conventional naming system for accounts, which increases communication.\n|What Accounts Make up the Typical Balance Sheet?|\n|Current assets and current liabilities (Balance Sheet Classifications)||Receipt or payment of assets that the firm expects will occur within one year or one operating cycle.|\n|Noncurrent assets and noncurrent liabilities (Balance Sheet Classifications)||Firm expects to collect or pay these more than one year after the balance sheet date.|\n|Duality Effects of the Balance Sheet Equation (Assets = Liabilites + Shareholders' Equity)||Any single event or transaction will have one of the following four effects or some combination of these effects:|\n1.INCREASE an asset and INCREASE either a liability or shareholders' equity.\n2.DECREASE an asset and DECREASE either a liability or shareholders' equity.\n3.INCREASE one asset and DECREASE another asset.\n4.INCREASE one liability or shareholders' equity and DECREASE another liability or shareholders' equity.\nA T-account is a device or convention for organizing and accumulating the accounting entries of transactions that affect an individual account, such as Cash, Accounts Receivable, Bonds Payable, or Additional Paid-in Capital.\n|T-Account Conventions: Assets|\n|T-Account Conventions: Liabilities|\n|T-Account Conventions: Shareholders' Equity|\n|Debit vs. Credit|\nWhile T-accounts are useful to help analyze how individual transactions flow and accumulate within various accounts, journal entries formalize the reasoning that supports the transaction.\nThe attached standardized format indicates the accounts and amounts, with debits on the first line and credits (indented) on the second line:\n| Revenue or Sales:|\n(Common Income Statement Terms)\n|Assets received in exchange for goods sold and services rendered.|\n| Cost of Goods Sold:|\n(Common Income Statement Terms)\n|The cost of products sold.|\n| Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A):|\n(Common Income Statement Terms)\n|Costs incurred to sell products\/services as well as costs of administration.|\n| Research and Development (R&D) Expense:|\n(Common Income Statement Terms)\n|Costs incurred to create\/develop new products, processes, and services.|\n| Interest Income:|\n(Common Income Statement Terms)\n|Income earned on amounts lent to others or from investments in interest-yielding securities.|\n|Unique Relationships Exist Between the Balance Sheet and the Income Statement|\n|Important Account Differences||1. Balance sheet accounts are permanent accounts in the sense that they remain open, with nonzero balances, at the end of the reporting period.|\n2. In contrast, income statement accounts are temporary accounts in the sense that they start a period with a zero balance, accumulate information during the reporting period, and have a zero balance at the end of the reporting period.\n|The Financial Statement Relationships can be summarized as:|\n-After preparing the end-of-period income statement, the accountant transfers the balance in each temporary revenue and expense account to the Retained Earnings account.\n-This procedure is called closing the revenue and expense accounts. After transferring to Retained Earnings, each revenue and expense account is ready to begin the next period with a zero balance.\n|Expense and Revenue Transactions|\n|Dividend Declaration and Payment|\n|Issues of Capital Stock|\n|Posting||1. After each transaction is recognized by a journal entry, the information is transferred in the accounting system via an activity known as posting.|\n2. The balance sheet ledger accounts (or permanent accounts) where these are posted begin each period with a balance equal to the ending balance of the previous period.\n3.The income statement ledger accounts (or temporary accounts) have zero beginning balances.\n|Adjusting Entries|| There are some journal entries that are not triggered by a transaction or exchange.|\n-Rather, journal entries known as adjusting entries, result from the passage of time at the end of an accounting period or are used to correct errors (more commonly known as correcting entries).\n|Four Basic Types of Adjusting Entries|| 1.Unearned Revenues|\n|Closing Process||1. After adjusting and correcting entries are made, the income statement can be prepared.|\n2. Once completed, it is time to transfer the balance in each temporary revenue and expense account to the Retained Earnings account. This is known as the closing process.\n3. Each revenue account is reduced to zero by debiting it and each expense account is reduced to zero by crediting it.\n4. The offset account\u2014Retained Earnings\u2014is credited for the amount of total revenues and debited for the amount of total expenses.\n5. Thus, the balance of ending Retained Earnings for a period shows the difference between total revenues and total expenses.\n|Preparation of the Balance Sheet||1. After the closing process is completed, the accounts with nonzero balances are all balance sheet accounts.|\n2. We can use these accounts to prepare the balance sheet as at the end of the period.\n3. The Retained Earnings account will appear with all other balance sheet accounts and now reflects the cumulative effect of transactions affecting that account.\n|Final Step in Preparing Financial Statements: The Cash Flow Statement||1. The statement of cash flows describes the sources and uses of cash during a period and classifies them into operating, investing, and financing activities.|\n2. It provides a detailed explanation for the change in the balance of the Cash account during that period.\n3.

{"text":"St. Francis, Animals and the Environment\nDr. Marcellino D'Ambrosio\nYou often see a garden statue of him with a bird on his shoulder. Yes, St. Francis of Assisi did have a special relationship with animals. He preached to the birds, pacified a wolf, and put together an animal cast for what is regarded as the very first live nativity scene.\nBut he had no interest in \u201cthe environment.\u201d No feeling for it whatsoever.\nInstead, he was in love with creation. And that\u2019s because he was in love with the Creator, who he regarded not as some cosmic force or distant, detached monarch, but as \u201cFather.\u201d He so much loved God his Father that he had great affection for anything related to God \u2013 the sacraments, the Church, its very imperfect ministers, broken down country chapels, and all of God\u2019s marvelous works of art \u2013 human beings first and foremost, but also the animals and even the inanimate objects that adorn the heavens and the earth.\nThe fondness for and kinship St. Francis felt with \u201cbrother son and sister moon\u201d was truly a gift. But it is gift that we all receive when we receive the Holy Spirit since it is one of the seven gifts mentioned in Isaiah 11:2-3. At least this is how St. Thomas Aquinas and many after him explained this beautiful, supernatural gift of piety. The natural virtue of piety was extolled by the Greeks and Romans \u2013 a love of those who gave you life, first and foremost your parents and after them, your fatherland. This entailed also a respect and affection for all that is connected with your parents and dear to them as well\u2013 your grandparents, uncles and aunts, and in the case of your country, its flag, its national anthem, its history and its heros. The term for piety towards one\u2019s country is \u201cpatriotism\u201d which actually has at its root, the term \u201cpater\u201d or \u201cfather.\u201d\nSt. Francis loved his home town of Assisi. But his deeper patriotism was for the Kingdom of God. His affection for the Kingdom included respect and reverence for all the King\u2019s creatures and subjects, whether they be great or small.\nNow, this does not mean that Francis saw all creatures as his equals, as some animal rights advocates today seem to do. One animal rights philosopher, Peter Singer, goes so far as to teach that adult whales and chimpanzees are actually superior to human fetuses and infants in both dignity and value. He would save the whales but allow both abortion and infanticide.\nSt. Francis would be appalled at such a concept. Biblical person that he was, he understood that woman and man are God\u2019s supreme masterpieces, made in His image and likeness, unlike the animals. Human beings are given dominion over the rest of creation in Genesis 2 not to exploit however, but to cultivate, care for, and perfect. God entrusts Adam and Eve not with \u201cthe environment,\u201d but with \u201cthe Garden\u201d \u2013 a place of beauty in which we are made to walk with God.\nSo St. Francis loves the birds, but also presses them into the service of the gospel. He saves the wolf of Gubbio from the wrath of angry townspeople, but rebukes it for its ferocity and calls men and wolf to live everafter in harmony. And the animals of the nativity scene? They are companions of the infant who is the Word made flesh.\nSo the authentic biblical and Catholic approach to \u201cthe environment\u201d is not to see it coldly and scientifically as \u201cthe environment.\u201d But rather, in the fashion of St. Francis, to approach it as the expression of the Father\u2019s beauty, as the gift of the Father\u2019s love, as an icon, a window to the new creation. Reckless exploitation would never fit with such a vision. But neither would some secular environmentalism.\nFollow Us -\nJoin us on Facebook\nJoin us on Twitter\nDr. Marcellino D\u2019Ambrosio writes from Texas.

You can't expect to deepen a relationship with God talking with Him only once a week! But how, in the midst of the busy, noisy life we all lead, can we develop a pattern of daily prayer that really works? And if we are successful in carving out some moments for prayer, what do we do? How should we spend that time in way that would be most fruitful?\nDr. Marcellino D'Ambrosio has taught spiritual theology academically, but, more importantly, he's had plenty of practice applying that tradition to everyday life. With a family of seven, a business, and a non-profit corporation to run, he knows the challenges that a busy, active life can pose to the Christian who wants to pray. In this talk, he lays down principles and gives practical suggestions on how busy laypeople can develop a prayer life that leads to joy and personal transformation.\nCD - $8.95\nThe Seven Deadly Sins - 3 CD Set\nWhat are the Seven Deadly Sins? There are books written about them and movies made about them, but what are they?\nFrom about the fifth century, Christian spiritual writers identified seven patterns of sin that, if not broken, would lead to spiritual death. In this fascinating series by Dr. Marcellino D'Ambrosio, we learn the destructive, addictive dynamics of these seven vices and how they infiltrate, and ultimately take over people's lives. Most importantly, we find out how to get free of the chains forged by these sins and the necessary qualities to cultivate to make us immune to them in the future.\nBeyond the Birds and the Bees\n\"The Talk.\" It's one of the most daunting prospects parents face. Communicating the richness of Catholic teaching on sexuality in a faithful and effective way can be an overwhelming responsibility. But does it have to be so?\nIn this thoroughly revised version of Beyond the Birds and the Bees, Greg and Lisa Popcak empower you with the tools needed to move well beyond \"the Talk\" by offering a comprehensive guide to raising sexually whole and holy children.

{"text":"HVAC Career Information\nT he world outdoors is often an uncomfortable place. Weather changes can bring precipitation, blustery winds, and extreme temperatures. That's why we turn to the shelter of indoor spaces. We rely on climate-controlled environments to carry out our lives comfortably and effectively. But it takes much more than just a few walls, a roof, and insulation to make it all happen. So, what is HVAC?\nWhat is HVAC and HVAC\/R?\nHVAC stands for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. The HVAC systems in our homes, offices, shopping malls, and other buildings allow us to live inside without too much concern for what's happening outside. But HVAC goes beyond the regulation of indoor temperatures. When such systems are properly installed and maintained, they contribute to better airflow and healthier indoor air quality, which is especially important for people with allergies, asthma, or other medical issues.\nIn addition to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning, there is another type of climate-control technology that is crucial to modern life. The \"R\" in HVAC\/R stands for refrigeration. The storage and transport of perishable foods, medicines, and other items we may take for granted is made possible by today's commercial refrigeration systems. (Side note: Don't be confused by the different ways in which the \"R\" is added to HVAC. The subtle variations you might encounter\u2014HVAC&R, HVAC\/R, HVACR, HVAC-R, or HVAC R\u2014all mean the same thing.)\nAdvances in HVAC technology are making the heating and cooling of new and retrofitted buildings more and more energy efficient. Refrigerants are being developed and used that are more environmentally friendly. And technologies such as hydronics (water-based heating), geothermal, and solar-powered heating and cooling are turning the HVAC profession into one with a growing number of \"green\" jobs.\nHVAC systems are installed and serviced by HVAC technicians (who are sometimes known as HVAC mechanics or HVAC installers).\nWhat Does an HVAC Technician Do?\nThe work of an HVAC technician can be rather varied. From installation to routine maintenance to repair, the many duties of a professional in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning industry often add up to working days full of diverse activities. However, a lot depends on whether or not an HVAC technician chooses to specialize in working with a particular type of equipment (i.e., residential, light commercial, or commercial\/industrial) in either the installation or service side of the business.\nSo, depending on their specialty, level of knowledge, and arsenal of skills, HVAC technicians carry out tasks that can include:\n- Installing furnaces, heat pumps, and air conditioning units\n- Installing the ductwork that carries treated air throughout a building\n- Following blueprints and specifications used in the installation of HVAC systems, including air ducts, vents, pumps, water and fuel supply lines, and other components\n- Connecting electrical wiring and controls\n- Performing routine maintenance on a variety of HVAC equipment, such as checking for leaks, adjusting blowers and burners, and checking nozzles, thermostats, electrical circuits, controls, and other components\n- Diagnosing and repairing problems that are found within any part of an HVAC system\n- Adjusting the controls of an HVAC system and recommending appropriate settings\n- Testing the performance of a furnace, heat pump, air conditioning unit or other piece of HVAC equipment to ensure that it operates at peak efficiency\n- Using carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide testers to make sure that a customer's equipment operates safely\n- Selling service contracts or replacement equipment to customers\nHVAC\/R technicians, sometimes known as refrigeration mechanics, install and service commercial or industrial refrigeration systems. In addition to some of the tasks above, HVAC\/R technicians have duties that can include:\n- Charging refrigeration systems with the proper refrigerant\n- Conserving, recovering, and recycling refrigerants for reuse or ensuring that they are disposed of properly since their release can be very harmful to the environment\n- Venting refrigerant into the appropriate cylinders\nTo perform their duties, HVAC and HVAC\/R technicians use a large variety of special tools (sometimes numbering in the dozens) such as:\n- Pressure gauges\n- Acetylene torches\n- Voltmeters, ohmmeters, and multimeters\n- Combustion analyzers\n- Soldering and brazing equipment\n- Pipe cutters\n- Gas detectors\n- Micron gauges\n- Tap and die sets\nWhere Can HVAC Technicians Work?\nWhether they specialize in installing or servicing residential, commercial, or industrial equipment (or all three), HVAC technicians perform their work on-site in a wide variety of settings. Any building that utilizes climate-control equipment will see multiple visits by HVAC technicians over the course of its lifetime. Such buildings can include:\nMost HVAC technicians work for independent service contractors. However, employment can also be found with:\n- Direct-selling retail establishments (e.g., HVAC equipment dealers)\n- Repair shops for commercial or industrial equipment and machinery\n- Merchant wholesalers of heating equipment and supplies\nWhat is the Typical Salary of an HVAC Technician?\nThe typical salary of an HVAC technician depends on many factors such as the type of HVAC job, employer location, level of experience, and whether or not a union is involved. When it comes to HVAC, salary is usually implemented in the form of hourly wages. Most HVAC technicians, regardless of their training, begin their careers at a relatively low rate of pay, but their wages rise gradually as they increase their skills, knowledge, and experience.\nSo, what are some average HVAC salaries? Based on national estimates, yearly wages for HVAC and HVAC\/R technicians break down this way: *\n- The bottom 10 percent earn $26,490 or less.\n- Median wages (50th percentile) are $42,530.\n- The top 10 percent earn $66,930 or more.\nThe pay scales of similar employers, even within the same city, can sometimes vary dramatically. HVAC\/R technicians that install and service commercial or industrial systems generally get paid the most. Unionized employers also tend to have much higher wages than non-unionized ones. However, you can expect a large chunk of your wages from any union job to go toward paying for union fees, insurance, and other benefits.\nMany HVAC technicians maximize their income by working longer hours during peak seasons (summer and\/or winter). Additional wages can also come, in some cases, from earning commissions on the sale of new equipment or service contracts.\nAre There Any Downsides to Working in the HVAC Trade?\nFor the people who turn it into a long-term career, HVAC is a lifestyle. Many HVAC technicians reap a great deal of personal satisfaction from their work. But, like any occupation, the field of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning has its upsides and downsides. It's not a career for everybody. You've got to be 100 percent committed in order to succeed.\nHere are some of the possible drawbacks of being an HVAC or HVAC\/R technician:\n- Physical hazards\u2014It can be grueling and hard on your body. Installing or servicing HVAC systems often requires heavy lifting, crouching, and kneeling\u2014including in tight places like attics and crawl spaces. Other physical hazards also exist such as the potential for cuts, scrapes, electrical shock, burns, or muscle strain. And, although rare, working with refrigerants without appropriate safety equipment can result in injuries like frostbite, skin damage, or even blindness.\n- Uncomfortable working conditions\u2014It frequently involves working outdoors in bad weather or extreme temperatures (hot and cold).\n- Mental fatigue\u2014In addition to being physically demanding, HVAC work can also be mentally tiring. That's because you must remain alert and focused in order to solve problems and avoid injury or costly mistakes. Plus, no matter how experienced you are, there is always a lot to learn. HVAC technology changes quickly, so being an HVAC technician requires staying on top of the latest developments and adding that knowledge to what you've already learned about older systems that are still in use. That makes the job sometimes feel overwhelming. As HVAC technology improves, much of it is also becoming more and more technically challenging to work on.\n- Fluctuating work hours\u2014Employment in the HVAC trade can sometimes be subject to seasonal fluctuations, particularly for technicians without much experience. It is common for many HVAC service technicians to work very long hours during peak seasons (summer and winter) followed by a reduction in hours (often less than full time) during the slower seasons. The peak seasons can be extra difficult if you have a family since working overtime and being on call at all hours (including weekends) can mean you're not able to spend as much quality time with those you care about. On the other hand, slow weeks are also inevitable, so you have to know how to account for the ups and downs in your personal finances.\n- Irritable customers\u2014Since many service calls happen when customers are in distress over failing heating or cooling equipment during extreme weather, HVAC technicians sometimes must deal directly with people who are cranky and impatient. Tempers are heightened when a problem can't be fixed right away because a part needs to be ordered.\n- Delayed gratification\u2014It takes time\u2014usually at least five years\u2014to develop the skills that enable you to begin making what are considered good wages in the HVAC industry. As a new technician, you should expect the starting pay to be lower than what you might be hoping for. You have to be willing to stick it out and learn everything you can in the meantime.\nWhat are the Good Things About Working in HVAC?\nThe downsides of being an HVAC technician are balanced\u2014and some might even say overcome\u2014by the many positive attributes of the HVAC trade. Here are a few of them:\n- A sense of accomplishment\u2014It can be intensely rewarding to fix problematic equipment or install new systems since it means that your hard work directly impacts the ability of people to feel comfortable in their environments. You have the chance to make someone's day if they were freezing (or sweating) prior to your arrival. Plus, looking back on a job well done often leads to a great feeling of personal satisfaction, regardless of how difficult it might have been.\n- Built-in exercise for mind and body\u2014Despite the occupational hazards, being an HVAC technician can help you stay in shape\u2014physically and mentally.\n- Variety\u2014Every day is bound to be somewhat different. You won't be stuck in an office. Instead, you'll get to solve a variety of problems and meet new people. And the fast pace of busy times helps the work days pass quickly.\n- Pride\u2014Because HVAC technicians can impact the well-being of people and the environment, they often feel a great sense of personal responsibility and pride of purpose.\n- Stimulation\u2014Opportunities for learning something new happen on a frequent basis, which means boredom is rare. As the HVAC industry moves closer and closer toward full computer automation for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems, the chance to develop advanced skills and knowledge also increases.\n- Long-term stability\u2014Once you've established yourself in the trade, there is great potential for making good money. And the job security can also be good. This is particularly true when you consider that HVAC skills are portable, and the work must be performed on location, which means that HVAC jobs are not subject to foreign outsourcing.\nWhat Personal Characteristics Do I Need for an HVAC Career?\nPeople who succeed as HVAC technicians possess key traits that enable them to handle the challenges of the occupation while taking advantage of the benefits. It's important to keep in mind that those who find long-term success and satisfaction in the HVAC trade generally possess the following characteristics:\n- A strong desire to help other people\n- A sense of craftsmanship and pride in their work (no cutting corners)\n- Physical and mental toughness\n- A courteous and respectful attitude\n- Pride in their appearance\n- An aptitude for mechanical, hands-on work\n- Strong interpersonal skills\n- Common sense\n- The ability and willingness to learn\n- Determination and a strong work ethic\n- An interest in the science behind HVAC technology\n- Good problem-solving abilities\nHow Do You Become an HVAC Technician?\nThere is more than one path to establishing a career in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. When asking, \"How do you become an HVAC technician?\" it is important to consider that there are essentially four different ways to begin going about it:\n- Obtaining formal HVAC training from a high school program or post-secondary school\n- Entering a formal apprenticeship program for your training\n- Joining the Armed Forces and receiving military HVAC training\n- Pursuing an entry-level HVAC position without any formal training and hoping that you find an employer willing to teach you everything informally on the job (an increasingly rare circumstance)\nEach option has its advantages and disadvantages. However, most employers generally consider formal training a must before they will even consider you for an open position.\nHere are some things to consider about post-secondary training at an HVAC school:\n- Most HVAC training programs at technical and trade schools take between six months and two years to complete.\n- Programs that last a year or less generally award a diploma or certificate of completion. Those that last two years usually award an associate's degree.\n- Shorter certificate or diploma programs are often designed only to teach students the basics of one of the three main areas of HVAC\/R: (1) residential heating and air conditioning, (2) light commercial heating and air conditioning, or (3) commercial refrigeration.\n- Most well-respected HVAC training schools offer programs that are accredited by at least one of the following agencies: HVAC Excellence, the National Center for Construction Education and Research (NCCER), or the Partnership for Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Accreditation (PAHRA).\n- Taking the right courses in high school can help you better prepare for HVAC school. These include subjects such as mechanical drawing, basic electronics, math, computer science, and applied physics and chemistry. It can also be beneficial to gain some basic knowledge of electrical and plumbing work.\n- HVAC schools are designed to give you a head start in the acquisition of your skills, but it will likely take a few years of working experience as an assistant HVAC technician after you graduate before anyone will begin to think of you as proficient.\nAnother popular and advantageous way to receive formal training is through an apprenticeship. Here is what you should know about HVAC apprenticeships:\n- In general, apprenticeship opportunities pop up only periodically depending on the needs of employers, both unionized and non-unionized.\n- Apprenticeships are often a pathway to national certification in the HVAC industry, and they can even allow you to earn college credits.\n- In order to reap all of the benefits of a formal HVAC apprenticeship, you'll want to find an apprenticeship program that is registered with the Office of Apprenticeship, which is part of the U.S. Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration.\n- Most apprenticeships allow you to earn a wage while you learn. And, if you are part of a registered apprenticeship program, your paycheck is guaranteed to increase over time. Unionized apprenticeships offer the additional advantages of working under the protection of a union contract and, usually, receiving insurance and pension benefits.\n- Apprenticeships usually last four to five years, and they include both classroom instruction and hands-on training on the job. After completing a five-year registered apprenticeship, you can become a journeyman in the HVAC field.\n- The organizations with the most HVAC apprenticeship opportunities include, in no particular order: (1) Air-Conditioning Contractors of America (ACCA), (2) Mechanical Contractors of America (MCAA), (3) Plumbing-Heating-Cooling Contractors (PHCC), (4) Sheet Metal Workers' International Association (SMWIA), (5) Associated Builders and Contractors (ABC), and (6) United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry of the United States and Canada (UA).\n- Apprenticeship openings are often highly competitive. Plus, you must meet the minimum requirements of whatever apprenticeship program you are applying for. Organizations that offer or coordinate apprenticeships in HVAC often look for candidates that have at least a high school diploma (or equivalent), good math and reading skills, above-average manual dexterity and hand-eye coordination, strong mechanical aptitude, patience, dependability, the ability to get along well with other people, and a desire to do whatever it takes to learn the trade. As part of the application process, you may also be required to take aptitude tests and attend multiple interviews.\n- Completing an HVAC program at a technical college or trade school can sometimes give you a leg up on the competition when applying for a registered apprenticeship.\nRegardless of how you get your HVAC training, there are a number of other things to keep in mind about the HVAC trade and finding work in it. Consider the following points:\n- Many employers look for HVAC professionals with at least two to five years of on-the-job experience. Schooling alone, while beneficial, is often not enough\u2014particularly for openings at larger companies.\n- In order to break into the trade and get the experience you need, you might have to spend a few years working for a smaller HVAC company at a lower wage than you might be expecting. The more you are willing to swallow your pride and do whatever is necessary to gain experience, the more opportunities you will have at the beginning of your career.\n- In many regions, you are more likely to land your first HVAC job during a peak season (summer or winter) since that is when demand for HVAC workers increases.\n- Employers want workers who will stick around for the long haul. That's why many of them prefer to hire people who've completed a formal HVAC program. Completing an HVAC education is a sign that you aren't just looking for a temporary job but, rather, have put your heart into making HVAC your career.\n- As you seek to gain experience early in your career, it's best to go for variety, if possible, in the type of HVAC work you do. Some people in the trade get \"stuck\" in just one particular area (such as installation) and find it difficult later on if they wish to move into a different HVAC specialty that they might enjoy better.\n- It pays to be assertive and proactive, especially when it comes to increasing your HVAC knowledge. You'll have better job security and advancement opportunities if you can become the \"go-to\" person for technical information and troubleshooting know-how about the equipment your employer sells and services. As you begin your career, it is essential to ask a lot of questions, pay close attention, and study, study, study. And, as you continue your career, the need to learn never stops. There will always be more to know.\n- Like in any other trade, the better you are at your job, the more quickly you can climb the HVAC career ladder.\n- It is impossible to learn everything you need to know in two years or less. So, although trade school can give you a great head start on the fundamentals, you should expect to begin your HVAC career in a \"helper\" or apprentice role as you continue to learn. It generally takes at least five years of on-the-job experience before you're ready to work on your own.\n- Since demand for HVAC technicians can sometimes be prone to seasonal fluctuations, it is important to learn how to manage your money in a way that allows you to ride out any downtimes comfortably.\n- Long-term success as an HVAC technician hinges a great deal upon your reputation. So it's important to develop a courteous and respectful attitude early on, to never cut corners, and to let the quality of work you perform speak for itself.\n- Persistence and enthusiasm are the biggest keys to landing your first job in HVAC. Employers look for people who are willing to commit to hard work. You can improve your chances of finding employment by always acting polite and professional, following up repeatedly with the people in charge of hiring, and demonstrating to them that you're not an arrogant \"know-it-all\" but are, instead, humble and ready to learn and take on all of the challenges inherent to HVAC work.\nHow Do You Get HVAC Certification?\nWhen asking, \"How do you get HVAC certification?\" it is essential to understand that some certifications are required while most others are voluntary. Even voluntary certifications, however, can help you advance in your HVAC career since most employers like to see official acknowledgment of your competencies.\nBut knowing how to obtain HVAC certification is just one aspect of this issue. You also need to understand what it all means. Here are the most important things to remember:\n- Regardless of which area of HVAC\/R you choose to work in, you will be required to obtain at least one type of certification from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Section 608 of the Clean Air Act of 1990 requires anyone who services equipment that uses specific refrigerants to take a test to prove that they know how to properly handle, recycle, and dispose of materials that can damage the ozone layer.\n- EPA Section 608 certification is broken down into four types depending on the kind of equipment you will be working with: (1) Type I for small appliances, (2) Type II for very high-pressure appliances, (3) Type III for low-pressure appliances, and (4) Universal for all types of HVAC\/R equipment.\n- HVAC students enrolled in formal training are often required to take the EPA Section 608 Universal certification test as part of their program.\n- Although not required by the EPA, R-410A certification covers an especially dangerous type of refrigerant in greater detail than what is found in the EPA Section 608 test. R-410A refrigerant is used at a much higher vapor pressure than other refrigerants and, therefore, requires different tools, equipment, and safety standards. R-410A is increasingly replacing some of the older ozone-damaging refrigerants that are being phased out.\n- Other types of professional HVAC certifications are designed to verify the real-world skills and working knowledge of HVAC and HVAC\/R technicians who've had at least a year or two of on-the-job experience. Certification is offered by independent organizations in many different specialty areas such as residential and commercial air conditioning, heat pump service and installation, gas heat, electric heat, oil furnaces, hydronics, air distribution, and commercial refrigeration.\n- The two most recognized providers of professional-level certifications in the American HVAC\/R industry are (1) HVAC Excellence and (2) North American Technician Excellence (NATE). Obtaining certification from these organizations involves meeting any necessary prerequisites and then passing written exams. You can also obtain your EPA Section 608 certification through such providers.\n- A certificate of completion (or diploma) from a formal HVAC training school is NOT the same thing as professional-level certification from organizations like HVAC Excellence or NATE.\nHow Long Do HVAC Classes Take?\nFormal HVAC programs at technical colleges and trade schools vary in length. A lot depends on the type of credential you're after and how in-depth you want your schooling to be. So, how long do HVAC classes take?\nHVAC programs that award certificates or diplomas typically last one year or less. Some take as little as about 18 weeks to complete. With these shorter programs, you often must choose to study just one of three specific areas: (1) light commercial air conditioning and heating, (2) residential air conditioning and heating, or (3) commercial refrigeration.\nAssociate degree programs in HVAC\/R technology, on the other hand, are designed to last two years and are often more comprehensive.\nHow Much Does HVAC School Cost?\nThe cost of HVAC schooling varies significantly depending on where you go to school and whether you choose to pursue a certificate or associate degree. So, how much does HVAC school cost?\nBasic program costs, including tuition, can range from as little as $2,000 or less to as much as $35,000 or more. The more expensive programs sometimes have a wider range of HVAC equipment and tools in their labs for better hands-on learning, although it is best to tour any school you are considering and check out their facilities to make sure you'll be getting good value for your money. Books and supplies are sometimes an extra expense and can cost as much as $4,500 depending on the program.\nFinancial aid in the form of loans and grants are frequently available from the federal government for those who qualify. And some states offer financial assistance through their own retraining programs for unemployed workers.\nWhat Can I Expect to Learn in My HVAC Training?\nHVAC schools are set up to teach the fundamentals of what you need to know to begin working as an HVAC technician at the entry level. Ultimately, HVAC involves learning at least the basics of about five different trades competently, including electrical work, plumbing, welding, pipefitting, and sheet metal.\nHVAC education programs vary in their curriculum, but the ones that are accredited by an industry-recognized organization generally share a number of common elements. Three of the biggest accrediting bodies for HVAC training are (1) HVAC Excellence, (2) the Partnership for Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Accreditation, and (3) the National Center for Construction Education and Research.\nMost HVAC programs combine classroom study with hands-on training. Depending on the school and program you choose, you can expect the curriculum to include subjects such as:\n- Electric, gas, and oil heat\n- Residential and light commercial air conditioning\n- Heat pumps\n- Basic electronics\n- Soldering and brazing\n- Venting and duct systems\n- Interpreting mechanical drawings and diagrams\n- Components of HVAC systems\n- General HVAC theory\n- Airflow and indoor air quality\n- Heating fuels\n- Refrigerant types and refrigerant oils\n- Installation and service\n- Troubleshooting and problem solving\n- Building codes and requirements\n- Tools and test instruments\n- Safety precautions and practices\nMany accredited HVAC\/R programs use the Industry Competency Exam (ICE) as an exit exam for students. So, depending on the program you choose, you might have to take one or more of the three different tests that are available as part of the ICE. The different testing areas are: (1) residential air conditioning and heating, (2) light commercial air conditioning and heating, and (3) commercial refrigeration.\nAs an HVAC Technician, Will I Need to Be Licensed?\nThe answer depends on where you intend to work. Licensing requirements for HVAC technicians vary greatly depending on the state or locality they work in and whether they intend to be their own boss. And some states don't have any legal requirements. In the ones that do, however, a state exam often must be passed. Plus, some states require you to have completed the equivalent of an apprenticeship program or two to five years of on-the-job HVAC experience before you can apply for a license to legally work on your own.\nThe content of state licensing exams also varies significantly. In some states, for example, emphasis might be placed on having an extensive knowledge of electrical codes, but, in other states, the focus might be more on HVAC-specific knowledge.\nJust remember: Although your state might not require you to obtain an official license in order to perform HVAC work, the federal government will still require you to be certified in the proper handling of refrigerants. The EPA Section 608 certification exam is a written test and is administered by a variety of organizations that have been approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, including unions, building groups, trade schools, and contractor associations.\nHow Promising is the HVAC Job Outlook?\nThe HVAC job outlook is expected to be excellent for the foreseeable future. In America, employment of HVAC technicians is projected to increase by 28 percent between 2008 and 2018, which is much faster than average. **\nThe growing demand for HVAC and HVAC\/R technicians can be attributed to a number of factors. As the nation's population grows, so does the number of buildings (residential, commercial, and industrial) that need to be fitted with climate-control systems. And the increasing complexity of new HVAC systems means an increasing possibility of their malfunction and need for servicing, which then requires skilled technicians. In addition, the growing focus on reducing energy consumption and improving indoor air quality means that more HVAC technicians are needed for analyzing the efficiency of existing systems and replacing old polluting ones with new, more efficient models.\nAlthough experienced HVAC technicians can expect excellent job prospects, the odds of new techs landing employment are best for those who have had training through a formal apprenticeship program, through an accredited program from an HVAC school, or both. You can also increase your chances of landing a good job by becoming an expert at increasing energy efficiency and gaining a solid understanding of complex computer-controlled HVAC systems such as those found in modern high-rises.\nWhat Kind of Advancement Opportunities Exist in the Heating, Ventilation,\nand Air Conditioning (HVAC) Industry?\nThe HVAC industry is incredibly diverse. Most HVAC technicians begin their careers in the residential and light commercial sectors of the field. Advancement usually comes in the form of higher wages or supervisory positions. But, with advanced knowledge, a lot of experience, and the right mindset, new opportunities can arise for entering other areas of the industry, which offer new challenges.\nCommercial refrigeration, for instance, is an area of high demand that requires workers with a lot of patience and specialized skills. With the right training and education, HVAC\/R technicians can also specialize in areas such as solar-powered or geothermal heating and cooling, retrofitting, system testing and balancing, efficiency evaluations, or building operations with advanced computer controls. In addition, some technicians move into teaching, HVAC sales and marketing, or managing their own contracting businesses.\nIt is even possible to earn a bachelor's degree in HVAC engineering technology. Such a degree could allow you to become an HVAC engineer or HVAC technologist and design new systems and controls for the manufacturing, commercial, institutional, or industrial sectors.\nHow Do I Get Started?\nOne of the best ways to discover whether HVAC might be a good field for you is to talk with a few experienced HVAC technicians. See if you can schedule a time to ride along with them on some service or installation calls. Or, if you're ready to get moving now, then check out our list of HVAC schools. You could soon have the repeated, satisfying experience of standing back and admiring a job well done.","id":"<urn:uuid:2544a8b7-2405-4749-8cfa-059c46bbfae9>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.trade-schools.net\/career-counselor\/hvac-technician-information.asp","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9547201991,"token_count":6747,"score":3.0,"int_score":3}

{"text":"12 Feb 13\nBiodiversity is a recent word. It was used for the first time in Washington in 1986 by an entomologist (Edward O. Wilson) and can be a misunderstood topic. In actual fact it should be a simple concept, because at its essence, it signifies nature, life itself, and the diversity of life on many levels - from the smallest and most basic (genes - the building blocks of life) to animal and plant species, up to the most complex levels (ecosystems). All these levels intersect and influence each other and each other\u2019s evolution.\nStudies from the University of Stanford have compared the species and varieties of an ecosystem to rivets that hold an airplane together. If we remove the rivets, for a while nothing will happen and the airplane will continue to operate. But little by little the structure will weaken and, at a certain point, just removing one rivet will cause the plane to crash.\nIn the history of the planet, everything has a beginning and an end, and in every era, many species have become extinct. But never at the horrifying rate of recent years, one that is a thousand times greater than previous eras.\nThis summer after a thorough study of many years, the prestigious University of Exeter in England declared that the earth is undergoing its sixth mass extinction (with the fifth, 65 million years ago, the dinosaurs disappeared).\nYet there is a substantial difference between this and the extinctions of the past: the cause. For the first time man is responsible. Man continues to destroy rainforests, cement the land, pollute waters and grounds with chemical pesticides and fertilizers, and accumulate plastic in the oceans. And he insists on excluding the earth\u2019s last custodians: those small-scale farmers, shepherds and fishers that know and respect the fragile equilibrium of nature.\nSlow Food started its work with biodiversity in 1997 and our foot in the door - that since the beginning has given us a unique perspective - was food.\nIf biodiversity disappears what will happen to our food?\nTogether with the plants and wild animals, the plants domesticated by man, breeds selected (for milk or meat) will also disappear. According to the FAO, 75% of plant varieties have been irreversibly lost. In the USA the figure is 95%. Today 60% of the world\u2019s food is based on three cereals: wheat, rice and corn. Not on the thousands of rice varieties selected by farmers that once were cultivated in India and China, or on the thousands of varieties of corn that were grown in Mexico, but on the few hybrid varieties selected and sold to farmers by a handful of multinationals.\nSlow Food\u2019s first intuition was this: look after domestic biodiversity. Meaning not just the panda or the seal, but also the Gascon chicken and the Alpago lamb; not just the edelweiss, but also the violet asparagus from Albenga.\nBut not just this. We became interested in taste and the knowledge connected to it, and traditional techniques of breeding, growing, and processing. And this led us to our second intuition: on our Ark of Taste \u2013 a catalogue of products to save \u2013 we have also included transformed foods: breads, cheese, cured meats, sweets. Because this is also biodiversity.\nOnce we had identified our field of action, how did we work? We linked diverse worlds that normally didn\u2019t interact: farmers, cooks, veterinarians, journalists\u2026 In order to achieve two objectives:\n1 \u2013 Help small-scale farmers:\nTo save a breed, we didn\u2019t start from genetic selection; to save an apple variety, we didn\u2019t start from a collection of varieties. Instead, we began by seeking out the shepherds that bred that certain breed, the farmers that still cultivated that apple, and we went and spoke to them. With this crucial step, the Presidia project was launched, that today is supporting producers in every corner of the world.\n2 \u2013 Raise awareness about biodiversity:\nWe need to work with producers and experts, but also with schools, journalists, restaurant and so on. We need to write and tell these stories of producers with every tool at our disposal, because these themes transcend university lecture halls and scientific institutions, and become the heritage of us all.\nBiodiversity can\u2019t be saved by scientists alone, nor by the powerful of the world, because it is of no interest to the market. And it\u2019s probable that Noah won\u2019t be arriving with his Ark.\nThis battle, therefore, is one that needs to be taken up by us, together with all the people we manage to involve, on our lands, every day - with our Ark of Taste, Presidia, Earth Markets, community and school gardens, and the thousands of other ideas still to come.\nBecause the battle to save biodiversity isn\u2019t like any other battle.\nIt\u2019s the battle for the life of our planet.\nSlow Food Foundation for Biodiversity General Secretary\nSearch the Slow Stories archive\nLatest Slow Stories\nItaly | 20\/05\/2013 | Buzzword, fad or innovative philosophy?

{"text":"Yesterday\u2019s House passage of cap-and-trade legislation designed to confront climate change is a landmark achievement, the first tangible step taken by the country that emits more greenhouse gas per capita than anyone in the world.\nThe bill itself still faces a tough test in the Senate.

{"text":"With the worlds energy needs growing rapidly, can zero-carbon energy options be scaled up enough to make a significant difference? How much of a dent can these alternatives make in the worlds total energy usage over the next half-century? As the MIT Energy Initiative approaches its fifth anniversary next month, this five-part series takes a broad view of the likely scalable energy candidates.\nOf all the zero-carbon energy sources available, wind power is the only one thats truly cost-competitive today: A 2006 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration put the total cost for wind-produced electricity at an average of $55.80 per megawatt-hour, compared to $53.10 for coal, $52.50 for natural gas and $59.30 for nuclear power.\nAs a result, wind turbines are being deployed rapidly in many parts of the United States and around the world. And because of winds proven record and its immediate and widespread availability, its an energy source thats seen as having the potential to grow very rapidly.\nWind is probably one of the most significant renewable energy sources, simply because the technology is mature, says Paul Sclavounos, an MIT professor of mechanical engineering and naval architecture. There is no technological risk.\nGlobally, 2 percent of electricity now comes from wind, and in some places the rate is much higher: Denmark, the present world leader, gets more than 19 percent of its electricity from wind, and is aiming to boost that number to 50 percent. Some experts estimate wind power could account for 10 to 20 percent of world electricity generation over the next few decades.\nTaking a longer-term view, a widely cited 2005 study by researchers at Stanford University projected that wind, if fully harnessed worldwide, could theoretically meet the worlds present energy needs five times over. And a 2010 study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory found that the United States could get more than 12 times its current electricity consumption from wind alone.\nBut impressive as these figures may sound, wind power still has a long way to go before it becomes a significant factor in reducing carbon emissions. The potential is there with abundant wind available for harvesting both on land and, especially, over the oceans but harnessing that power efficiently will require enormous investments in manufacturing and installation.\nSo far, installed wind power has the capacity to generate only about 0.2 terawatts (trillions of watts) of energy worldwide a number that pales in comparison to an average world demand of 14 terawatts, expected to double by 2050. The World Wind Energy Association now projects global wind-power capacity of 1.9 terawatts by 2020.\nBut thats peak capacity, and even in the best locations the wind doesnt blow all the time. In fact, the worlds wind farms operate at an average capacity factor (the percentage of their maximum power that is actually delivered) somewhere between 20 and 40 percent, depending on their location and the technology.\nSome analysts are also concerned that widespread deployment of wind power, with its inherently unpredictable swings in output, could stress power grids, forcing the repeated startup and shutdown of other generators to compensate for winds variability. Many of the best wind-harvesting sites are far from the areas that most need the power, necessitating significant investment in delivery infrastructure but building wind farms closer to population centers is controversial because many people object to their appearance and their sounds.\nOne potential solution to these problems lies offshore. While many wind installations in Europe have been built within a few miles of shore, in shallow water, there is much greater potential more than 20 miles offshore, where winds blow faster and more reliably. Such sites, while still relatively close to consumers, are generally far enough away to be out of sight.\nMITs Sclavounos has been working on the design of wind turbines for installation far offshore, using floating platforms based on technology used in offshore oilrigs. Such installations along the Eastern Seaboard of the United States could theoretically provide most of the electricity needed for the eastern half of the country. And a study in California showed that platforms off the coast there could provide more than two-thirds of the states electricity.\nSuch floating platforms will be essential if wind is to become a major contributor to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, says research engineer Stephen Connors, director of the Analysis Group for Regional Energy Alternatives (AGREA) at the MIT Energy Initiative. Wind energy is never going to get big if youre limited to relatively shallow, relatively close [offshore] sites, he says. If youre going to have a large impact, you really need floating structures.\nAll of the technology needed to install hundreds of floating wind turbines is well established, both from existing near-shore wind farms and from offshore drilling installations. All thats needed is to put the pieces together in a way that works economically.\nBut deciding just how to do so is no trivial matter. Sclavounos and his students have been working to optimize designs, using computer simulations to test different combinations of platforms and mooring systems to see how they stand up to wind and waves as well as how efficiently they can be assembled, transported and installed. One thing is clear: It wont be one design for all sites, Sclavounos says.\nIn principle, floating structures should be much more economical than wind farms mounted on the seafloor, as in Europe, which require costly construction and assembly. By contrast, the floating platforms could be fully assembled at an onshore facility, then towed into position and anchored. Whats more, the wind is much steadier far offshore: Whereas a really good land-based site can provide a 35 percent capacity factor, an offshore site can yield 45 percent greatly improving the cost-effectiveness per unit.\nThere are also concerns about the effects of adding a large amount of intermittent energy production to the national supply. Ron Prinn, director of MITs Joint Center for the Science and Policy of Global Change, says, At large scale, there are issues regarding reliability of renewable but intermittent energy sources like wind that will require adding the costs of backup generation or energy storage.\nExactly how big is offshore wind powers potential? Nobody really knows for sure, since theres insufficient data on the strength and variability of offshore winds. You need to know where and when its windy hour to hour, day to day, season to season and year to year, Connors says. While such data has been collected on land, there is much less information for points offshore. Its a wholly answerable question, but you cant do it by just brainstorming.\nAnd the answers might not be what wind powers advocates want to hear. Some analysts raise questions about how much difference wind power can make. MIT physicist Robert Jaffe says that wind is excellent in certain niche locations, but overall its too diffuse that is, too thinly spread out over the planet to be the major greenhouse gas-curbing technology. In the long term, solar is the best option to be sufficiently scaled up to make a big difference, says Jaffe, the Otto (1939) and Jane Morningstar Professor of Physics.\nConnors is confident that wind also has a role to play.

{"text":"Published May 2008\nProperly located digital signage in high traffic areas on school campuses provides students and faculty with a convenient resource to stay up to date about the latest school news and activities.\nSignage in Education\nBy Anthony D. Coppedge\nTechnology gets high marks.\nDigital media and communications have come to play a vital role in people\u2019s everyday lives, and a visit to the local K-12 school, college or university campus quickly illustrates the many ways in which individuals rely on audio and visual technologies each day. The shift from analog media to digital, represented by milestones ranging from the replacement of the Walkman by the MP3 player to the DTV transition currently enabling broadcasts beyond the home to mobile devices, has redefined the options that larger institutions, including those in our educational system, have for sharing information across the campus and facilities.\nFlexible And Efficient\nDigital signage, in particular, is proving to be a flexible and efficient tool for delivering specific and up-to-date information within the educational environment. As a high-resolution, high-impact medium, it lives up to the now-widespread expectation that visual media be crisp and clear, displayed on a large screen. Although the appeal of implementing digital signage networks does stem, in part, from plummeting screen prices and sophisticated content delivery systems, what\u2019s equally or more important is that digital signage provides valuable information to the people who need it, when and where they need it. On school campuses\u2014whether preschool, elementary, high school or post-secondary institutions\u2014it does so effectively, for both educational purposes and for the security and safety of staff, administration and the student body as a whole.\nSchool campuses have begun leveraging digital signage technology in addition to, or in place of, printed material, such as course schedules, content and location; time-sensitive school news and updates; maps and directions; welcome messages for visitors and applicants; and event schedules. Digital signage simplifies creation and delivery of multiple channels of targeted content to different displays on the network. Although a display in the college admissions office might provide prospective students with a glimpse into student life, for example, another display outside a lab or seminar room might present the courses or lectures scheduled for that space throughout the day.\nThis model of a distribution concept illustrates a school distributing educational content over a public TV broadcast network.\nAt the K-12 level, digital signage makes it easy to deliver information such as team or band practice schedules, or to post the cafeteria menu and give students information encouraging sound food choices. Digital signage in the preschool and daycare setting makes it easy for teachers and caregivers to share targeted educational programming with their classes.\nAmong the most striking benefits of communicating through digital signage is the quality of the pictures and the flexibility with which images, text and video can be combined in one or more windows to convey information. Studies have shown that dynamic signage is noticed significantly more often than are static displays and, furthermore, that viewers are more likely to remember that dynamic content.\nThough most regularly updated digital signage content tends to be text-based, digital signage networks also have the capacity to enable the live campus-wide broadcast of key events: a speech by a visiting dignitary, the basketball team\u2019s first trip to the state or national tournament, or even the proceedings at commencement and graduation. When time is short, it\u2019s impractical to gather the entire student body in one place or there simply isn\u2019t the time or means to deliver the live message in any other way.\nThe ability to share critical information to the entire school community, clearly and without delay, has made digital signage valuable as a tool for emergency response and communications. Parents, administrators, teachers and students today can\u2019t help but be concerned about the school\u2019s ability to respond quickly and effectively to a dangerous situation, whether the threat be from another person, an environmental hazard, an unpredictable weather system or some other menace.\nDigital signage screens installed across a school campus can be updated immediately to warn students and staff of the danger, and to provide unambiguous instructions for seeking shelter or safety: where to go and what to do.\nAlthough early digital signage systems relied on IP-based networks and point-to-point connections between a player and each display, current solutions operate on far less costly and much more scalable platforms. Broadcast-based digital signage models allow content to be distributed remotely from a single data source via transport media, such as digital television broadcast, satellite, broadband and WiMAX.\nThe staff member responsible for maintaining the digital signage network can use popular content creation toolsets to populate both dynamic and static displays. This content is uploaded to a server that, in turn, feeds the digital signage network via broadcast, much like datacasting, to the receive site for playout. By slotting specific content into predefined display templates, each section with its own playlist, the administrator can schedule display of multiple elements simultaneously or a single-window static, video or animated display.\nThe playlist enables delivery of the correct elements to the targeted display both at the scheduled time and in the appropriate layout. In networks with multicast-enabled routers, the administrator can schedule unique content for displays in different locations.\nIn the case of delivering emergency preparedness or response information across a campus, content can be created through the same back-office software used for day-to-day digital signage displays. Within the broadcast-based model, three components ensure the smooth delivery of content to each display.\nA transmission component serves as a content hub, allocating bandwidth and inserting content into the broadcast stream based on the schedule dictated by the network\u2019s content management component. Content is encapsulated into IP packets that, in turn, are encapsulated into MPEG2 packets for delivery.\nGeneric content distribution model for digital signage solution.\nThe content management component of the digital signage network provides for organization and scheduling of content, as well as targeting of that content to specific receivers. Flexibility in managing the digital signage system enables distribution of the same emergency message across all receivers and associated displays, or the delivery of select messages to particular displays within the larger network.\nWith tight control over the message being distributed, school administrators can immediately provide the information that students and staff in different parts of the campus need to maintain the safest possible environment. Receivers can be set to confirm receipt of content, in turn assuring administrative and emergency personnel that their communications are, in fact, being conveyed as intended. On the receiving end, the third component of the system, content, is extracted from the digital broadcast stream and fed to the display screen.\nThe relationships that many colleges and universities share with public TV stations provide an excellent opportunity for establishing a digital signage network. Today, the deployed base of broadcast-based content distribution systems in public TV stations is capable of reaching 50% of the US population. These stations\u2019 DTV bandwidth is used not only for television programming, but also to generate new revenues and aggressively support public charters by providing efficient delivery of multimedia content for education, homeland security and other public services.\nEducational institutions affiliated with such broadcasters already have the technology, and much of the necessary infrastructure, in place to launch a digital signage network. In taking advantage of the public broadcaster\u2019s content delivery system, the college or university also can tap into the station\u2019s existing links with area emergency response agencies.\nAs digital signage technology continues to evolve, educational institutions will be able to extend both urgent alerts and more mundane daily communications over text and email messaging. Smart content distribution systems will push consistent information to screens of all sizes, providing messages not only to displays, but also to the cell phones and PDAs so ubiquitous in US schools.\nThe continued evolution of MPH technology will support this enhancement in delivery of messages directly to each student. MPH in-band mobile DTV technology leverages ATSC DTV broadcasts to enable extensions of digital signage and broadcast content directly to personal devices, whether stationary or on the move. Rather than rely on numerous unrelated systems, such as ringing bells, written memos and intercom announcements, schools can unify messaging and its delivery, in turn reducing the redundancy involved in maintaining communications with the student body.\nAn effective digital signage network provides day-to-day benefits for an elementary school, high school, college or university while providing invaluable emergency communications capabilities that increasingly are considered a necessity, irrespective of whether they get put to the test. The selection of an appropriate digital signage model depends, of course, on the needs of the organization.\nEducational institutions share many of the same concerns held by counterparts in the corporate world, and key among those concerns is the simple matter of getting long-term value and use out of their technical investments. However, before even addressing the type of content the school wishes to create and distribute, the systems integrator, consultant or other AV and media professional should work with the eventual operators of the digital signage network to identify and map out the existing workflow. Once the system designer, integrator or installer has evaluated how staff currently work in an emergency to distribute information, he then can adjust established processes and adapt them to the digital signage model.\nThe administrative staff who will be expected to update or import schedules to the digital signage system will have a much lower threshold of acceptance for a workflow that is completely unfamiliar or at odds with all their previous experience. An intuitive, easy-to-use system is more likely to be used in an emergency if it has become familiar in everyday practice.\nTurnkey digital signage solutions provide end-to-end functionality without forcing users and integrators to work with multiple systems and interfaces. The key in selecting a vendor lies in ensuring that they share the same vision and are moving in the same direction as the end user.\nIn addition to providing ease of use, digital signage solutions for the education market also must provide a high level of built-in security, preventing abuse or misuse by hackers, or by those without the knowledge, experience or authority to distribute content over the network. Because the network is a conduit for emergency messaging, its integrity must be protected. So, the installer must not only identify the number of screens to be used and where, but also determine who gets access to the system and how that access remains secure.\nScalable systems that can grow in number of displays or accommodate infrastructure improvements and distribution of higher-bandwidth content will provide the long-term utility that makes the investment worthwhile. By going into the project with an understanding of existing infrastructure, such as cabling, firewalls, etc., and the client\u2019s goals, the professional is equipped to advise the customer as to the necessity, options and costs for enhancing or improving on that infrastructure. As with any other significant deployment of AV technology, the installation of a digital signage network also requires knowledge of the site, local building codes, the availability of power and so forth.\nRalph Bachofen, senior director of Product Management and Marketing, Triveni Digital, has more than 15 years of experience in voice and multimedia over Internet Protocol (IP), telecommunications and the semiconductor business.\nThe infrastructure requirements of a school in deploying a digital signage network will vary, depending on the type of content being delivered through the system. HD and streaming content clearly are bandwidth hogs, whereas tickers and other text-based messages put a low demand on bandwidth. Most facilities today are equipped with Gigabit Ethernet networks that can handle\nthe demands of live video delivery and lighter content.\nHowever, even bandwidth-heavy video can be delivered by less robust networks, as larger clips can be \u201ctrickled\u201d over time to the site, as long as storage on the unit is adequate. There is no set standard for the bandwidth required, just as there is no single way to use a digital signage solution. It all depends on how the system will be used, and that\u2019s an important detail to address up front.\nMost digital signage solutions feature built-in content-creation tools and accept content from third-party applications, as well. Staff members who oversee the system thus can use familiar applications to create up-to-date content for the school\u2019s digital signage network. This continuity in workflow adds to the value and efficiency of the network in everyday use, reducing the administrative burden while serving as a safeguard in the event of an emergency.\nFor educational institutions, the enormous potential of the digital signage network can open new doors for communicating with students and staff, but only if it is put to use effectively. Comprehensive digital signage solutions offer ease of use to administration, deliver clear and useful messaging on ordinary days and during crises, and feature robust design and underlying technology that supports continual use well into the future.","id":"<urn:uuid:4f104f5b-67cc-4de8-87a7-62cb466de5d1>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/soundandcommunications.com\/archive_site\/video\/2008_05_video.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9226340055,"token_count":2596,"score":2.5625,"int_score":3}

{"text":"As the Fukushima world disaster continues to unfold, we have learned that the strontium levels are 240 times over the legal limit near the plant, which has become an uninhabitable land area. The nuclear waste advisor to the Japanese government recently explained that roughly 966 square kilometers (km), or 600 square miles, around Fukushima are now uninhabitable due to the unfolding disaster. This massive dead zone area is equivalent in size to 17 Manhattan Islands placed next to one another. Unfortunately, the latest readings taken approximately 20 miles out to sea from the site showed radioisotope levels from all the radioactive particles were ten times higher than those measured in the Baltic and Black Seas after the massive Chernobyl disaster.\n\"Given that the Fukushima plant is on the ocean, and with leaks and runoff directly to the ocean, the impacts on the ocean will exceed those of Chernobyl, which was hundreds of miles from any sea,\" said Ken Buessler, Senior Scientist in Marine Chemistry at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, several months back. It has also been revealed that reactors 1, 2, and 3 have all experienced \"melt-throughs.\" This means the radiation materials have burnt through and gone directly into the ground and water. This is considered to be the worst possible scenario in a disaster of this nature.\n\"Dangerous levels of radioactive iodine and cesium have already contaminated the sea, the soil, groundwater, and the air,\" said reporter Mark Willacy of the Australian Broadcast Corporation in a recent Lateline interview. \"This week plutonium was detected for the first time outside the stricken plant, and Strontium-90, known as a \u2018 seeker\u2019 , because it can cause bone cancer and leukemia, has now been found as far away as 60 kilometers (37+ miles) from the facility.\"\nVarious atomic experts now agree that the unfolding situation is truly \"as serious as it gets in a nuclear disaster.\" Fukushima presently has 20 nuclear cores exposed, and it has 20 times the potential of Chernobyl to be released. This is without a doubt the worst nuclear disaster the world has ever seen.\n\"We are discovering hot particles everywhere in Japan,\" said Arnold Gundersen, a former industry senior vice president with 39 years of nuclear engineering experience.\nThe average number of infant deaths caused by the Fukushima radiation exposure multiple meltdown was 37 deaths in 4 weeks (an average of 9.25 per week), ending March 19th (prior to the disaster) and after 10 weeks, ending May 28th (post disaster), the number of deaths was 125 (an average of 12.60 per week). This is a 35% increase of perinatal mortality in infants under a year old, in 8 cities in the Northwest (Boise, Seattle, Portland, Santa Cruz, Sacramento, San Francisco, San Jose, and Berkeley). According to Joseph Mangano, Epidemiologist and Executive Director of Radiation & Public Health Project, the perinatal mortality rate in Philadelphia rose 48% 10 weeks after the meltdown.\nThe bad news, of course, is that this is an ongoing disaster, and the governments, for whatever unexplained reasons, don\u2019 t seem interested in sealing it off. Even though this ongoing radiation exposure and disaster is not being noted in the newspapers, and one cannot see it, smell it or detect it easily, it is still there and getting worse.\nEvidence of the ongoing danger of U.S. nuclear plants is the report by the Associated Press citing 48 out of 65 of the facilities reported leaking tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen. In other words, 75% of U.S. nuclear plants are leaking. It is confirmatory to hear that the U.S. commission blames many of the leaks on corroded buried piping. The significance of the leaking is that in 37 of the 48 sites, there was found to be contamination of the ground water that exceeded the federal drinking water standard. The good news is that no public water supplies are known to be contaminated, but it was found in private wells in Illinois and Minnesota. In New Jersey, tritium was found in a discharge canal feeding Barnegat Bay. This is not a recent phenomenon. In 2007 cesium-137 was found, along with tritium, at the Fort Calhoun plant near Omaha, Nebraska, and strontium-90 was found near New York City and the Indian Point nuclear site. All this just supports how important it is not only protect yourself against all forms of radiation with our supplement program, but also to attempt to create some reforms to protect the American public.\nThe threat that nuclear power poses to our nation is alarming, as our government recklessly moves to re-license old reactors and use tax dollars to help finance new plants. Even more frightening is the lack of evacuation plans for more than 111 million Americans who live within 50 miles of a reactor. Unfortunately, the U.S. government isn\u2019t learning the critical lessons from these nuclear energy disasters. Incredibly, our nation\u2019 s evacuation plans only include areas within 10 miles of reactors\u2014despite clear evidence from Chernobyl and Fukushima that serious radiation impacts extend much further. And our emergency medical capacities fall short of what\u2019 s needed to meet a major nuclear catastrophe. These dangerously inadequate emergency response plans put major U.S. urban areas at risk\u2014including New York City, Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C.\nThe significance of this censored news further supports the unsustainability and dangers of nuclear plants in the U.S. compounded by lax federal regulation. This is a dangerous situation that unfortunately is just waiting to happen. I suggest for the protection of our family, children, and the U.S. population that we exert every possible effort to follow the German example of making a commitment to dismantle all nuclear reactors by 2020 and certainly not to build new ones. That is the least we can do to put common sense and values of human safety above the interests of economic investment and profit of the nuclear industry. This dangerous nonsense is only going to be stopped if enough people complain.

{"text":"Elderly people are at increased risk of food-borne illness because as they age, their immune systems become weaker. In fact, the website for the Centers for Disease Control estimates that each year about 48 million people get sick, 128,000 are hospitalized and 3,000 die from food-borne diseases. The most severe cases tend to occur in the very old.\nThe good news is that food poisoning can be prevented if you follow proper home food safety practices.\nRuth Frechman, a registered dietitian and spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association, spoke with AgingCare.com about home food safety for elderly people. \"Since older adults are at particular risk for food-borne illness, good food safety habits are extremely crucial.\"\nMs. Frechman says three common cooking and food preparation mistakes can result in unsafe food and potential food poisoning.\nBacteria in raw meat and poultry juices can be spread to other foods, utensils and surfaces. . \"To prevent cross-contamination, keep raw foods separate from ready-to-eat foods and fresh vegetables,\" she says. \"For example, use two cuttings boards: one strictly for raw meat, poultry and seafood; the other for ready-to-eat foods like breads and vegetables.\"\nShe recommends washing cutting boards thoroughly in hot soapy water after each use or placing them in the dishwasher. Use a bleach solution or other sanitizing solution and rinse with clean water. Always wash your hands after handling raw meat.\nLeaving food out too long\nLeaving food out too long at room temperature can cause bacteria to grow to dangerous levels that can cause illness. \"Many people think it's okay to leave food sitting out for a few hours,\" Ms. Frechman says. \"But that's a dangerous habit. Food should not be left out for more than two hours. And if it's over 90 degrees, like at an outdoor summer barbecue, food should not be out for more than one hour.\"\nIts common knowledge that meat should be cooked to proper temperatures. However, most people don't know that even leftovers that were previously cooked should be re-heated to a certain temperature. Ms. Frechman says re-heating foods to the proper temperature can kill many harmful bacteria.\nLeftovers should be re-heated to at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit. \"Harmful bacteria are destroyed when food is cooked to proper temperatures,\" she says. \"That's why a food thermometer comes in handy not only for preparing food, but also for re-heating.\"\nHow long it is safe to eat leftovers? Not as long as you would think, Ms. Frechman says. Chicken, fish and beef expire after three to four days in the refrigerator. To help seniors track if leftovers are still good, she recommends writing the date on the package of leftovers.\nSeniors and their caregivers should take these preventive measures to avoid germs in food and contracting food poisoning.

{"text":"Take a look at this snapshot from Health Canada's website fact sheet entitled Healthy Lawn Tips.\n- Although it may look untidy, leave grass clippings on your lawn when you mow it to provide nutrient recycling.\n- Aerate compacted soil in the fall to help oxygen, water and nutrients reach roots.\n- Over-seed patchy areas.\n- In heavy traffic areas, replace grass with mulch or paving stones.\n- Check your lawn for early signs of pests and other problems such as holes caused by small animals digging for insects.\n- Set your mower so that your grass is seven to eight cm high to encourage deeper roots and help fend off weeds.\n- Water infrequently, but when you do, make sure you allow the water to get deep into the soil (about 1.5 centimetres) to promote deep roots. Over-watering starves the soil of oxygen and invites disease. Apply at least 2.5 centimetres of water. Put a container on your lawn to measure how much you've watered. An empty tuna can is about the right height.\n- Maintain good soil with ample depth and organic matter to prevent problems.\n- If physical control methods fail and you use a pesticide, be sure the one you pick lists the pest you are trying to control on the label, and follow all the instructions.\nMore information is available online at www.healthcanada.gc.ca\/pmra.

{"text":"Historical Aerial Photographs\nPrior to the trial, Jan Schlichtmann, the plaintiffs attorney, hired a consulting firm to acquire and analyze historic aerial photographs of the Riley 15-acre property to estimate the times when the various drums, barrels, and debris piles first appeared. The consultants took this analysis and compared it to the 1985 field mapping of the debris piles, drums, and tanks on the 15-acre property by John Drobinski, a geologist hired by Schlichtmann. Drobinski's field map can be downloaded from the trial documents collection and excerpts of his deposition can be downloaded from the trial testimony collection.\nWhat Are Aerial Photographs and How Are They Used?\nAerial photographs like the ones shown below routinely are taken by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Geological Survey to make topographic maps, record temporal changes in crop patterns, map geology and mineral resources, and evaluate floodplains. A specialized aircraft with sophisticated cameras is used to take photographs using black & white or color infrared film. The aircraft flies along flight lines that overlap slightly while the camera takes photographs at time intervals that allow the images to overlap. Because of the overlap is from two different positions in the sky, the overlapping portions of adjacent images can be viewed in 3-D. A stereoscope is needed to see the images in 3-D, which produces a static visual image that is similar to looking at a 3-D movie using red and blue glasses. Thus, tree tops and buildings appear to be higher than surrounding ground, whereas stream channels and wetlands appear to be lower.\nAerial Photographs of the Woburn Wells G and H Area\nThe collection below is a subset of those compiled by Maura Metheny for her dissertation research at Ohio State University. Four sets of photographs (May 1954, May 1969, April 1981, and March 1986) are suitable for 3-D viewing. To do this, print the images on high-quality paper or photographic paper and view them under a stereoscope. An inexpensive plastic 'pocket' stereoscope works well.

{"text":"By Tom Baxter\nA few years ago, Emory\u2019s Michael C. Carlos Museum hosted a fascinating exhibit based on the papyrus legal records of a family which lived in Egypt in the 5th Century BC. As a testament to the lasting lessons such archaeological treasures can transmit, it came to mind last week when Barack Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to endorse same-sex marriage.\nThe papyri were the legal documents of a couple, Ananiah, a Jewish temple official, and his wife Tamut, an Egyptian woman who\u2019d been sold into slavery as a child. They lived on the island of Elephantine in the Nile, in a time when Egypt was part of the Persian Empire and Jewish mercenaries guarded its southern border.\nAs it is today, relationships could be complicated back then. When she married Ananiah on July 3, 449 BC, Tamut was owned by another man, Meshullam, who didn\u2019t free her or her daughter for another 22 years. Things worked out, though. Later papyri record Ananiah giving Tamut part ownership of their house, selling a house to his son-in-law and making payments on a wedding gift for their daughter.\nThe records are a striking contrast of the bizarre with the familiar. The conventions of legalese have changed so little over the millenia that a modern-day lawyer would feel completely at home with these contracts. But the concept of marriage around which these legal proceedings revolve appears to have been radically different from ours today.\nThe contract between Ananiah and Tamut is so detailed that it specifies on which side of the stairs each is to walk up and down. But as far as the state was concerned, marriage contracts like theirs \u2013 the notarized enumeration of what one party could take the other to court for, if things didn\u2019t work out \u2013 was all the marriage was. Since Ananiah was a religious leader, there may have been a ceremony to sanctify the marriage within the Jewish community on the island, but over the whole of Egyptian society, the state\u2019s involvement in defining, protecting and preserving marriage was quite limited and specific to each coupling.\nIf government has developed a better way to deal with this complex aspect of human society, it was not in evidence last week, when North Carolina voters overwhelmingly declared their support for an amendment defining marriage solely as the union between a man and a woman, and Obama declared the next day that he\u2019d decided his \u201cevolving\u201d views on the subject and supports the right of people of the same sex to marry.\nBy comparison with other historic stands taken by presidents, Obama\u2019s carried remarkably little weight. The states decide this issue, and one just had. Obama\u2019s statement on a morning news show the following day was couched more as something which had been forced by Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s unguarded comments on the subject rather than the embarrassment of a big vote in the state where the Democrats will hold their convention this summer. This sounds progressively more fishy the longer you think about it, particularly when you hear how angry the Obama staffers sounded about Biden\u2019s goofiness, according to the reporters who repeated on-the-record what the staffers told them off-the-record.\nYet symbolically, Obama\u2019s statement was rightly looked on as an historic event. The North Carolina vote, which put into the state constitution what was already on the books as state law, was also largely symbolic. And lemme tell you \u2013 as former Gov. Roy Barnes might have said after his bitter experience with changing the state flag \u2013 symbolism is the rat poison of good government.\nShould government get more involved in marriage, as those on both sides of the current controversy would have it, or less? At present the states and the federal government find themselves in a cycle of ineffectiveness. Washington has no power over what the states define marriage to be, but because of the Defense of Marriage Act, signed by President Clinton, which prohibits same-sex couples from the rights and protections of marriage in more than a thousand federal laws, it really doesn\u2019t matter what the states do either. Because our modern concept of marriage \u2014 unlike the Egyptians \u2014 involves a certain fusion, long since blurred, between the provinces of religion and the state, we appear bound to debate state by state an issue which in some respects can only be settled congregation by congregation.\nNor does government at the federal or the state level have the ability to stop the steady decline in heterosexual marriage, as attested by a voluminous array of statistics on divorce, unwed mothers and single-parent households. In terms of the work hours it has to invest, government\u2019s biggest involvement with marriage today is the administration of breakups and the management of the carnage that often comes with them.\nAdministratively, things were much easier for Ananiah and Tamut, which makes it impossible to replicate the arrangements of their day. But their preserved family records challenge us to think about whether we\u2019ve really figured out what aspects of marriage government should involve itself in, and what it shouldn\u2019t.","id":"<urn:uuid:fbdcbf83-8cf4-45a2-a5f2-a351c443e142>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/saportareport.com\/blog\/2012\/05\/governments-role-in-marriage-an-issue-for-the-ages\/comment-page-1\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9767609835,"token_count":1069,"score":3.109375,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Such was the condition in Kansas at the opening of the presidential year of 1856, and it became one of the leading issues of the campaign. The whole country was aroused over reports from Kansas, and it was impossible that such a question remain long out of the halls of Congress, notwithstanding the claim of Douglas that his famous bill would remove the slavery question from national politics. In May, 1856, Senator Sumner made a powerful speech on \"The Crime against Kansas.\" The speech was a fearful arraignment of the slave power. But the speaker went out of his way to abuse certain senators whom he did not like, especially Senator Butler of South Carolina, who was then absent from the city, and who had made no special personal attack on Sumner.\nCharles Sumner, with all his learning, was a narrow-minded man. He was opinionated, egotistical, and incapable of giving credit to another for an honest difference of opinion. But he was sincerely honest and courageous.\u00b9 His espousal of the cause of the slave when that cause was very unpopular rose from the innermost depths of his soul. His furious attack on Butler was occasioned by the indignation expressed by the latter at the audacity of the Topeka convention in applying for statehood. But Sumner suffered severely for his extravagance. Two days after making this speech, as he sat at his desk writing, after the Senate had adjourned, he was assaulted with a cane by Preston Brooks, a member of the House and a relative of Senator Butler. Brooks rained blows on Sumner's head with great ferocity. Sumner sat so near his desk that he had no chance to defend himself; but at length he rose, wrenching the desk from its fastenings. Brooks then grappled with him and continued his blows until Sumner fell bleeding and unconscious to the floor.\nSo great were the injuries of the Massachusetts senator that he did not fully recover for four years; and indeed, never after this assault was he the powerful, robust athlete that he had been before. No incident in many years revealed more vividly the vast gulf between the North and the South than did the different manner of their receiving the news of this assault on Sumner\u00b2 Throughout the North the deed was denounced as a cowardly outrage, unworthy of any but a bully and a thug. At the South, where Sumner was hated above all men, the verdict was that he received only the punishment he deserved. Brooks was hailed as a champion and a hero, and was presented with many canes. He resigned his seat in the House because of a majority vote--not the necessary two thirds--for his expulsion; but he was immediately re\u00eblected by his district.\u00b3\nMeantime matters were growing worse on the plains of Kansas. On the day that intervened between the closing of Sumner's speech and the assault by Brooks the town of Lawrence was sacked by a mob. The House of Representatives sent a committee of three to Kansas to investigate matters and report. This committee, composed of William A. Howard of Michigan, John Sherman of Ohio, and Mordecai Oliver of Missouri, after examining several hundred witnesses, reported in July. Howard and Sherman reported favorably to the free-state party, but agreed that the election of Reeder to Congress, as that of Whitfield, was illegal. Oliver made a minority report favoring the southern view.\nWith the attack on Lawrence the Civil War in Kansas may be said to have begun. Soon after this occurred the massacre of Pottawatomie, the leader of which was John Brown. Brown had come from the East to join his sons, who had been among the early settlers of Kansas. He was an ascetic and a fanatic. He had come to Kansas to make it a free state at any hazard. He regarded slavery with a mortal hatred, and while his courage was unlimited and his intentions upright, his soul was too utterly narrow to see a thing in its true light. He believed that the only way to free the slaves was to kill the slaveholders. \"Without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins,\" said John Brown.\nA few free-state men, one of whom was a neighbor of Brown, had been killed by the opposite party, and Brown determined that an equal number of them should suffer death to expiate the crime. He organized a night raid--his sons and a few others--and started on his bloody errand. They called at one farmhouse after another and slew the men in cold blood. He did not inquire if they were guilty of not guilty; enough if they belonged to the opposite party. One man was dragged from the presence of a sick wife. Her pleadings that he be spared were not heeded. He was murdered in cold blood in the road before his house. Before the end of that bloody night raid Brown's party had put six or seven men to death--for no crime except that they belonged to the opposite party and had made threats--an offense of which Brown's party were equally guilty. When the news of this ghastly work was flashed over the country, the people in general refused to believe it; and to the credit of the free-state people in Kansas, they repudiated it as wholly unwarranted.\n\u00b9While he was uttering this speech, in which he attacked Senator Douglas also without mercy, the latter said to a friend: \"Do you hear that man? He may be a fool, but I tell you that he has pluck.\" Poore's \"Reminiscences,\" Vol. I, p. 461.\n\u00b2Rhodes, Vol. II, p. 143\n\u00b3Brooks died the following January, and Butler in May of the same year.","id":"<urn:uuid:7cccc48a-8bff-43dd-aedc-ca7bda58238f>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.usgennet.org\/usa\/ks\/state\/history\/history3.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9916058183,"token_count":1174,"score":3.265625,"int_score":3}

The localized information will be made available in the museum located in the Palisades of Washington DC.\nMore interest in our prehistory will hopefully allow the PMOP to organize a volunteer network that can react rapidly to events exposing our prehistory - like road works, building excavations, and erosion.\nThe bulk of prehistoric data remains locked up in government agencies and academic institutions. Many in the archaeological profession believe that releasing this information will encourage people to collect artifacts on federal lands. However well-intentioned, this mindset continues to exact a toll on the prehistoric record. Ignorance of history will guarantee the obliteration of the archeological record as more development continues with little regard to the people who onced lived here.\nBy providing the public access to the archaeological record, PMOP will boost awareness of our area's human history. In the end, both professionals and public will benefit from the increase of knowledge.\nBecause our region\u2019s prehistory spans at least 12,000 years, waves of indigenous cultures have come and gone dispersing evidence over broad geographic areas. The ravages of time have thinned much of that evidence. By recovering more evidence over a broader area, and making that information public, the PMOP hopes to raise awareness and understanding of those who lived here for thousands of years.\nIn terms of human evolution, the formative years of our species existed in lithic cultures. By greatly expanding the knowledge base of those cultures, the Palisades Museum of Prehistory hopes to shed light on our human nature.","id":"<urn:uuid:fc26fc57-daaf-45a2-aea5-5569a01d20a7>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.pmop.org\/mission.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9118217826,"token_count":436,"score":2.828125,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Municipal incorporation occurs when such municipalities become self-governing entities under the laws of the state or province in which they are located. Often, this event is marked by the award or declaration of a municipal charter.\nWith the notable exception of the City of London Corporation, the term has fallen out of favour in the United Kingdom, but the concept remains central to local government in the United Kingdom, as well as former British colonies such as India and Canada.\nMunicipal charters \nA city charter or town charter (generically, municipal charter) is a legal document establishing a municipality such as a city or town. The concept developed in Europe during the middle ages and is considered to be a municipal version of a constitution.\nTraditionally the granting of a charter gave a settlement and its inhabitants the right to town privileges under the feudal system. Townspeople who lived in chartered towns were burghers, as opposed to serfs who lived in villages. Towns were often \"free\", in the sense that they were directly protected by the king or emperor, and were not part of a feudal fief.\nToday the process for granting charters is determined by the type of government of the state in question. In monarchies, charters are still often a royal charter given by the Crown or the state authorities acting on behalf of the Crown. In federations, the granting of charters may be within the jurisdiction of the lower level of government such as a state or province.\nBy country \nIn Brazil, municipal corporations are called munic\u00edpios and are created by means of local legislation at state level, or after passing a referendum vote of the affected population. All municipal corporations must also abide by an Organic Municipal Law which is passed and amended (when needed) at municipal level.\nIn Canada charters are granted by provincial authorities.\nIn Germany, municipal corporations existed since antiquity and through medieval times, until they became out of favour during the absolutism. In order to strengthen the public spirit the city law of Prussia dated 19 November 1808 picked up this concept. It is the basis of today's municipal law.\nIn India a Municipal Corporation is a local government body that administers a city of population 10,00,000 or more. Under the panchayati raj system, it interacts directly with the state government, though it is administratively part of the district it is located in. The largest Municipal Corporations in India currently are Mumbai, followed by Delhi, Kolkata, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Surat and Pune. The Corporation of Chennai is the oldest Municipal Corporation in the world outside UK.\nThe Municipal Corporation consists of members elected from the wards of the city. The Mayor and Deputy Mayor are elected by the public. A Municipal Commissioner, who is from the Indian Administrative Service is appointed to head the administrative staff of the Municipal Corporation, implement the decisions of the Corporation and prepare its annual budget.\nThe Municipal Corporation is responsible for roads, public transportation, water supply, records of births and deaths (delegated from central government Births and Deaths Registration Act), sanitation that includes waste management, sewage, drainage and flood control, public safety services like fire and ambulance services, gardens and maintenance of buildings. The sources of income of the Corporation are property tax, entertainment tax, octroi (now abolished from many cities) and usage fees for utilities.\nRepublic of Ireland \nIn Ireland, municipal corporations existed in boroughs since medieval times. The Corporation of Dublin, officially styled the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses of the City of Dublin had existed since the 13th century. Corporations were established under the royal charter establishing the city or borough. The Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840 abolished all but ten of the boroughs and their corporations. The Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 created two different types of borough, county boroughs had essentially equal status to counties - these comprised Dublin, Cork, Limerick, and Waterford (as well as Belfast and Derry, which are now in Northern Ireland). The other boroughs were non-county boroughs.\nThe Local Government Act 2001 abolished the title of municipal corporation. Corporations of county boroughs (renamed cities) were renamed City Councils. Non county boroughs were abolished, but those towns which were previously non-county boroughs were allowed to use the title of Borough Council. Royal charters remain in force for ceremonial and civic purposes only.\nSouth Africa \nFrom the beginning of American colonial rule, Philippines cities were formally established through laws enacted by the various national legislatures in the country. The Philippine Commission gave the city of Manila its charter in 1901, while the city of Baguio was established by the Philippine Assembly which was composed by elected members instead of appointed ones. During the Commonwealth era, the National Assembly established an additional ten cities. Since achieving independence from the United States in 1946 the Philippine Congress has established 124 more cities (as of September 2007), the majority of which required the holding of a plebiscite within the proposed city's jurisdiction to ratify the city's charter.\nUnited Kingdom \nUnited States \nIn the United States, such municipal corporations are established by charters that are granted either directly by a state legislature by means of local legislation, or indirectly under a general municipal corporation law, usually after the proposed charter has passed a referendum vote of the affected population.","id":"<urn:uuid:ff2d2b6b-aa78-4bda-ba69-e90f18d28bfb>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/pediaview.com\/openpedia\/Municipal_corporation","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9693114161,"token_count":1116,"score":4.09375,"int_score":4}
{"text":"Do you ever feel like no matter what you do to get healthier or fit that you don\u2019t seem to succeed? Have you tried every diet out there, only to find the restrictions too difficult to manage? Have you attempted in earnest to maintain a fitness program only to find that, despite your best efforts, doing a consistent routine is too difficult to manage?\nWith all these starts and stops over years and decades, you may think: What\u2019s the point of trying? Or maybe you\u2019ve given up and resolved to just accept poor health as part of your life. Well, the inability to \u201cstick with it\u201d has many facets, some of which you may not be able to control. In fact, research shows that the self-control needed to succeed in many of these cases may be a limited resource.\nIn 2006, Michael Inzlicht and colleagues at the University of Toronto Scarborough studied what happens in the brain when humans try to abstain from something they want. That is, when we try to use willpower to refrain from acting on our urges to do something specific.\nFailure to control one\u2019s behavior is found in all aspects of life. It includes acting out, saying mean things, stealing and drug abuse. It also encompasses not doing things that are good for you like walking, eating healthy and getting plenty of rest.\nInzlicht set up a study, published in the journal Psychological Science, which tested participants\u2019 self-control over time. Participants were first asked to do something to deplete their \u201cstore\u201d of willpower or behavioral control and then see how much they had left for another, unrelated task.\nFirst, participants watched an emotionally upsetting movie and were asked to suppress their emotions and try not to cry during especially difficult scenes. Following this, participants completed what is called a Stroop task. Stroop is a psychological test that measures the reaction time needed to name colors that are printed in a color not associated with the color word. In other words, saying \u201cgreen\u201d when the word \u201cgreen\u201d was printed in the color red. This task may seem simple. While this seems simple, if you try it you will see how much self-control it takes not to blurt out the printed color and to have to suppress that urge and replace it with a correct response.\nDuring both the watching of the film and the Stroop task, participants\u2019 brain activity was measured by an EEG (electroencephalography) device. This records the electrical activity on the scalp to measure voltage changes within the brain\u2019s neurons.\nWhat the researchers discovered was intriguing. When participants had to restrain themselves and exert quite a bit of self-control (when not expressing emotions or when trying to say the names of colors), there was an increase of brain activity in the part of the brain\u2019s frontal lobe known as the anterior cingulate cortex. This is the region of the brain involved in autonomic functions, like regulating blood pressure and heart rate, as well as rational cognitive functions, such as reward anticipation, decision-making and emotion.\nThe interesting finding in this study is that there was less frontal lobe activity with the Stroop task after watching the gut-wrenching film. In other words, when a fair amount of self-control was previously used on one task, the next time it was needed there was less available for use. These findings suggest that people may not have as much willpower or control over their behavior as time progresses and demands are placed on them to exert such control.\nIt is pretty discouraging to think that the human brain is capable only of providing a strong degree of self-control during a given time period. That might seem to leave most of us with little hope for change. Think about it: If we use self-control to not eat a sticky bun with breakfast and force ourselves to take that morning jog, then we will have less available control over our behavior when it comes to making lunch and dinner choices, or passing on the second round of drinks, or going to the gym or to yoga class. Is it any wonder why so many fail at diets and exercise routines time and time again?\nWell, this needn\u2019t be the case and more information has recently been published on this issue. A study again headed by Inzlicht, this time with colleague Brandon Schmeichel of Texas A&M University, appeared in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science. In this further research, Inzlicht now finds that the \u201climited resource\u201d model of self-control is too narrow and does not explain the exceptions, the times when self-control is in place and one is able to maintain the level necessary to effect positive change by making repeated good choices. It is not a \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d situation as previously thought, but more closely tied to motivation, this study shows.\nWhile previous research apparently pointed to a decrease in the amount of willpower available with each passing task requiring some form of self-control, this conclusion may be flawed because of the generic activity used in the studies. In other words, researchers had set up lab situations wherein subjects had no strong motivation influencing their behavior.\nThe more recent study indicates that mood, personal beliefs, positive reinforcement and motivation play a big role in exerting willpower. Inzlicht and Schmeichel propose that \u201cengaging in self-control by definition, is hard work; it involved deliberation, attention, and vigilance.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not the case that resisting an extra piece of bacon at breakfast uses up our daily store of willpower, making self-control more difficult later in the day when needed. Rather, it seems that the motivation to exert our willpower later in the day seems less motivating. At that later time, we tend to want to reward ourselves for hard work done.\nIn the end, as with everything else affecting health and well-being, you can divide your circumstances into things you can do to help reach your goals and things beyond your control.\nIn the case of self-control, you need long-term behavior modification for success. My experience has shown that trying to restrict too many things is what leads to failure. For example, trying to set new exercise goals, diet routines and sleep patterns all at the same time creates an overwhelming struggle.\nInstead, making one change for a few weeks before adding another seems to allow the brain and behaviors to reshape and recondition to the new activity. Repetition over time turns a self-controlled behavior into a habit that then keeps taking place on autopilot. Once the first piece of the healthy behavior is under new control, add the second piece, and so on. In this way, you don\u2019t run out of your willpower stores, you don\u2019t deplete your motivation and you learn new healthier behaviors along the way. Without behavior modification, all programs for change will fail.\nThink about times you have tried to make positive changes in your life and have fallen short or failed. Then think about how many things you were trying to control for at that time. Also consider the moments when you were on the path to success but allowed yourself an indulgence for work well done, and that indulgence set you back in your efforts.\nIf you analyze in light of the research on self-control, you can find the way forward. It reminds me of the old maxim: \u201cInch by inch, life is a cinch; yard by yard, it\u2019s very hard.\u201d Which leads to another appropriate maxim: \u201cThe journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step.\u201d\nSlow down your efforts to be healthier into manageable steps, and over time new behaviors will arise that make self-control easier overall and wellness restoration an achievable goal.","id":"<urn:uuid:3ece9155-b933-4d67-b97e-036f5f903fb3>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/easyhealthoptions.com\/alternative-medicine\/nutrition\/the-key-to-changing-your-life\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9652346969,"token_count":1607,"score":2.921875,"int_score":3}

In the UK, about one third of the coastline is protected by such beaches .\nIn coastal defence schemes, considerable use is made of coarse-grained (gravel) sediment to replenish eroding beaches, often in conjunction with structures such as rock or wooden groynes or offshore breakwaters. This is because such beaches are known to be an efficient form of natural coastal defence . Two examples from the UK are those at Sidmouth, Devon and Elmer, West Sussex.\n|Sidmouth coastal defence scheme||Elmer coastal defence scheme |\nPicture courtesy of the Arun District Council\nResearch into the particular characteristics of gravel beaches and their engineering analysis is relatively new, with much of the progress being made recently. In the 1990\u2019s small scale experimental measurements and early field studies lead to the subsequent development of parametric models for profile prediction, longshore transport and the stability of barrier beaches. Since 2002, two major large scale experimental studies and some new comprehensive field studies have been undertaken. Since that time, good progress has also been made in process based numerical modelling systems for long and cross shore transport.\nThe emphasis of the article is to present in a clear and concise manner the most relevant concepts, basic understanding and insights into the behaviour of gravel beaches, to provide a summary of the available engineering analysis techniques and modelling approaches and to provide guidance to further reading and a list of the most relevant references to work carried out since 1990.\n|Sediment supply from soft cliffs |\n\u00a9 A. J. Chadwick\nThe current world\u2019s coastlines were formed as a result of the last ice age, which ended about 10,000 years ago (see the beach management manual ). At that time large ice sheets covered more of the world\u2019s land masses than they do at present. As they melted there was a rapid rise of sea level (about 120m between 20,000 and 6000 years ago). Vast quantities of sediment were carried by rivers to the sea during this period, eventually forming the pre-cursor to our present coastlines as the rate of sea level rise rapidly reduced about 6000 years ago. Much of our beaches today are composed of the remnants of these sediments, composed predominantly of sand and gravel. These sources of beach material have subsequently been supplemented by coastal erosion of soft cliffs and the reduced but continuing supply of sediments from rivers. Material has also been derived from offshore banks left behind by relatively rapid rises of sea level after cold episodes in the earth\u2019s climate.\nSediment classification and properties\n|all pictures: \u00a9 A. J. Chadwick|\nTraditionally sand and gravel sizes have been classified according to the Wentworth scale. This defines sand as being of diameter between 0.0625mm to 2mm. Material sizes larger than this are classified as gravel, subdivided into granular (2mm to 4 mm), pebble (4mm to 64 mm), cobble (64mm to 256 mm) and boulder (>256 mm). Rounded gravel, typical of a significant number of UK beaches, is referred to as shingle.\nThere are several physical properties of sand and gravel beaches which are important in the study of coastal sediment transport. The first is the sediment density (\u03c1s), typically 2650 kg\/m\u00b3 for quartz. The rest are required in recognition of the fact that a beach comprises a mixture of the beach material, interspersed with voids which may be filled with air or water. Thus the bulk density (\u03c1b) is defined as the in situ mass of the mixture\/volume of the mixture, the porosity (ps) as the volume of air or water\/volume of the mixture, typically between 0.25 to 0.4 for a gravel beach, the voids ratio (e) as the volume of air or water\/volume of the grains, typically between 0.33 to 0.66 for a gravel beach, and finally the angle of repose (\u03a6), which is the limiting slope angle at which the grains begin to roll, typically about 35\u00b0 in air. In water this reduces to about 30\u00b0.\nThe material sizes on any particular beach will normally comprise a range of grain sizes, thus it is standard practice to measure the grain size distribution by a sieve analysis from which the percentage by weight of material passing through a range of sieve sizes is plotted against particle size. The median size is denoted by D50, representing the diameter for which 50% of the grains by mass are finer. The spread of sizes is often indicated by the values of D84 and D16 and their ratio is used to measure the degree of sorting. A well sorted sample is one in which there is a small range of sizes (D85\/D16<2), whereas a well mixed sample has a large range of sizes (D85\/D16>16).\nBeaches types may be categorised according to the mixture of sands and gravels present, which has a significant influence on the beach slope and the more general morphological response of the beach to wave action. Four categories are defined as pure gravel (G), mixed sand and gravel (MSG), composite sand and gravel (CSG) and pure sand (S).\n|\u00a9 A. J. Chadwick|| Picture courtesy of\nHalcrow Consulting Engineers\n|\u00a9 A. J. Chadwick||\u00a9 A. J. Chadwick|\nThe characteristics of a gravel beach are very different from those of a sand beach. Most notably, gravel can support a steep gradient typically of the order of 1 in 8 with a tendency to form a near vertical berm towards the high water mark and a step at the wave break point. Swell wave conditions promote onshore accretion in the swash zone, with storm conditions promoting rapid offshore erosion. Despite the large grain size, the sediment is highly mobile. Changes in the vertical profile of the order of 0.5m are commonly found over just one tidal cycle for moderate to large waves .\n|all pictures: \u00a9 A. J. Chadwick|\n|all pictures: \u00a9 A. J. Chadwick|\nOn macro-tidal beaches, the active swash zone continuously re-works the beach face as the tide rises and falls. At low tide, it is common to observe a berm at the high water mark of the beach below which is a beach face of uniform slope, which ends in the step feature at the low water mark.\nCusp formation on gravel beaches is another distinctive feature. They can form rapidly when the wave approach is near normal, but are also washed out rapidly when the wave approach changes to an oblique angle. In the literature, two dominant models of cusp formation are recognised, namely edge wave forced and swash circulation\/self organisation modes. However, cusp formation on gravel beaches has not been discussed very much in the literature .\n|\u00a9 A. J. Chadwick|\nThe steep beach gradient allows waves to progress much closer inshore before breaking, often resulting in a single plunging breaker. Consequently, there is minimal generation of infra-gravity waves. Even during storms, a wide surf zone is rare. An important consequence of this is that the swash zone can be of similar width to the surf zone and hence the sediment transport within the swash zone is of considerably more significance than on sand beaches. A second effect of the steep beach gradient is that refraction processes are also confined to a narrower zone than is experienced on a sand beach, with the result that refraction is often observed to be incomplete and the waves arrive at the beach face with some considerable angle, resulting in significant longshore transport. Gravel beaches are also much more reflective than sand beaches, with reflection coefficients of up to about 0.2.\nAnother distinguishing characteristic is the high permeability of gravel which, compared to a sand beach, increases the potential for infiltration during the swash uprush and exfiltration during the swash downrush. This induces a downward, stabilising force on sediment movement during the uprush and a lift force during backwash. Conversely, there is a thinning of the boundary layer during uprush, leading to increased shear stress on the bed and a thickening during backwash, leading to deceased shear stress on the bed. This latter effect is thought to predominate. On a gravel beach the backwash volume can also be considerably reduced, lowering the backwash velocities (see Elfrink and Baldock (2002)  for a detailed review). It is these processes that lead to the formation of the high water mark berm.\n|Picture courtesy A. Pedrozo-Acuna|\nBarrier beaches are a common geomorphological feature across the world, many of which are composed of gravel. Their essential features comprise a narrow, elongated ridge of sand or gravel existing slightly above the high tide level. The ridge generally extends parallel to the shore, but is separated from it by a wetland, lagoon or a tidal flat. Barrier beaches act as natural means of coast protection. In addition, wetlands and lagoons formed behind barrier beaches provide shelter for many coastal habitats and are therefore of considerable environmental significance. One explanation of their formation is that they have been formed by landward migration of submerged sand\/shingle banks with rising sea levels since the last ice age.\nBarrier beaches are constantly evolving in response to short and long term processes. Short term changes in barrier beaches are related to local wave and current climate, tidal variations, frequency and magnitude of storm events, barrier geometry and type of beach sediment and permeability. Over longer terms, the primary factors for change and modification of barrier beaches are sea level rise, longshore sediment transport and changes in sediment sources and\/or sinks according to Orford et al. (1995) .\nA barrier beach can respond to these factors by landward or seaward migration, reshaping and re-alignment and crest breakdown or build-up . The episodic processes of over-washing, over-topping and associated breaching are the primary phenomena behind long term evolution.\nUnderstanding the processes of sediment transport on gravel beaches is important for beach management which requires some quantification of shoreline evolution. The vast majority of coastal engineering projects still rely on one-line models since, as yet, 3D morphodynamic models are restricted to short- and medium-term predictions and none have been validated against coarse-grained field data. Most one-line models make use of empirical total longshore transport equations. Hence, the formulation of a reliable estimate of longshore sediment transport rate remains of considerable practical importance in coastal engineering applications such as feasibility studies of port extensions, derivation of sediment budgets for coastal areas and the appraisal of long term beach stability.\nTo some extent, the mechanisms associated with the longshore transport of gravel may be differentiated from that of sand. Generally, for a sand seabed the oscillatory force due to the passage of a (breaking) wave will tend to stir the sediment into motion. The bed shear due to the longshore current can then transport the sand. On gravel beaches the sediment normally moves as bedload and is largely confined to the swash zone. As the flow in the uprush is perpendicular to the wave crest and in the backwash is perpendicular to the beach contours, the gravel describes a 'sawtooth', or zig-zag, path along the beach.\nQuantitative estimation of sediment transport rates is extremely difficult on a gravel beach. Direct measurement of longshore transport has been attempted using a variety of techniques, such as deposition of a tracer material (radioactive, dyed or artificial sediment) or installation of traps (see Van Wellan et al. (2000)  for a review).\n|all pictures: \u00a9 A. J. Chadwick|\nChanges in beach volumes may be calculated from data derived from ground or aerial surveys. If surveys are carried out over several years a trend for accretion or depletion may be discernible. This is not necessarily a direct measure of the longshore transport rate along the coast. Rather it is an indication of any imbalances in the supply of sediment from one point to another. However, where marine structures are constructed which cut of the supply from further up the coast, comparisons of beach volumes before and after construction can give some indication of the longshore transport rates.\n|all pictures: \u00a9 A. J. Chadwick|\nThe most widely used formula for calculating longshore transport is the CERC equation (US Army Corps of Engineers, 1984). The equation was derived from sand beaches and has been developed over a number of years. The formula is intended to include both bedload and suspended load and is usually given in the form of:\nis the immersed weight sediment transport rate\nis the longshore component of wave power\nwhere E is wave energy, is group wave speed, \u03b8 is wave approach angle, subscript b refers to wave break point\nand where K is a dimensionless empirically derived coefficient. The volumetric transport rate, , is related to by: where\nwhere \u03c1s is sediment density, \u03c1 is sea water density, e is voids ratio.\nThere is no direct inclusion of the influence of grain size in the CERC equation, other than via the coefficient, K. It should be noted that for random waves, the choice of wave height used in the CERC equation (significant wave height, Hs or root mean square wave height, Hrms) must be correlated with the K value. Much confusion can arise, as some authors have used Hs and others Hrms without explicitly stating which one. For Rayleigh distributed waves, the K value using Hrms is twice that using Hs. A suggested value for K using Hrms is 0.77 for sand sized sediments. For gravel beaches, Chadwick\u2019s (1989) data suggested a K value of 7% of that for sand (K=0.053). This was later found to work well at another beach site, Slapton Sands, Devon,UK (see Alegria-Arzaburu & Masselink (2010) ).\nChadwick (1991)  also developed a numerical model to predict longshore transport on gravel beaches. The hydrodynamic module uses the non-linear shallow water wave equations, which predict the instantaneous water levels and velocities throughout the surf and swash zones. These are combined with a sediment transport module based on Bagnold's stream power concept. Instantaneous transport rates across the surf and swash zones are subsequently summed in space and time to determine the total longshore transport rate. Thus, this model specifically includes a sediment threshold term and transport in the swash zone, both of which are of importance on shingle beaches. The model required calibration of only the friction coefficient, which was determined from field data. Subsequently, an algebraic formula (the Chadwick-Van Wellen formula) was derived from the numerical model results given by:\nThis equation was specifically designed for application to gravel beaches but has only been calibrated to the data from one field site. For further details of this and other longshore transport equations, applicable to gravel beaches, see Van Wellen et al (2000) .\nLarge scale experimental studies\n|\u00a9 A. J. Chadwick|\nMore recent work on coarse grained beaches was undertaken by the EU project \u201cLarge Scale Modelling of Coarse Grained Beaches\u201d which was undertaken between March-May 2002. The experiment was conducted at full scale, thus avoiding the sediment scaling issues inherent in small scale models. The measurements included not only the wave field and resultant equilibrium profile development, but also detailed measurements of pore water pressures under the swash face. The experimental results of this work may be found in L\u00f3pez de San Rom\u00e1n-Blanco et al (2006) . This experiment was used to develop the cross shore profile model of Pedrozo et al (2006) , described in more detail in this article.\nSubsequently another large scale experimental study of gravel barrier beaches was undertaken in BARDEX (Barrier Dynamics Experiment) in the Delta wave flume, the Netherlands, during June and July 2008. One unique aspect of this work was the inclusion of the effects of a back barrier lagoon in conjunction with a varying tidal level. A special edition of Coastal Engineering has been devoted to papers resulting from this work (see Turner and Masselink (2012)) . These include details of the observations, the effect of the lagoon water level on the beach profile, new measurements of and prediction techniques for wave friction factors, new predictive techniques for assessing barrier overwashing and overtopping and an assessment of the XBeach model used to predict beach profile evolution and the morphological effect of washover.\nParametric models for equilibrium profiles\nThe prediction of the expected profile for a gravel beach is very different from the concepts used for equilibrium profiles on a sand beach. The problem was first comprehensively addressed by van der Meer (1988)  and Powell (1990) , based on extensive scaled laboratory flume tests (small scale with anthracite in Powell\u2019s case and large and small scale with gravel in van der Meer\u2019s case). Powell\u2019s work resulted in the development of a parametric profile model, which described the profile as a set of three curves: from the crest to the still water level, from the still water level to a transition point and from the transition point to the base of the profile. This was found to work well using the data from the GWK experiment ).\nParametric models for barrier stability\nBradbury (2000)  carried out a series of 3-D mobile bed laboratory tests on barrier crest response to hydrodynamic conditions and initial barrier geometry. Based on the model investigations, several categories of barrier response to hydrodynamic conditions were identified and underlying characteristics were qualitatively defined. These included crest raised by overtopping, crest lowered due to undermining of crest but with no overtopping, crest raised by over-washing with roll-back, crest lowered by over-washing with roll-back and finally, no change to the crest elevation with profile contained to seaward of the barrier crest.\nHe developed an expression for an over-washing threshold of barrier crests, based on regression analysis. It is a function of wave steepness (Hs\/Lm), barrier free board (Rc) and barrier cross-sectional area Ba (above the still water line), given by:\nThe expression was validated against field data gathered at Hurst Spit, UK and found to be consistent with the field data. In addition, a conceptual model for barrier over-washing was formulated. According to his model, the beach will initially attempt to reach a dynamic equilibrium; if the critical barrier inertia is exceeded then the crest will be lowered by over-washing.\nModelling cross shore profile development\n|Picture courtesy of A. Pedrozo-Acuna|\nThe first of several recent deterministic process based models for predicting the profile response of coarse grained beaches was developed by Lawrence, Chadwick and Fleming (2001) . It was shown that Boussinesq equations coupled with a bed load sediment transport formulation were a useful approach for process-based modelling of gravel beach profile evolution. This model was subsequently extended to model the sediment transport of grain size fractions and thus to predict sediment sorting across the beach face . However, it was found that this numerical model scheme was not stable on steep beaches.\nSubsequently, using a newer Boussinesq model, Pedrozo et al (2006)  demonstrated that the two principle sediment parameters of friction (f) and sediment transport efficiency (C) were controlling the shape of the gravel beach profile. With f and C as constant values, accurate prediction of the profile evolution was not possible. The use of bigger friction factors in the uprush slightly improved the prediction. When larger values of the sediment transport efficiency (C -value) were used in the uprush compared to the backwash, better predictions of the beach profile resulted. The physical processes which dictate the differences between the predicted and measured profiles were hypothesised as being related to infiltration effects on the flow above the beach face and more accelerated flow in the uprush. Further developments coupling the effects of infiltration\/exfiltration with sediment movement were still required at that time. The more recent results reported by Jamal et al (2010)  and Williams et al (2012)  indicate that including this process leads to significant improvements in prediction. Pedrozo et al (2010)  have also highlighted the importance of the impulsive pressures induced by plunging breakers on gravel beach sediment transport.\nSuggestions for further research\nFor all budding researchers in coastal research, the further study of gravel and mixed beaches offers much opportunity to enhance our knowledge. Longshore transport prediction is still imprecise and cross shore processes very complex and not completely understood. Current parametric design methods leave much to be desired. Further field and large scale experimental studies remain a primary tool for advancing our understanding of long and cross shore processes. These will need to stand on the heads of the previously mentioned studies. Numerical modelling tools can still benefit greatly from improved process representation, including infiltration\/exfiltration, interactions with groundwater flows, impulsive pressure forces, the incorporation of grain size fractions and the prediction of sediment sorting across the beach face.\nExample barrier beaches\nChesil Beach, Dorset UK, is a world famous gravel barrier beach. It is approximately 28 kilometres long and, on average, 160 metres wide. The height of the beach is typically 11 metres above mean sea level. The beach stabilised close to its present position around 5000 years ago.\nA rent research paper concerning the internal structure of Chesil beach (Bennett et al (2009))  also contains a good summary of the extensive historical literature on this beach. There is an informative web site at www.chesilbeach.org.\nA comprehensive assessment of the historical development and contemporary processes affecting a significant gravel barrier beach system in the UK (Slapton Sands, South Devon UK) may be found in Chadwick et al (2005)  and a short summary of these studies is presented elsewhere in the coastal wiki (Slapton barrier beach case study, UK).\nThe paper includes assessment of the effects of sea level rise on barrier migration and its susceptibility to over-washing and overtopping, inter alia. It was found that the processes at work on the Slapton shoreline included:\n|\u00a9 A. J. Chadwick|\n- Short-term changes in beach profile due to storms, acting over a period of several days. These storms cause cut-back of the seaward edge of the shingle crest, or changes in crest elevation\n- Overtopping, in which wave action throws water and sediment onto the crest.\n- Overflowing, or overwashing, where extremely high water levels coincident with wave action cause water to flow over the crest of the ridge. This can cause significant changes to the crest and backslope of the ridge.\n- Medium-term changes in beach width and profile due to longshore transport, occurring over a period of months or several years.\n- Long-term landward retreat; the barrier beach responds to sea level rise by \u201croll-over\u201d and by increasing its crest height. This process involves overwashing, transferring sediment from the shore-face to the back barrier area. This is an episodic rather than a continuous process.\n- Planform change; as the barrier beach is pinned by hard rock cliffs at either end (Strete and Torcross), landward retreat results in a gradual increase in both curvature and length.\nIn a later comprehensive field study of this site, Alegria-Arzuburu and Masselink (2010)  used an ARGUS video system to monitor short and medium term changes. This study confirmed many of the conclusions reached in the Chadwick study and demonstrated the importance of storm sequencing to both long and cross shore processes which affect beach erosion and accretion.\nAn up to date and comprehensive review of gravel beaches and barriers may be found in Anthony (2008) . Gravel beach dynamics are reviewed by Buscombe and Masselink (2006) . Stripling et al (2008)  present a good review of barrier beaches and their management.\nFinally, the management manual (2010)  provides information on state-of-art methods, guidance on beach monitoring and maintenance, evaluation of the state and performance of a beach, design, procurement, execution and the after-care of beach improvement schemes.

{"text":"Excerpts for Thames : The Biography\nThe River as Fact\nIt has a length of 215 miles, and is navigable for 191 miles. It is the longest river in England but not in Britain, where the Severn is longer by approximately 5 miles. Nevertheless it must be the shortest river in the world to acquire such a famous history. The Amazon and the Mississippi cover almost 4,000 miles, and the Yangtze almost 3,500 miles; but none of them has arrested the attention of the world in the manner of the Thames.\nIt runs along the borders of nine English counties, thus reaffirming its identity as a boundary and as a defence. It divides Wiltshire from Gloucestershire, and Oxfordshire from Berkshire; as it pursues its way it divides Surrey from Middlesex (or Greater London as it is inelegantly known) and Kent from Essex. It is also a border of Buckinghamshire. It guarded these once tribal lands in the distant past, and will preserve them into the imaginable future.\nThere are 134 bridges along the length of the Thames, and forty-four locks above Teddington. There are approximately twenty major tributaries still flowing into the main river, while others such as the Fleet have now disappeared under the ground. Its \"basin,\" the area from which it derives its water from rain and other natural forces, covers an area of some 5,264 square miles. And then there are the springs, many of them in the woods or close to the streams beside the Thames. There is one in the wood below Sinodun Hills in Oxfordshire, for example, which has been described as an \"everlasting spring\" always fresh and always renewed.\nThe average flow of the river at Teddington, chosen because it marks the place where the tidal and non-tidal waters touch, has been calculated at 1,145 millions of gallons (5,205 millions of litres) each day or approximately 2,000 cubic feet (56.6 cubic metres) per second. The current moves at a velocity between 1\u00da2 and 23\u00da4 miles per hour. The main thrust of the river flow is known to hydrologists as the \"thalweg\"; it does not move in a straight and forward line but, mingling with the inner flow and the variegated flow of the surface and bottom waters, takes the form of a spiral or helix. More than 95 per cent of the river's energy is lost in turbulence and friction.\nThe direction of the flow of the Thames is therefore quixotic. It might be assumed that it would move eastwards, but it defies any simple prediction. It flows north-west above Henley and at Teddington, west above Abingdon, south from Cookham and north above Marlow and Kingston. This has to do with the variegated curves of the river. It does not meander like the Euphrates, where according to Herodotus the voyager came upon the same village three times on three separate days, but it is circuitous. It specialises in loops. It will take the riparian traveller two or three times as long to cover the same distance as a companion on the high road. So the Thames teaches you to take time, and to view the world from a different vantage.\nThe average \"fall\" or decline of the river from its beginning to its end is approximately 17 to 21 inches (432 to 533 mm) per mile. It follows gravity, and seeks out perpetually the simplest way to the sea. It falls some 600 feet (183 m) from source to sea, with a relatively precipitous decline of 300 feet (91.5 m) in the first 9 miles; it falls 100 (30.4 m) more in the next 11 miles, with a lower average for the rest of its course. Yet averages may not be so important. They mask the changeability and idiosyncrasy of the Thames. The mean width of the river is given as 1,000 feet (305 m), and a mean depth of 30 feet (9 m); but the width varies from 1 or 2 feet (0.3 to 0.6 m) at Trewsbury to 51\u00da2 miles at the Nore.\nThe tide, in the words of Tennyson, is that which \"moving seems asleep, too full for sound and foam.\" On its flood inward it can promise benefit or danger; on its ebb seaward it suggests separation or adventure. It is one general movement but it comprises a thousand different streams and eddies; there are opposing streams, and high water is not necessarily the same thing as high tide. The water will sometimes begin to fall before the tide is over. The average speed of the tide lies between 1 and 3 knots (1.15 and 3.45 miles per hour), but at times of very high flow it can reach 7 knots (8 miles per hour). At London Bridge the flood tide runs for almost six hours, while the ebb tide endures for six hours and thirty minutes. The tides are much higher now than at other times in the history of the Thames. There can now be a difference of some 24 feet (7.3 m) between high and low tides, although the average rise in the area of London Bridge is between 15 and 22 feet (4.5 and 6.7 m). In the period of the Roman occupation, it was a little over 3 feet (0.9 m). The high tide, in other words, has risen greatly over a period of two thousand years.\nThe reason is simple. The south-east of England is sinking slowly into the water at the rate of approximately 12 inches (305 mm) per century. In 4000 BC the land beside the Thames was 46 feet (14 m) higher than it is now, and in 3000 BC it was some 31 feet (9.4 m) higher. When this is combined with the water issuing from the dissolution of the polar ice-caps, the tides moving up the lower reaches of the Thames are increasing at a rate of 2 feet (0.6 m) per century. That is why the recently erected Thames Barrier will not provide protection enough, and another barrier is being proposed.\nThe tide of course changes in relation to the alignment of earth, moon and sun. Every two weeks the high \"spring\" tides reach their maximum two days after a full moon, while the low \"neap\" tides occur at the time of the half-moon. The highest tides occur at the times of equinox; this is the period of maximum danger for those who live and work by the river. The spring tides of late autumn and early spring are also hazardous. It is no wonder that the earliest people by the Thames venerated and propitiated the river.\nThe general riverscape of the Thames is varied without being in any sense spectacular, the paraphernalia of life ancient and modern clustering around its banks. It is in large part now a domesticated river, having been tamed and controlled by many generations. It is in that sense a piece of artifice, with some of its landscape deliberately planned to blend with the course of the water. It would be possible to write the history of the Thames as a history of a work of art.\nIt is a work still in slow progress. The Thames has taken the same course for ten thousand years, after it had been nudged southward by the glaciation of the last ice age. The British and Roman earthworks by the Sinodun Hills still border the river, as they did two thousand years before. Given the destructive power of the moving waters, this is a remarkable fact. Its level has varied over the millennia--there is a sudden and unexpected rise at the time of the Anglo-Saxon settlement, for example--and the discovery of submerged forests testifies to incidents of overwhelming flood. Its appearance has of course also altered, having only recently taken the form of a relatively deep and narrow channel, but its persistence and identity through time are an aspect of its power.\nYet of course every stretch has its own character and atmosphere, and every zone has its own history. Out of oppositions comes energy, out of contrasts beauty. There is the overwhelming difference of water within it, varying from the pure freshwater of the source through the brackish zone of estuarial water to the salty water in proximity to the sea. Given the eddies of the current, in fact, there is rather more salt by the Essex shore than by the Kentish shore. There are manifest differences between the riverine landscapes of Lechlade and of Battersea, of Henley and of Gravesend; the upriver calm is in marked contrast to the turbulence of the long stretches known as River of London and then London River. After New Bridge the river becomes wider and deeper, in anticipation of its change.\nThe rural landscape itself changes from flat to wooded in rapid succession, and there is a great alteration in the nature of the river from the cultivated fields of Dorchester to the thick woods of Cliveden. From Godstow the river becomes a place of recreation, breezy and jaunty with the skiffs and the punts, the sports in Port Meadow and the picnic parties on the banks by Binsey. But then by some change of light it becomes dark green, surrounded by vegetation like a jungle river; and then the traveller begins to see the dwellings of Oxford, and the river changes again. Oxford is a pivotal point. From there you can look upward and consider the quiet source; or you can look downstream and contemplate the coming immensity of London.\nIn the reaches before Lechlade the water makes its way through isolated pastures; at Wapping and Rotherhithe the dwellings seem to drop into it, as if overwhelmed by numbers. The elements of rusticity and urbanity are nourished equally by the Thames. That is why parts of the river induce calm and forgetfulness, and others provoke anxiety and despair. It is the river of dreams, but it is also the river of suicide. It has been called liquid history because within itself it dissolves and carries all epochs and generations. They ebb and flow like water.\nThe River as Metaphor\nThe river runs through the language, and we speak of its influence in every conceivable context. It is employed to characterise life and death, time and destiny; it is used as a metaphor for continuity and dissolution, for intimacy and transitoriness, for art and history, for poetry itself. In The Principles of Psychology (1890) William James first coined the phrase \"stream of consciousness\" in which \"every definite image of the mind is steeped . . . in the free water that flows around it.\" Thus \"it flows\" like the river itself. Yet the river is also a token of the unconscious, with its suggestion of depth and invisible life.\nThe river is a symbol of eternity, in its unending cycle of movement and change. It is one of the few such symbols that can readily be understood, or appreciated, and in the continuing stream the mind or soul can begin to contemplate its own possible immortality.\nIn the poetry of John Denham's \"Cooper's Hill\" (1642), the Thames is a metaphor for human life. How slight its beginning, how confident its continuing course, how ineluctable its destination within the great ocean:\nHasting to pay his tribute to the sea,\nLike mortal life to meet eternity.\nThe poetry of the Thames has always emphasised its affiliations with human purpose and with human realities. So the personality of the river changes in the course of its journey from the purity of its origins to the broad reaches of the commercial world. The river in its infancy is undefiled, innocent and clear. By the time it is closely pent in by the city, it has become dank and foul, defiled by greed and speculation. In this regress it is the paradigm of human life and of human history. Yet the river has one great advantage over its metaphoric companions. It returns to its source, and its corruption can be reversed. That is why baptism was once instinctively associated with the river. The Thames has been an emblem of redemption and of renewal, of the hope of escaping from time itself.\nWhen Wordsworth observed the river at low tide, with the vista of the \"mighty heart\" of London \"lying still,\" he used the imagery of human circulation. It is the image of the river as blood, pulsing through the veins and arteries of its terrain, without which the life of London would seize up. Sir Walter Raleigh, contemplating the Thames from the walk by his cell in the Tower, remarked that the \"blood which disperseth itself by the branches or veins through all the body, may be resembled to these waters which are carried by brooks and rivers overall the earth.\" He wrote his History of the World (1610) from his prison cell, and was deeply imbued with the current of the Thames as a model of human destiny. It has been used as the symbol for the unfolding of events in time, and carries the burden of past events upon its back. For Raleigh the freight of time grew ever more complex and wearisome as it proceeded from its source; human life had become darker and deeper, less pure and more susceptible to the tides of affairs. There was one difference Raleigh noticed in his history, when he declared that \"for this tide of man's life, after it once turneth and declineth, ever runneth with a perpetual ebb and falling stream, but never floweth again.\"\nThe Thames has also been understood as a mirror of morality. The bending rushes and the yielding willows afford lessons in humility and forbearance; the humble weeds along its banks have been praised for their lowliness and absence of ostentation. And who has ventured upon the river without learning the value of patience, of endurance, and of vigilance? John Denham makes the Thames the subject of native discourse in a further sense:\nThough deep, yet clear; though gentle, yet not dull;\nStrong without rage; without o'erflowing, full.\nThis suggests that the river represents an English measure, an aesthetic harmony to be sought or wished for, but in the same breath Denham seems to be adverting to some emblem of Englishness itself. The Thames is a metaphor for the country through which it runs. It is modest and moderate, calm and resourceful; it is powerful without being fierce. It is not flamboyantly impressive. It is large without being too vast. It eschews extremes. It weaves its own course without artificial diversions or interventions. It is useful for all manner of purposes. It is a practical river.\nWhen Robert Menzies, an erstwhile Australian prime minister, was taken to Runnymede he was moved to comment upon the \"secret springs\" of the \"slow English character.\" This identification of the land with the people, the characteristics of the earth and water with the temperament of their inhabitants, remains a poignant one. There is an inward and intimate association between the river and those who live beside it, even if that association cannot readily be understood.\nFrom the Hardcover edition.","id":"<urn:uuid:c8589dab-6a33-4d56-9c69-99faf059b9e4>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/sherloc.imcpl.org\/enhancedContent.pl?contentType=ExcerptDetail&isbn=9780385528474","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9624767303,"token_count":3140,"score":3.390625,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Brussels, 21 December 2005\nThe European Commission today proposed a new strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste. This long-term strategy aims to help Europe become a recycling society that seeks to avoid waste and uses waste as a resource. It will draw on the knowledge that the thematic strategy on resources, also adopted today, will generate. As a first step, the Commission proposes revising the 1975 Waste Framework Directive to set recycling standards and to include an obligation for Member States to develop national waste prevention programmes. This revision will also merge, streamline and clarify legislation, contributing to better regulation. The waste and resources strategies are two of the seven 'thematic' strategies required under the 6th Environment Action Programme (2002-2012).\nEnvironment Commissioner Stavros Dimas said: \u201cWaste volume has been disproportionately increasing outpacing even economic growth. Waste generation, disposal and recycling are of concern to all of us: individuals, companies and public authorities. Now is the time to modernise our approach and to promote more and better recycling. Our strategy does precisely that.\nMore waste than ever\nEU environment legislation has helped improve the way we dispose waste and recycle specific waste streams, such as municipal waste, packaging, cars and electric and electronic equipment. Waste management has moved a long way from being a dirty, polluting business. High standards exist for landfills and incinerators. Industry now seeks to make a profit from waste instead of dumping it.\nHowever, waste generation in the EU is estimated at more than 1.3 billion tonnes per year and is increasing at rates comparable to economic growth. For example, both GDP and municipal waste grew by 19% between 1995 and 2003. One consequence of this growth is that despite large increases in recycling, landfill - the environmentally most problematic way to get rid of waste - is only reducing slowly.\nWaste policy must contribute to improving the way we use resources\nWhat is needed now is to modernise and widen EU waste policy in the light of new knowledge. Companies and public authorities need to take a life-cycle approach that does not only look at pollution caused by waste. It must also take account of how waste policies can most efficiently reduce the negative environmental impacts associated with the use of resources through preventing, recycling and recovering wastes.\nTo move towards this objective EU waste law must create the right regulatory environment for recycling activities to develop.\nMeasures proposed by the strategy\nThe strategy comes as a package. It includes a legislative proposal to modernise the 1975 Waste Framework Directive.\nThe main elements of the proposed revision of the Waste Framework Directive are:\nFurther measures are programmed for the next five years to promote recycling and create a better regulatory environment for recycling activities. An Impact Assessment accompanies the strategy.\nThe other five thematic strategies the Commission is developing under the EU\u2019s 6th Environment Action Programme cover air pollution (presented on 21 Sept. 2005) and marine environment (20 Oct. 2005) as well as soils, pesticides and the urban environment, which are upcoming.\nThematic strategies represent a modern way of decision-making. They are based\non extensive research and consultation with stakeholders, address the issues in\na holistic way that takes into account links with other problems and policy\nareas, and promote Better Regulation.\nSee MEMO\/05\/496 for more details on this Strategy.\nThe full strategy is available at\nA video news release on the strategies on resources and waste is available to television stations and networks free of charge at:","id":"<urn:uuid:724b072d-4416-480f-8044-551ca1a525ff>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/europa.eu\/rapid\/press-release_IP-05-1673_en.htm?locale=en","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9272390604,"token_count":713,"score":2.796875,"int_score":3}
{"text":"|\u2014 Neighborhood of Boston \u2014|\n|Nickname(s): Southie, Sobo|\n|Annexed by Boston||1804|\n|Time zone||Eastern (UTC-5)|\n|Area code(s)||617 \/ 857|\nSouth Boston is a densely populated neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, located south and east of the Fort Point Channel and abutting Dorchester Bay. One of America's oldest and most historic neighborhoods, South Boston is most popularly known as Southie and is today often called Sobo by the young urban professionals who now own the neighborhood. Although formerly known as a working class Irish-American neighborhood, it is also home to the Boston area's small but vibrant Polish and Lithuanian communities and its demographics are rapidly changing. South Boston contains Dorchester Heights, where George Washington forced British troops to evacuate during the American Revolutionary War. In addition to being home to some of the oldest housing projects in the United States, South Boston has also more recently seen property values join the highest in the city.\nGeographically, Dorchester Neck was an isthmus, a narrow strip of land that connected the mainland of the colonial settlement of Dorchester with Dorchester Heights. Landfill has since greatly increased the amount of land on the eastern side of the historical neck, and widened the connection to the mainland to the point that South Boston is no longer considered separate from it. South Boston gained an identity separate from Dorchester, but the two were annexed by Boston in pieces, from 1804 to 1870.\nIt was here on Dorchester Heights, during the American Revolutionary War that George Washington placed his cannon and forced the evacuation of the British troops from Boston on March 17, 1776. The British evacuated Boston and Fort William and Mary for Halifax, Nova Scotia. Fort William and Mary was replaced with a brick fortification known as Fort Independence. That fort was replaced by a granite fortification (bearing the same name) prior to the American Civil War, and still stands on Castle Island as a National Historic Landmark. Edgar Allan Poe was stationed at Castle Island for five months in 1827 and was inspired to write The Cask of Amontillado based on an early Castle Island legend.\nIn the 1990s, South Boston became the focus for a Supreme Court case on the right of gay and lesbian groups to participate in the Saint Patrick's Day (Evacuation Day) parade. The case was decided in favor of the parade's sponsors when the United States Supreme Court supported the South Boston Allied War Veterans' right to determine who can participate in their annual St. Patrick's Day parade. In 1996, local Dorchester author Paul Walkowski and Attorney William Connolly detailed the case in their book \"From Trial Court to the United States Supreme Court\".\n\"Southie\" is home to what is thought to be the first Vietnam veterans memorial in the United States. It predated the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., by 13 months. It was dedicated on September 13, 1981 and is located at Independence Square, which is more commonly called M Street Park.\nIn recent years, the reality of South Boston has changed drastically as property values, especially in the City Point neighborhood near Castle Island, have risen to the level of some of the highest in the city. The City Point area of South Boston, labeled \"East Side\" by realtors, has seen a major increase in property values due to its close proximity to downtown Boston and gentrification. The \"West Side\" of South Boston, also known as the \"lower end\" by lifelong residents, though slower to begin the gentrification process also benefits from the proximity to not only downtown but also the popular South End. Additionally, the West Side is home to the first green residence (Gold LEED certified) in Boston \u2014 the Macallen Building which was featured in the movie The Greening of Southie. The City of Boston is investing in the West Side through developments like the ~150,000-square-foot (14,000 m2) mixed use (residential and commercial) building being developed by the Boston Redevelopment Authority on West Broadway.\nWaterfront redevelopment \nThe section of South Boston north of First Street is targeted for massive redevelopment by the administration of Mayor Thomas Menino and the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA). As of September 2010, the Seaport Square project was expected to cost $3 billion and replace parking lots between the federal courthouse and convention center with a 6,300,000-square-foot (590,000 m2) mixed-use development. Construction was expected to begin in 2011.\nInitially referred to as the \"Seaport District\" by the BRA, this area was officially restyled the \"South Boston Waterfront\" after virulent protest from natives and local politicians, including City Council President James M. Kelly. The Central Artery\/Tunnel (CA\/T) Project, also known as the Big Dig, has created a completely new transportation network for this area and quite a few new hotel and office projects have come online in the past few years. The Boston Convention and Exhibition Center straddles D Street, the Seaport Hotel and Seaport World Trade Center is located on Commonwealth Pier, and a new home for the Institute of Contemporary Art hangs over Boston Harbor just north of Northern Avenue.\nAccording to the Boston Waterfront Guide the South Boston Waterfront now has 55 restaurants, 4 hotels, 9 major attractions and continues to grow. The latest restaurant to open in nearby is Ming Tsai's Blue Dragon Restaurant in the old A Street Deli Building.\nMassChallenge has its headquarters at One Marina Park. Fish and Richardson is also presently at One Marina Park\nPublic schools are operated by Boston Public Schools.\n- South Boston High School, which is now divided into two different high schools all within the same building, 1st floor is Excel High School which focuses on public safety studies, 2nd floor is also Excel High School, which focuses on computer technology, 3rd floor is Boston Green Academy, which focuses on science studies (9-12).\n- James Condon Elementary School (K-5)\n- Joseph P. Tynan School (K-5)\n- Michael J. Perkins School (K-5)\n- Oliver Hazard Perry School (K-8)\n- UP Academy Charter School of Boston (6-8)\n- St. Peter Academy (K-8)\n- South Boston Catholic Academy (K-8) (formerly St. Brigid's School and Gate of Heaven which were combined)\n- Julie's Family Learning Center (P,K,Montessori)\nCultural and language schools \n- Szkola Jezyka Polskiego w Bostonie (John Paul II Polish School for Children and Teens)\n- Wood's School of Irish Dance\nPlaces of worship \nCatholic Churches \n- Our Lady of Czestochowa (Polish)\n- Saint Monica - Saint Augustine (currently closed)\n- Saint Peter (Lithuanian)\n- Saint Vincent de Paul\n- Our Lady of Good Voyage\n- Saint Brigid\nAlbanian Orthodox Churches \n- St George Cathedral: Located near the intersection of East and West Broadway, St George is the largest Orthodox Christian house of worship in Massachusetts. As the mother church of the Albanian diocese, the Cathedral serves as episcopal seat of His Grace, Bishop Nikon, Bishop of Boston, New England and the Albanian Archdiocese.\n- Albanian Holy Trinity Church, Kisha Shqiptare e Shen Trinise: Located at 245 D Street Boston, Massachusetts 02127.\n- St John the Baptist\n- St Matthew and the Redeemer (former)\nCommunity resources \n- South Boston Neighborhood House\n- Boys and Girls Club of Boston\n- Labour\u00e9 Center\n- South Boston Branch Library\n- South Boston Community Health Center\n- South Boston Action Center\n- The Paraclete Center\n- Tynan Community Center\nCastle Island, Pleasure Bay, M Street Beach and Carson Beach \nFort Independence, a pentagonal five-bastioned, granite fort built between 1834 and 1851, is the dominating feature of Castle Island. This 22-acre urban park is connected to the mainland by both pedestrian and vehicular causeways. Pleasure Bay, the M Street Beach and Carson Beach form a three-mile segment of parkland and beach along the South Boston shoreline of Dorchester Bay. Carson Beach offers some beautiful views and great public amenities: a rehabilitated Mothers' Rest, public restrooms, exhibit space, first aid and lifeguard functions, while the outdoor courtyards allow space for passive recreation. Carson Beach also features a walkway which allows one to walk, bike, or run along the water's edge from Castle Island to the Kennedy Library.\nFort Independence and Castle Island are on the State and National Registers of Historic Places, and the fort is a National Historic Landmark. Fort Independence is open from Memorial Day to Columbus Day, hours vary. Fort tours are conducted by the Castle Island Association in the summer months and there is interpretive signage for self-guided tours. The principal program theme, the History of Castle Island, stresses the role of the fort in harbor defense.\"\nDorchester Heights (Thomas Park) \nAtop the Dorchester Heights hill sits a tall monument commemorating the Patriot battery that drove the British out of Boston. A popular site to view the Fourth of July fireworks, the Thomas Park (the oval drive around Dorchester Heights) area is one of the most attractive areas in South Boston.\nMedal Of Honor Park (M Street Park) \nBetween M and N streets and north of Broadway, the M Street Park was one of the most desirable addresses in Boston in the late 19th century, and the brownstone buildings overlooking the park on the south side of the park remain some of the best examples of this style of architecture in New England. M Street Park is also home to the 1st standing Vietnam memorial in the nation included in this memorial are all the names of the South Boston residents who gave their lives fighting for the freedom of the United States. Also a popular spot for, families, dog lovers, and for watching the St Patrick's Day Parade. In addition also, two softball fields, little league field, basketball court, and play ground all attribute to the beautiful neighborhood which is South Boston The M Street Softball League.\nPublic housing \nSouth Boston is home to some of the oldest public housing projects in the United States.[dead link] In the last 30 years they have changed from having a mostly Irish American population to a more ethnically mixed population. The housing facilities are under the control of the Boston Housing Authority (BHA) and include West Broadway which was built in 1949 and occupies 20 acres (81,000 m2), West Ninth Street (these three facilities are next to each other and commonly called D street), Old Colony which was built in 1941, and Mary Ellen McCormack, which is the BHA's oldest development, being constructed in the 1930s. It was originally called Old Harbor Village. 'The West Broadway Ninth Street Projects were knocked down in 2005 and are now a retirement housing building.\nMBTA bus service connects these stations with the residential areas of South Boston, downtown Boston and the Back Bay. The MBTA Silver Line, a Bus rapid transit service running partly in a tunnel from South Station, also serves the north side of South Boston. South Boston is also served by five bus routes including the numbers 5, 7, 9, 10, 11.\nNotable residents \nSouth Boston has been the birthplace and home to a number of notable people, including:\nReferences in popular culture \n- The 2010 crime thriller The Town starring and directed by Ben Affleck, was partly filmed in South Boston.

{"text":"American PoetryIf we define poetry as the heart of man expressed in beautiful language,\nwe shall not say that we have no national poetry. True, America has\nproduced no Shakespeare and no Milton, but we have an inheritance in all\nEnglish literature; and many poets in America have followed in the\nfootsteps of their literary British forefathers.\nPuritan life was severe. It was warfare, and manual labor of a most\nexhausting type, and loneliness, and devotion to a strict sense of duty.\nIt was a life in which pleasure was given the least place and duty the\ngreatest. Our Puritan ancestors thought music and poetry dangerous,\nif not actually sinful, because they made men think of this world rather\nthan of heaven. When Anne Bradstreet wrote our first known American\npoems, she was expressing English thought; \"The tenth muse\" was not\nanimated by the life around her, but was living in a dream of the land\nshe had left behind; her poems are faint echoes of the poetry of England.\nAfter time had identified her with life in the new world, she wrote\n\"Contemplations,\" in which her English nightingales are changed to\ncrickets and her English gilli-flowers to American blackberry vines.\nThe truly representative poetry of colonial times is Michael\nWigglesworth's \"Day of Doom. This is the real heart of the Puritan,\nhis conscience, in imperfect rhyme. It fulfills the first part of our\ndefinition, but shows by its lack of beautiful style that both elements\nare necessary to produce real poetry.\nPhilip Freneau was the first American who sought to express his life in\npoetry. The test of beauty of language again excludes from real poetry\nsome of his expressions and leaves us a few beautiful lyrics, such as\n\"The Wild Honeysuckle,\" in which the poet sings his love of American\nnature. With them American poetry may be said to begin.\nThe first historical event of national importance was the American\nRevolution. Amid the bitter years of want, of suffering, and of war; few\nmen tried to write anything beautiful. Life was harsh and stirring and\nthis note was echoed in all the literature. As a result we have\nnarrative and political poetry, such as \"The Battle of the Kegs\" and \"A\nFable,\" dealing almost entirely with events and aiming to arouse military\nardor. In \"The Ballad of Nathan Hale,\" the musical expression of\nbravery, pride, and sympathy raises the poem so far above the rhymes of\ntheir period that it will long endure as the most memorable poetic\nexpression of the Revolutionary period.\nPoetry was still a thing of the moment, an avocation, not dignified by\nreceiving the best of a man. With William Cullen Bryant came a change.\nHe told our nation that in the new world as well as in the old some men\nshould live for the beautiful. Everything in nature spoke to him in\nterms of human life. Other poets saw the re1ation between their own\nlives and the life of the flowers and the birds, but Bryant constantly\nexpressed this relationship. The concluding stanza of \"To a Waterfowl\"\nis the most perfect example of this characteristic, but it underlies also\nthe whole thought of his youthful poem \"Thanatopsis\" (A View of Death).\nIf we could all read the lives of our gentians and bobolinks as he did,\nthere would be more true poetry in America. Modern thinkers urge us to\nstep outside of ourselves into the lives of others and by our imagination\nto share their emotions; this is no new ambition in America; since Bryant\nin \"The Crowded Street\" analyzes the life in the faces he sees.\nUntil the early part of the nineteenth century American poetry dealt\nmainly with the facts of history and the description of nature. A new\nelement of fancy is prominent in Joseph Rodman Drake's \"The Culprit Fay.\"\nIt dances through a long narrative with the delicacy of the fay himself.\nEdgar Allan Poe brought into our poetry somber sentiment and musical\nexpression. Puritan poetry was somber, but it was almost devoid of\nsentiment. Poe loved sad beauty and meditated on the sad things in life.\nMany of his poems lament the loss of some fair one. \"To Helen,\" \"Annabel\nLee\" \"Lenore,\" and \"To One In Paradise\" have the theme, while in \"The\nRaven\" the poet is seeking solace for the loss of Lenore. \"Eulalie--A\nSong\" rises, on the other hand to intense happiness. With Poe the sound\nby which his idea was expressed was as important as the thought itself.\nHe knew how to make the sound suit the thought, as in \"The Raven\" and\n\"The Bells.\" One who understands no English can grasp the meaning of the\ndifferent sections from the mere sound, so clearly distinguishable are\nthe clashing of the brass and the tolling of the iron bells. If we\nreturn to our definition of poetry as an expression of the heart of a\nman, we shall find the explanation of these peculiarities: Poe was a man\nof moods and possessed the ability to express these moods in appropriate\nThe contrast between the emotion of Poe and the calm spirit of the man\nwho followed him is very great. In Henry Wadsworth Longfellow American\npoetry reached high-water mark. Lacadio Hearn in his \"Interpretations\nof Literature\" says: \"Really I believe that it is a very good test of any\nEnglishman's ability to feel poetry, simply to ask him, `Did you like\nLongfellow when you were a boy?' If he says `No,' then it is no use to\ntalk to him on the subject of poetry at all, however much he might be\nable to tell you about quantities and metres.\" No American has in equal\ndegree won the name of \"household poet.\" If this term is correctly\nunderstood, it sums up his merits more succinctly than can any other\nLongfellow dealt largely with men and women and the emotions common to us\nall. Hiawatha conquering the deer and bison, and hunting in despair for\nfood where only snow and ice abound; Evangeline faithful to her father\nand her lover, and relieving suffering in the rude hospitals of a new\nworld; John Alden fighting the battle between love and duty; Robert of\nSicily learning the lesson of humility; Sir Federigo offering his last\npossession to the woman he loved; Paul Revere serving his country in time\nof need; the monk proving that only a sense of duty done can bring\nhappiness: all these and more express the emotions which we know are true\nin our own lives. In his longer narrative poems he makes the legends of\nPuritan life real to us; he takes English folk-lore and makes us see\nOthere talking to Arthur, and the Viking stealing his bride. His short\npoems are even better known than his longer narratives. In them he\nexpressed his gentle, sincere love of the young, the suffering, and the\nsorrowful. In the Sonnets he showed; that deep appreciation of European\nliterature which made noteworthy his teaching at Harvard and his\nHe believed that he was assigned a definite task in the world which he\ndescribed as follows in his last poem:\n\"As comes the smile to the lips,\nThe foam to the surge;\nSo come to the Poet his songs,\nAll hitherward blown\nFrom the misty realm, that belongs\nTo the vast unknown.\nHis, and not his, are the lays\nHe sings; and their fame\nIs his, and not his; and the praise\nAnd the pride of a name.\nFor voices pursue him by day\nAnd haunt him by night,\nAnd he listens and needs must obey,\nWhen the Angel says: 'Write!'\nJohn Greenleaf Whittier seems to suffer by coming in such close proximity\nto Longfellow. Genuine he was, but his spirit was less buoyant than\nLongfellow's and he touches our hearts less. Most of his early poems\nwere devoted to a current political issue. They aimed to win converts to\nthe cause of anti-slavery. Such poems always suffer in time in\ncomparison with the song of a man who sings because \"the heart is so full\nthat a drop overfills it.\" Whittier's later poems belong more to this\nclass and some of them speak to-day to our emotions as well as to our\nintellects. \"The Hero\" moves us with a desire to serve mankind, and the\nstirring tone of \"Barbara Frietchie\" arouses our patriotism by its\npicture of the same type of bravery. In similar vein is \"Barclay of\nUry,\" which must have touched deeply the heart of the Quaker poet. \"The\nPipes of Lucknow\" is dramatic in its intense grasp of a climactic hour\nand loses none of its force in the expression. We can actually hear the\nskirl of the bagpipes. Whittier knew the artists of the world and talked\nto us about Raphael and Burns with clear-sighted, affectionate interest.\nHis poems show varied characteristics; the love of the sterner aspects of\nnature, modified by the appreciation of the humble flower; the conscience\nof the Puritan, tinged with sympathy for the sorrowful; the steadfastness\nof the Quaker, stirred by the fire of the patriot.\nThe poetry of Ralph Waldo Emerson is marked by serious contemplation\nrather than by warmth of emotional expression. In Longfellow the appeal\nis constantly to a heart which is not disassociated from a brain; in\nEmerson the appeal is often to the intellect alone. We recognize the\nforce of the lesson in \"The Titmouse,\" even if it leaves us less devoted\ncitizens than does \"The Hero\" and less capable women than does\n\"Evangeline.\" He reaches his highest excellence when he makes us feel as\nwell as understand a lesson, as in \"The Concord Hymn\" and \"Forbearance.\"\nIf we could all write on the tablets of our hearts that single stanza,\nforbearance would be a real factor in life. And it is to this poet whom\nwe call unemotional that we owe this inspiring quatrain:\n\"So nigh is grandeur to our dust,\nSo near is God to man,\nWhen duty whispers low, Thou must,\nThe youth replies, I can!\"\nJames Russell Lowell was animated by a well-defined purpose which he\ndescribed in the following lines:\n\"It may be glorious to write\nThoughts that make glad the two or three\nHigh souls like those far stars that come in sight\nOnce in a century.\nBut better far it is to speak\nOne simple word which, now and then\nShall waken their free nature in the weak\nAnd friendless sons of men.\nTo write some earnest verse or line\nWhich, seeking not the praise of art,\nShall make a clearer faith and manhood shine\nIn the untutored heart.\"\nHis very accomplishments made it difficult for him to reach this aim,\nsince his poetry does not move \"the untutored heart\" so readily as does\nthat of Longfellow or Whittier. It is, on the whole, too deeply burdened\nwith learning and too individual in expression to fulfil his highest\ndesire. Of his early poems the most generally known is probably \"The\nVision of Sir Launfal,\" in which a strong moral purpose is combined with\nlines of beautiful nature description:\n\"And what is so rare as a day in June?\nThen, if ever, come perfect days.\nTwo works by which he will be permanently remembered show a deeper and\nmore effective Lowell. \"The Biglow Papers\" are the most successful of\nall the American poems which attempt to improve conditions by means of\nhumor. Although they refer in the main to the situation at the time of\nthe Mexican War, they deal with such universal political traits that they\nmay be applied to almost any age. They are written in a Yankee dialect\nwhich, it is asserted, was never spoken, but which enhances the humor, as\nin \"What Mr. Robinson Thinks.\" Lowell's tribute to Lincoln occurs in the\nOde which he wrote to commemorate the Harvard students who enlisted in\nthe Civil War. After dwelling on the search for truth which should be\nthe aim of every college student, he turns to the delineation of\nLincoln's character in a eulogy of great beauty. Clear in analysis, far-\nsighted in judgment, and loving in sentiment, he expresses that opinion\nof Lincoln which has become a part of the web of American thought. His\nis no hurried judgment, but the calm statement of opinion which is to-day\naccepted by the world:\n\"They all are gone, and, standing like a tower,\nOur children shall behold his fame,\nThe kindly-earnest, brave, foreseeing man,\nSagacious, patient, dreading, praise, not blame,\nNow birth of our new soil, the first American.\"\nWith Oliver Wendell Holmes comes the last of this brief American list of\nhonor. No other American has so combined delicacy with the New England\nhumor. We should be poorer by many a smile without \"My Aunt\" and \"The\nDeacon's Masterpiece.\" But this is not his entire gift. \"The Chambered\nNautilus\" strikes the chord of noble sentiment sounded in the last stanza\nof \"Thanatopsis\" and it will continue to sing in our hearts \"As the swift\nseasons roll.\" There is in his poems the smile and the sigh of the well-\n\"And if I should live to be\nThe last leaf upon the tree\nIn the Spring.\nLet them smile; as I do now;\nAs the old forsaken bough\nWhere I cling.\"\nAnd is this all? Around these few names does all the fragrance of\nAmerican poetry hover? In the hurry, prosperity, and luxury of modern\nlife is the care if the flower of poetry lost? Surely not. The last\nhalf of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth have\nbrought many beautiful flowers of poetry and hints of more perfect\nblossoms. Lanier has sung of the life of the south he loved; Whitman and\nMiller have stirred us with enthusiasm for the progress of the nation;\nField and Riley have made us laugh and cry in sympathy; Aldrich, Sill,\nVan Dyke, Burroughs, and Thoreau have shared with us their hoard of\nbeauty.

{"text":"Published: Oct. 17, 2006\nUpdated: Apr. 20, 2010\nTwo-and-a-half-year-old Nina was bright-eyed and bouncy, full of laughter and hugs -- when you could get her attention. She often seemed to be ignoring her parents when they spoke to her, and when she did respond, many of her words were slurred.\nConcerned, her parents arranged for a hearing test -- and learned that Nina had moderate hearing loss in both ears. Outfitted with a hearing aid, and provided with speech therapy, she is just beginning to regain some of the ground she lost during the first years of life when important language skills are being learned.\n\"Hearing impairment is the largest congenital disability, affecting about six out of every 1,000 infants,\" says Duke pediatric audiologist Ann Mabie. \"For a very long time, people thought you couldn't test infants' hearing, and would just wait until children were two or three years old. But by the time you wait for children not to talk, a window of opportunity has shut.\"\nIn fact, those tiny, shell-like ears that parents marvel over when getting to know their new babies are just the most visible parts of a highly sophisticated machine. Human infants spend the first year of life learning about their environment, and by one year of age, already understand far more language than they are yet able to use -- unless an undiagnosed hearing impairment disrupts the process.\nWhile hearing impairments are difficult at any age, they\u2019re especially devastating in young children, because their brains rely on auditory stimulation to develop the capacity for oral communication. This makes early diagnosis and treatment of childhood hearing losses essential.\nHappily, all newborns in North Carolina now have access to the specialized screening needed to diagnose infants with hearing loss, thanks to state legislation passed in October 1999.\nEven babies born with normal hearing, however, can develop a hearing loss later in infancy or childhood, due to ear infections or head injuries. So parents should be aware of clues that their children might have difficulty hearing and insist on tests if they suspect hearing loss (see below).\nMabie urges all parents who suspect that their child might have a hearing problem to get the child tested by an audiologist or physician with expertise in this area as soon as possible: \"Every day you wait is a day lost.\"\nHearing impairments caused by problems in the middle and outer ear can sometimes be treated medically. For impairments originating in the inner ear, a hearing aid and speech therapy can help. \"Hearing aids help provide access to speech, and with some intensive speech and language therapy, hearing-impaired kids will do fine in a normal classroom.\"\nChildren with severe to profound hearing impairments typically will require more extensive rehabilitation, and cochlear implantation may be indicated. At Duke, otolaryngologists have begun using sophisticated new technologies to help even tiny children with hearing impairments to interact with the hearing world.\nWhen Lauren, a two-month-old infant from western North Carolina, was diagnosed with profound hearing loss due to a malformation in her inner ears, or cochleas, she was immediately fitted with hearing aids. Shortly before her second birthday, she came to Duke for a cochlear implant.\nDuke specialists in speech pathology and audiology worked to perform a detailed evaluation of Lauren\u2019s hearing loss, using the most precise diagnostic technologies available. Duke neurotologist (ear specialist) Debara Tucci, MD, then selected the cochlear implant that would be most appropriate for Lauren.\nAfter Tucci surgically implanted the mechanism -- a marvel of micro-engineering -- into Lauren\u2019s inner ear, the tiny computer chip that controls the implant was carefully adjusted to transmit just the right auditory signals to Lauren\u2019s brain. The result is a girl who is learning how to communicate with those around her right on schedule.\nWhatever intervention a child with hearing deficiencies may need, time is of the essence. As the mother of one hearing-impaired child puts it, \"Once you find out and take action, things only get better, not worse.\u201d\nIf your child exhibits any of the following behaviors, have him or her checked by a professional audiologist or physician with expertise in hearing disorders.","id":"<urn:uuid:2e03df66-fa9b-468c-9fa8-487fd46503ea>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.dukehealth.org\/health_library\/health_articles\/hear_hear\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9694573283,"token_count":888,"score":3.125,"int_score":3}

The only work Bacon ever published in English, it was later expanded and latinized into De augmentis scientiarum (1623). In the Twoo bookes, Bacon concerned himself primarily with the classification of philosophy and the sciences and with developing his influential view of the relation between science and theology. While preserving the traditional distinction between knowledge obtained by divine revelation and knowledge acquired through the senses, Bacon saw both theoretical and applied science as religious duties, the first for a greater knowledge of God through his creation, and the second for the practice of charity to one\u2019s fellows by improving their condition.

{"text":"Demands for lower cost manufacturing, lighter components, and recycleability are forcing manufacturers to switch from metal components to plastic.

Ultrasonic, hot-plate, spin, thermal,\nlaser, and vibration welding are the most common plastic assembly methods.\nChoosing the correct method can be difficult. A supplier who has technical\nknowledge in all of the processes is the best choice. They will have knowledge\nof all the different process joint designs, can provide assistance in material\nselection, and can support once the process is in production.\npart requirement before the design of the plastic part is critical.\nThis will save dollars in tooling costs and help assure that the correct\nprocess to achieve the requirements is chosen. All too often, the plastic\nmolds are manufactured, the first parts are assembled, and then quality\ncontrol determines that the parts will not pass a pressure test. This\nis too late; now significant dollars will need to be spent to correct\nproblem. Requirements such as a need for pressurization, exposure to\nextreme cold or heat, cosmetic-part status (requires no blemishes),\nand parts assembled\nper minute are all factors in determining the correct process and plastic\nEach process has unique plastic-joint design requirements to assure\nproper weld strength. Assembly equipment suppliers can help design the\nweld area joint design. An example of joint design requirements for ultrasonic\nassembly is given by Guide to Ultrasonics from Dukane\nCharles, IL, U.S.): \"Mating services should be in intimate contact around the entire joint. The joint should be in one plane, if possible. A small initial contact area should be established between mating halves. A means of alignment is recommended so that mating halves do not misalign during the weld operation.\" Obviously,\nthese joint requirements should all be designed into the part prior to\nmachining of the injection molds.\nWhat assembly process is correct for a part? As stated earlier, ultrasonic, hot-plate, spin, thermal, vibration, and laser welding are the most common methods used in production today. Each method has unique advantages.\nUltrasonic assembly is a fast, repeatable, and reliable process that allows for sophisticated process control. High-volume small parts that have very tight assembly tolerances lend themselves well to ultrasonic assembly. Ultrasonic systems have the capability of exporting relevant assembly process data for SPC documentation and FDA validation. Ultrasonic welding can be easily integrated into automated systems.\nHot-plate welding can accommodate a wide range of parts sizes and configurations. These machines offer high-reliability hermetic seals and strong mechanical bonds on complex part geometries. The process is fairly simple; the two parts to be jointed are brought in close proximity to a heated platen until the joint area is in a molten state. The platen is removed and the parts are clamped together until the joint cools off and returns to a solid state.\nSpin welding is a very cost-effective method for joining large, medium, or small circular parts such as washing machine tubs to agitator components. Water purification filters, thermal mugs, and irrigation assemblies typically are joined using the spin welding process. Careful attention to joint design is critical for parts that require flash-free appearance.\nAssemblies that require inserts at multiple points on multiple planes, like computer or vacuum cleaner housings, typically benefit from thermal insertion\/staking. Thermal staking is ideal for attachment of non-plastic components to the plastic housing, such as circuit boards and metal brackets. Dates coding, embossing, and degating are other uses for thermal presses. Thermal welding can be a slower assembly process than ultrasonic, so, depending on the volumes of assemblies required, ultrasonic maybe a better choice.\nVibration welding physically moves one of the two parts horizontally under pressure to create heat through surface friction. Compared to ultrasonic welding, vibration welding operates at much lower frequencies, much higher amplitude, and with greater clamping force. The limitation to vibration welding is simply that the joint must be in a single plane in at least one axis in order to allow the vibration motion. Like hot-plate welding, vibration welding is a highly reliable process that can handle large parts in challenging materials or multiple parts per cycle with ease. Chain saw housings, blower and pump assemblies, and large refrigerator bins are examples of potential vibration welding applications. Cycle times for vibration welds are very short, thus they are ideal for high volume and are easily automated.\nLaser welding is the newest technology of the processes available today. One benefit of laser welding is that the weld joints produce no flash or particulate outside of the joint. Assemblies that require absolutely no contamination for particulate, like medical filters, are good candidates. A second benefit is that the assembly is not exposed to heat or vibration. Devices that have very sensitive electronic internal components that may be damaged from vibration can now be assembled effectively. Laser welding requires the parts to be transmissive and absorbive, specifically how transparent the parts appear to the laser beam. One material transmits the coherent laser light and the other material absorbs the light and converts it to heat.

{"text":"How to get Shading Right\nRecent improvements to window technology make substantial air conditioning energy savings possible. However, shading remains a time-tested method to accomplish the same end.\nArchitectural and site shading can have an even greater impact on reducing daily cooling use than upgrading windows. Using both a prototype building and modeling simulations, a study by our team at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) evaluated the relative impacts of different solar load control strategies. The study points the way toward optimizing the interaction of various methods for reducing solar heat gain. This is helpful,as the wide variety of shading options currently available can make choosing an effective solar load control strategy confusing (see Snapshots of Shading Options,HE Sept\/Oct '00,p.20).\nThe prototype house was built in 1998 in Tucson, Arizona, as part of the Department of Energy's Building America program.Its integrated package of energy-saving features includes structural insulated panels (SIPs) for the wall and roof construction, white coating on the roof, spectrally selective windows, architectural shading, an interior location for the air handler and ducts, highefficiency air conditioning equipment, and solar water heating.\nBuilding America (see Clean Breathing in Tract Homes,p. 29) works with five building industry teams to produce advanced residential buildings on a community scale. Systems incorporated into these houses are evaluated by conducting successive design, test, redesign,and retest iterations until cost and performance trade-offs yield innovations that can be cost effectively implemented in production-scale housing.RGC CourtHomes,Inc., built the prototype, with input from the IBACOS Building America Consortium.\nBuilding performance was modeled using a detailed hourly energy simulation tool and was measured while the building was unoccupied for a period of 12 days. Model inputs included direct measurements of the net air exchange rate, surface reflectance,and window transmittance. Model results, after calibration,showed good agreement with the direct measurements of cooling loads and air conditioning energy use. Analyzing the interactions between building performance and solar load control strategies in a prototype house can facilitate the optimization of cost and performance trade-offs in large-scale production.\nTypical new productionscale houses in the Tucson market are framed on a slabon- grade foundation with stucco exterior finish and a sloped concrete tile or flat built-up bituminous roof. These standard-practice houses are built using standard construction materials and techniques, including nominal 2 x 4 wood framing,fiberglass batt insulation,1-inch polystyrene sheathing,and double- pane,clear-glass,aluminum frame windows. The slab foundation has no insulation,and the attic is usually vented. A forcedair distribution system provides space heating and cooling,with the air handler located in the garage and the flex duct in the attic. This system is typically supplied by a 10-SEER air conditioner and an 80% annual fuel utilization efficiency (AFUE) gas furnace.\nThe prototype house differs from these houses in several respects. It has a well-insulated airtight envelope, with minimized air distribution losses. The house's energy-saving features, plus the large ratio of window to floor area in the design, render window contributions more important than they are in conventional housing, particularly in the Tucson climate.\nThe prototype incorporates several reengineered features into its structural and mechanical equipment systems (see Table 1). Envelope changes include a sealed, insulated, and conditioned crawlspace foundation (a shallow basement) and SIPs (see SIPs Face the Skeptics,HE,Mar\/Apr '98). The foundation stem walls are 6-inchthick reinforced concrete, insulated on the interior with a 2-inch-thick rigid foam board (R-10) that serves as the concrete form. Each wall and roof panel consists of a polyurethane foam core sandwiched between 7\/16- inch thick oriented strand board (OSB) sheathing. SIPs 41\/2 -inches thick are used for the walls, and SIPs 61\/2 -inches thick form the flat lowslope ceiling\/roof assembly. The walls are finished with synthetic stucco on the exterior. The roof panels are finished with a white singleply rubberized fabric coating on the exterior (the inside is cathedralized, with no attic space). The windows have vinyl frames with a thermal break,double panes, and spectrally selective coatings on the inside of the outer pane (surface two) of the tinted glazing.\nMechanical system features include putting the air handler in an interior chase, locating all ductwork within the conditioned space,and installing a 12-SEER (seasonal energy efficiency ratio) air conditioner. A batch-type solar water heater, with an integral collector storage unit,preheats domestic hot water. The gasfired water heater is coupled with an integrated hydronic space-heating coil in the air handler. The house has a controlled-ventilation system consisting of a separate,single-speed and manual-switch fan that supplies fresh air on demand from the outside to the air handler return plenum.\nThis ranch-style house is located in a high-density, single-family residential development (see cover photo). The architectural plan has approximately 1,170 ft2 of floor area, including two bedrooms and two bathrooms. The house has a relatively large window area with 272 ft2; four sliding glass doors facing a patio make up about 80% of this window area. The sliding glass doors are partially shaded by the patio cover,which is 24 ft long, 6 ft wide, and 10 ft above ground level (see photograph on p. 24). The front entrance is a solid wood door. Another overhang on the front elevation of the house is an open horizontal trellis made of nominal 2 x 6 lumber; vegetation has been planted and is intended to grow over it. Prior to testing, the interior of the house was fully finished and landscaping was complete. No interior window coverings were installed during the test period.\nBuilding performance measurements included environmental conditions, net air exchange rate,and electric power use during normal operation of the building (see Measuring Thermal Performance). In addition, cooling loads were measured using a co-cooling test protocol in which a six-zone portable air conditioning unit was substituted for the building\u2019s air conditioner. The modeled and measured results were compared; the results showed good agreement for cooling loads and air conditioning energy use. The model was then used to evaluate annual energy use and the impacts of alternative solar load control strategies over a broader range of conditions than could be measured in the field.\nThe simulation model includes accurate building geometry to account for the effects of shading on windows and walls. The windows are all generally well shaded, either by overhangs or by the adjacent houses. The simulation model was imported into a three-dimensional graphic representation program that has rotational view capabilities to check building geometry.Figure 1 shows the location of exterior walls, windows,doors, and overhangs. Crawlspace walls are evident in this view. Shading from adjacent houses is significant at this site. The geometry of houses and fences to the east and west are modeled as measured at the site; these shading surfaces are also shown in the figure.\nHow the Shading Options Added Up\nFor the determination of annual heating and cooling energy,occupied building operation is simulated. The simulation of occupied conditions in this building for a full year predicts that 3,285 kWh of cooling energy and 71 therms of space-heating energy are required per year. Heat gain through the windows is the largest component of envelope load, and it constitutes more than 30% of the total cooling energy load (see Figures 2 and 3).\nFigure 4 presents the daily load profiles of air conditioning electricity use on a typical cooling day for four combinations of glazing and shading. In this case, the shading includes both the architectural overhangs and the site shading from adjacent buildings. Standard glazing without shading represents the worst case, and spectrally selective glazing with shading (the existing building) represents the best case. The combination of high-performance glazing and shading achieves a 0.4 kW (14%) reduction in afternoon peak electricity demand and a 12.4 kWh (30%) reduction in daily total electricity used for air conditioning. Architectural and site shading reduces daily cooling use more than upgrading the windows does. The shading combination reduces daily cooling energy use by 9.4 kWh (22%), as compared to 4.4 kWh (11%) for just upgrading the windows.\nArchitectural shading is clearly very important in reducing cooling loads. It reduces the annual cooling requirement by approximately 23%, whether one starts with standard double-pane glazing or with spectrally selective glazing. In both cases, the heating load increases as the solar gain is reduced, but thanks to the combination of the Tucson climate and the wellinsulated tight building shell, this has little impact. Even in the worst\ncase scenario, less than 80 therms per year of space heating is required.\nIn this housing development, site shading plays an important role in reducing morning and evening direct solar gain. The test house is shaded to the east and west by adjacent, two-story houses. This site shading not only reduces the solar gain through the windows, but effectively shades much of the exterior wall area, reducing overall conductive gains as well.\nAnnual Energy Costs\nThe cooling and heating loads are combined into a single value by converting the energy requirements to costs. The study assumed that electricity costs 10.5\u00a2\/kWh, and natural gas costs 79\u00a2\/therm for the first 20 therms a month and 75\u00a2\/therm above that. Figure 5 shows annual cooling and heating costs as a function of glazing type, two types of shading, and the orientation of the front of the house. Using the data from this figure and referencing a base case building with standard windows with no overhangs but with adjacent building shading, Table 2 presents the reduction in cooling and heating costs for a subset of combinations.\nThe existing building has a south orientation, and the combined features lead to a 26% reduction in cooling and heating costs. The total cost of cooling and heating is reduced by more than 10% by adding the presence of the adjacent houses. As expected, the maximum effect from architectural shading occurs if the front of the house faces west, which orients most of the window area to the south. The maximum effect of site shading occurs if the front of the house faces north, which orients most of the window area to the west.With the front facing east, the majority of windows are on the north side, and neither architectural nor site shading has much effect on cooling and heating costs.\n- FIRST PAGE\n- PREVIOUS PAGE\nEnter your comments in the box below:\n(Please note that all comments are subject to review prior to posting.)","id":"<urn:uuid:7fc7b7ef-acfe-4630-b7d8-bbc8efdadf7d>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.homeenergy.org\/newsite2011\/public\/index.php\/show\/article\/nav\/buildingamerica\/page\/4\/id\/242","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9414861202,"token_count":2245,"score":2.921875,"int_score":3}

It has been estimated that its magnitude was 8.1.\n- 1946 Dominican Republic earthquake (4 August): This 8.0-magnitude quake in Saman\u00e1 also shook Haiti horrifically, producing a tsunami that killed 1,600 people.\n- 2010 Haiti earthquake (12 January):. The epicentre of this magnitude 7.0 Mw earthquake was near L\u00e9og\u00e2ne, approximately 25 km (16 miles) west of Port-au-Prince. at a depth of 13 km (8.1 miles). The United States Geological Survey recorded a series of at least 33 aftershocks, 14 of which were between magnitudes 5.0 and 5.9. The International Red Cross estimated that about three million people were affected by the quake; the Haitian Government reports that over 316,000 people had been identified as dead, an estimated 300,000 injured, and an estimated 1,000,000 homeless.\n12 January 2010 earthquake \nEric Calais, a geophysicist at Purdue University who has researched in the area for years, and Ross Stein of the United States Geological Survey in Menlo Park, California, and colleagues have independently calculated that the earthquake has increased the risk on other segments of the Enriquillo fault and perhaps on other faults, although the quake probably did not increase the risk (which is already known to be high) of a major tremor on the Septentrional fault. Stein suggests that if the calculations are right\u2014noting that they may well not be\u2014something may be \"fundamentally locked in some fashion, on pretty much all scales, and might be capable of popping off something large\". Historical accounts, although not precise, suggest that there has been a sequence of quakes progressing westwards along the fault, starting with an earthquake in the Dominican Republic in 2010.

Welcome to OnLineLessonVideos.com. I\u2019m Ian Walsh and I\u2019m going to teach an Irish tune today on the fiddle. It\u2019s called the Golden Eagle and it\u2019s a horn pipe. We\u2019ll play it in the key of G.\nI\u2019ll start off by playing you a sample of the tune along to a quick track that I\u2019ve set at about 70 beats per minute. So here we go with the Golden Eagle.\nLet\u2019s begin by leading into this tune with some pickup notes. We\u2019ll start on the C, this is on the A string here. You work up A, B, C which plays right next to your first finger pretty much right on top of it. So that could be our first note and we\u2019ll start with the triplet here. So three notes and then we\u2019ll go to the G. So let\u2019s just cycle through that a few times [Demonstration]. Try sliding into your first note, the C and I\u2019ll give it a little bit of an aggressive edge [Demonstration].\nLet\u2019s take a look at another section here, we go down to our B on the g string and we play. So we\u2019re crossing three strings, pretty quickly there and I\u2019m not doing anything special with my bow. I\u2019m keeping my bow movement short and I\u2019m working at the top of my bow but I\u2019m not slurring any notes, I\u2019m going straight up and down here. So from B [Demonstration], so those notes are B, D, G, B.\nLet\u2019s take a look at another section here. We start with the open D. This is a little bit easier, you\u2019re only working across two strings and you\u2019re using your first and third fingers.\nLet\u2019s take a look at another one. This is more or less a G arpeggio and it starts on the G on the d string and we play [Demonstration]. So again, you\u2019re moving across three strings here ending on the e string on that G note with your second finger.\nSo let\u2019s go back to the beginning here and we\u2019ll look at that pickup note, the C, B, A down to your first note of the tune, the G. Take a look at the second little section. You go down to that low B and all the way up to the B again. Then we look here to the low D [Demonstration] and then finally we have that G arpeggio [Demonstration].\nNotice I\u2019m leaving my fingers down on the A string here. You can visualize two of the double stamps that are readily apparent here for the G. You can use a G with a D with your A and your E string or you can do the G and the B. Leaving your fingers down can be good practice for getting your fingers just on the individual strings.\nLet\u2019s put all of these together and see what it sounds like. I\u2019ll count us in, one, two, three, [Demonstration] one, two, three [Demonstration].

{"text":"The Savannah River Site is likely a prime contender for storing spent nuclear fuel for decades to come, according to a report released Thursday.\nThe study by Robert Alvarez, a former senior adviser at the Department of Energy and professor at Johns Hopkins University, outlines the possible impact of making SRS an interim storage site for the country\u2019s commercial nuclear power plant waste.\nRecently formed environmental group Don\u2019t Waste Aiken commissioned Alvarez, an expert on nuclear waste with Washington, D.C., think tank The Policy Institute, to produce a study outlining the impact of storing spent nuclear fuel at SRS.\nSpeaking at a press conference announcing his findings, Alvarez outlined the amount of radioactivity spent fuel could bring \u2013 more than double the radioactivity present at SRS currently in high-level waste could be delivered.\nHigh level liquid waste tanks at SRS have near 280 million curies of radioactivity. Spent fuel looking to be stored could bring 1 billion curies to the DOE-owned site.\n\u201cThis would be one of the largest concentrations of radioactivity in the United States in one place\u201d Alvarez said. \u201cI\u2019m not questioning the ability of the people at Savannah River to handle this material. I\u2019m really trying to give people an idea of what the implications are.\u201d\nThe report also said some 2,500 shipments of high-level waste initially could travel across the nation\u2019s highways for storage at SRS if sent by truck; however, Alvarez noted that he thought a single repository was unlikely and impractical.\nAlvarez\u2019 report will be officially released Thursday as discussion intensifies over how to deal with the nation\u2019s growing amount of commercial power plant waste. The nation today has about 70,000 tons of spent fuel. The deadly material was originally scheduled to go to Yucca Mountain, Nev., for disposal, but President Obama canceled the project in 2010 after citing environmental concerns. Last month, the Department of Energy released a three-point plan for replacing Yucca Mountain. The plan calls for establishing an interim storage site by 2021 and a larger interim storage site by 2025. A permanent disposal ground would be available by 2048, according to the DOE.\nAlthough there is no official proposal to build an interim storage site at SRS, the Site\u2019s history in dealing with waste, its workforce, community support and infrastructure make it an obvious contender.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where there is a better site,\u201d Alvarez said Thursday. \u201cSRS is not the only option.\u201d\nOverall, Alvarez said that wherever the waste is stored, the safest way to store it is in dry casks that are in a large enough structure to withstand a possible seismic event. He recommended changes in law that would allow DOE to assume title over spent fuel at private reactor sites and then construct dry storage facilities there.","id":"<urn:uuid:44691f5b-30b7-4bfb-8d34-4252868c4489>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.aikenstandard.com\/article\/20130301\/AIK0101\/130309998\/1004\/study-outlines-impact-of-waste-storage-at-srs","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9562571049,"token_count":590,"score":2.625,"int_score":3}
{"text":"ASIA NEWS NETWORK\nWE KNOW ASIA BETTER\nPublication Date : 04-09-2012\nWith health and wellness gaining prominence in people\u2019s wish lists, there is now a growing awareness of healthier choices.\nHere are more answers for your myriad of options. Pick a wellness plan that will suit you best.\nPlease explain\u2014what\u2019s all the fuss over over nitrates and nitrites?\nMultiple choice: Which meal would you consider supportive of brain health?\na) Scrambled eggs cooked in butter plus a generous topping of cheese and sour cream\nb) Green salad with lean chicken or turkey ham topped with low-fat Caesar salad dressing.\nA is the healthier meal. For one, eggs are nutritious and are considered brain food.\nVegetables are very good for you; however, we do not know about the toppings. Perhaps the ham is laced with preservatives and additives, including aspartame and nitrite. By itself, nitrite isn\u2019t so bad. But when it is eaten, it can transform into nitrosamine compounds, considered potent cancer-causing chemicals.\nThis occurs when a chemical reaction happens between nitrate (added to food) and amines (found in protein that is present in the body).\nAdded to processed foods, this chemical, also known as sodium nitrite or potassium nitrite, prevents the contamination of foods by controlling the toxin production of clostridium botulinum (which causes botulism). In the US, these chemicals are allowed to be used, setting the limit to one part nitrite to 120 parts per million.\nNitrates for fertilisers are suspected to enter the food and water supply. And this is why proper farming is a big issue.\nNitrite and nitrosamine are linked with increased cancer of the colon, lung, pancreas, liver, etc.\nHow to neutralise nitrite poisoning? Take megadoses of vitamin C and E, beta-carotene and flavonoids.\nVisit your dentist\nHow do I cure bad breath?\nWould you believe that billions of bacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites live in our mouths? It\u2019s true. There are over 600 species of bacteria that claim our mouths as their home. An overgrowth of bacteria leads to tooth decay and gum disease. It could, one day, lead to tooth loss. If you are brushing, flossing and gargling regularly, then you shouldn\u2019t have a real problem.\nBut if you don\u2019t, then it\u2019s time to visit your dentist. Dental plaque, a sticky, grainy film that grows on teeth due to the mixture of bacteria with the sugars and starches from the food you eat, causes bad breath. Tartar is the hardened plaque build-up after so much dental neglect.\nBrush or floss twice daily, thrice if you can. Do not sleep without doing your cleansing ritual. Eradicate parasites from your tummy.\nLooking at yourself in the mirror and then smiling is a practice that can get you started on better dental health. Run your tongue over your teeth. If it feels grainy, then it\u2019s time for your dental check-up and cleaning.\nMake it a habit to take two acidophilus (good bacteria) capsules daily.\nConsider digestive enzymes, one to three tablets daily or eat fresh, raw (uncooked) fruits and vegetables.\nJuice fresh veggies\/fruits as your morning starter, tonic and cleanser.\nChlorophyll tablets could be taken.\nSteep parsley leaves in hot water and sip as a tea.\nRule out parasites.

{"text":"Other Proposed Treatments\nIt is one of the cardinal principles of natural medicine that treatment should aim not only to treat illness but also to enhance wellness. According to this ideal, a proper course of treatment should improve your sense of general well-being, enhance your immunity to illness, raise your physical stamina, and increase mental alertness, as well as resolve the specific condition you took it for.\nUnfortunately, while there can be little doubt that this is a laudable goal, it is easier to laud it than to achieve it. Conventional medicine tends to focus on treating diseases rather than increasing wellness, not as a matter of philosophical principle, but because it is easier to accomplish.\nProbably the strongest force affecting wellness is genetics. Beyond that, common sense steps endorsed by all physicians include increasing exercise, reducing stress, improving diet, getting enough sleep, and living a life of moderation without bad habits, such as smoking or overeating.\nBeyond this, however, it is difficult to make strong affirmations, and the optimum forms of diet and exercise and other aspects of lifestyle remain unclear. In fact, they may always remain unclear, as it is impossible to perform double-blind, placebo-controlled studies on most lifestyle habits. (For information on why such studies are irreplaceable see \"Why Does This Database Depend on Double-blind Studies?\" )\nPrincipal Proposed Natural Treatments\nIn order to function at our best, we need good nutrition. However, the modern diet often fails to provide people with sufficient amounts of all the necessary nutrients. For this reason, use of a multivitamin\/multimineral supplement might be expected to enhance overall health and well-being, and preliminary double-blind trials generally support this view.\nFor more information, see the article on General Nutritional Support .\nThe herb Panax ginseng has an ancient reputation as a healthful \u201ctonic.\u201d According to a more modern concept developed in the former USSR, ginseng functions as an \u201cadaptogen.\u201d\nThis term is defined as follows: An adaptogen helps the body adapt to stresses of various kinds, whether heat, cold, exertion, trauma, sleep deprivation, toxic exposure, radiation, infection, or psychologic stress. In addition, an adaptogen causes no side effects, is effective in treating a wide variety of illnesses, and helps return an organism toward balance no matter what may have gone wrong.\nFrom a modern scientific perspective, it is not truly clear that such things as adaptogens actually exist. However, there is some evidence that ginseng may satisfy some of the definition\u2019s requirements.\nIn addition, ginseng has also shown some potential for enhancing immunity , mental function , and sports performance , all effects consistent with the adaptogen concept. For more information on these possibilities, as well as dosage and safety issues, see the full Ginseng article .\nOther Proposed Natural Treatments\nNumerous other alternative therapies are claimed by their proponents to improve overall wellness, including acupuncture , Ayurveda , chiropractic , detoxification , homeopathy , massage , naturopathy , osteopathic manipulation , Reiki , Tai Chi , Therapeutic Touch , traditional Chinese herbal medicine , and yoga . However, there is as yet little meaningful evidence to support these claims.\nFor a discussion of homeopathic approaches to general wellness, see the Homeopathy database .\n- Reviewer: EBSCO CAM Review Board\n- Review Date: 07\/2012 -\n- Update Date: 07\/25\/2012 -","id":"<urn:uuid:39bb84af-9a63-43d7-b933-3bee4727c361>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/memorialhospitaljax.com\/your-health\/?\/38569\/general-well-being","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9366875887,"token_count":726,"score":2.90625,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Should I Be a Strict or Lenient Parent?\nTo be strict or not to be strict, that is the question \u2013 in fact, it\u2019s the number-one question among child-rearing and education authorities, among teachers and, of course, parents. It\u2019s doubtful that there is a parent who hasn\u2019t at one time or another agonized over this.\nThere is a widespread uncertainty on how to be at home (or how to come across in the classroom) \u2013 tough or soft, to be a strict disciplinarian or a permissivist. Have you noticed, however, that you seldom hear a parent or teacher admit \u201cI am authoritarian\u201d or \u201cI am permissive\u201d? These are terms reserved for those with whom you disagree.\nThe question, whether to be strict or lenient, never ceases to be debated in books and articles, or at conferences and conventions. Dr. Gordon points out that this question is what social scientists call a \u201cpseudo problem\u201d and how it also is a clear case of \u201ceither-or thinking\u201d. Let\u2019s take a look at what he means by that.\nSeldom parents or teachers seem to recognize that it is not necessary to make a choice between these two leadership styles. Few adults know it, but there is an alternative to being at either end of the strictness-leniency scale. There is the choice of a third style.\nThis alternative is being neither authoritarian nor permissive, neither strict nor lenient. Does that mean being somewhere near the middle of the scale\u2013moderately strict or moderately lenient? Not at all. The alternative is not being on the scale at all! How so?\nAuthoritarian leadership\u2013whether at home or in the classroom\u2013means that the control is in the hands of the adult leader. It has been researched and proven for decades how ineffective maintaining control through power is. Authoritarianism often creates fearful and subservient children and\/or rebellion.\nStill, no parent or teacher really wants to suffer the chaotic consequences of unrestricted freedom and lawless permissiveness either. It\u2019s also true that most children are uncomfortable with the consequences of permissiveness. Permissive leadership means that control has been \u201cpermitted\u201d to be in the hands of the youngsters. Children of permissive parents usually feel guilty about always getting their way. They also feel insecure about being loved, because their inconsiderate behaviors make them feel unlovable.\nSo what is that third viable alternative to both, authoritarian and permissive adult leadership? It\u2019s what Dr. Gordon in detail describes in his model of parenting, a set of skills and methods known as Parent Effectiveness Training that are geared toward rearing self-disciplined children in a harmonious family climate.\nFor now, let\u2019s just emphasize that this new approach to relating to youngsters requires a transformation in the way adults perceive children, as well as a shift in the way they treat them. This transformation can be accomplished by learning a few new skills and methods that are applied in everyday life.\nThis newsletter will describe and examine each of these skills and methods in its future editions and hopefully contribute to you having a more harmonious and peaceful home.","id":"<urn:uuid:29c141a3-d91f-45f5-9c19-6ec27952d087>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.gordontraining.com\/free-parenting-articles\/should-i-be-a-strict-or-lenient-parent\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9550747275,"token_count":675,"score":2.71875,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Chinese researchers have turned to the light absorbing properties of butterfly wings to significantly increase the efficiency of solar hydrogen cells, using biomimetics to copy the nanostructure that allows for incredible light and heat absorption.\nButterflies are known to use heat from the sun to warm themselves beyond what their bodies can provide, and this new research takes a page from their evolution to improve hydrogen fuel generation. Analyzing the wings of Papilio helenus, the researchers found scales that are described as having:\n[...] Ridges running the length of the scale with very small holes on either side that opened up onto an underlying layer. The steep walls of the ridges help funnel light into the holes. The walls absorb longer wavelengths of light while allowing shorter wavelengths to reach a membrane below the scales. Using the images of the scales, the researchers created computer models to confirm this filtering effect. The nano-hole arrays change from wave guides for short wavelengths to barriers and absorbers for longer wavelengths, which act just like a high-pass filtering layer.\nSo, what does this have to do with fuel cells? Splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen takes energy, and is a drain on the amount you can get out of a cell. To split the water, the process uses a catalyst, and certain catalysts \u2014 say, titanium dioxide \u2014 function by exposure to light. The researchers synthesized a titanium dioxide catalyst using the pattern from the butterfly's wings, and paired it with platinum nanoparticles to make it more efficient at splitting water. The result? A 230% uptick in the amount of hydrogen produced. The structure of the butterfly's wing means that it's better at absorbing light \u2014 so who knows, you might also see the same technique on solar panels, too.","id":"<urn:uuid:9a374252-df3c-4004-8693-6678182914d9>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/io9.com\/5897144\/mimicking-butterfly-wings-could-boost-hydrogen-fuel-production","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9260504246,"token_count":355,"score":3.765625,"int_score":4}

{"text":"|Yoon Jae Kim, yj1dreamer AT gmail.com (A project report written under the guidance of Prof. Raj Jain)||Download|\nService Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a design pattern which is composed of loosely coupled, discoverable, reusable, inter-operable platform agnostic services in which each of these services follow a well defined standard. Each of these services can be bound or unbound at any time and as needed. [Jamil08]However, as defined, SOA has a loosely-coupled feature, which makes SOA open to the challenges of security. It means that SOA must meet several requirements. The main requirements are as follows[Candolin07]: service discovery, service authentication, user authentication, access control, confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy. To ensure security in a loosely-coupled SOA environment, the open standards communities that created Web services developed a number of security standards for Web services which is one of the most active and widely adopted implementation of SOA. Figure 1 depicts a notional reference model for Web services security standards. This reference model maps the different standards to the different functional layers of a typical Web service implementation.\nAs described above, in the Web Services Security Stack the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) are the standard for access control which means that when the service is requested by a user the service must enforce the specified security policy related to access control. We focus on access control in the Web Services security and represent what SAML and XACML are, how they work and where they are able to be applied together.\nSAML, created by the Security Services Technical Committee of the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS), is a an XML-based framework for communicating user authentication, entitlement, and attribute information. As its name suggests, SAML allows business entities to make assertions regarding the identity, attributes, and entitlements of a subject (an entity that is often a human user) to other entities, such as a partner company or another enterprise application. [Madsen05] SAML is a flexible and extensible protocol designed to be used - and customized if necessary - by other standards.\nWeb Single Sign-On\nIn web SSO, a user authenticates to one web site and then, without additional authentication, is able to access some personalized or customized resources at another site. SAML enables web SSO through the communication of an authentication assertion from the first site to the second which, if confident of the origin of the assertion, can choose to log in the user as if they had authenticated directly. A principal authenticates at the identity provider and is subsequently appropriately recognized (and given corresponding access\/service) at the service provider.[Google]\nFor example, Google made SAML Single Sign-On (SSO) Service for Google Apps. And Google Apps provides a SAML-based Single Sign-On (SSO) service that offers partner companies with full control over the authorization and authentication of hosted user accounts that can access web-based applications like Gmail or Google Calendar. As the service provider Google offers services as Gmail and Start Pages and partner companies control account information as identity provider.\nSimilar to the Web SSO scenario, the attribute-based authorization model has one web site communicating identity information about a subject to another web site in support of some transaction.\nHowever, the identity information may be some characteristic of the subject (such as a person's role in a B2B scenario) rather than, or in addition to, information about when and how the person was authenticated. The attribute-based authorization model is important when the individual's particular identity is either not important, should not be shared for privacy reasons, or is insufficient on its own.\nSecuring Web Services\nSAML assertions can be used within SOAP messages in order to convey security and identity information between actors in web service interactions. The SAML Token Profile produced by the OASIS Web Services Security (WSS) TC specifies how SAML assertions should be used for this purpose with the WS-Security framework. The Liberty Alliance's Identity Web Service Framework (ID-WSF) builds on these specifications to use SAML assertions for enabling secure and privacy-respecting access to web services.\nWS-Trust, one component of the private WS-* framework initiative, proposes protocols for the exchange and validation of security tokens used as described within WS-Security. SAML assertions are one such supported security token format.\nFigure 3 illustrates these actors and information flow. As can be seen in the figure, the PAP writes Polices and PolicySets and makes them available to the PDP. These Policies or PolicySets shows the complete policy for a particular target. The PEP is the component where the request is received when access requester wants to take some action on a resource and make the request. In this part, the attributes in the request may be in the format of the application environment (e.g., SAML, etc.). The PEP sends the request to the Context Handler. Context Handler maps the request and attributes to the XACML Request context and sends the request to the PDP. While evaluating the request, the PDP needs some attributes and sends the attribute queries to the Context Handler. The Context Handler collects these attributes by the help of the PIP from the resources, subjects, and the environment. After evaluation, the PDP sends the XACML Response to the Context Handler and the Context Handler translates the Response context to the native response format of the application environment and sends it to PEP. The PEP fulfills the obligations if they exist and applies the authorization decision that PDP concludes.[Periorellis07]\nA Request element contains four components as Subject, Resource, Action, and Environment. One request element has only one collection of resource and action attributes, and at most one collection of environment attributes. But there may be multiple collections of subject attributes. Subject attribute contains subject's details such as name, e-mail, role and so on. Resource attribute details the resource for which access is requested and action attribute specifies the requested action to be performed on resource such as read or wire. Also, Environment attribute is optional and contains attributes of environment.\nA Response element represents the authorization decision information made by PDP. It contains one or more Result attributes. Each result includes a Decision such as Permit, Deny, NotApplicable, or Indeterminate, some Status information which gives the errors occurred and their descriptions while evaluating the request and optionally one or more Obligations which specifies tasks in the PolicySet and Policy elements in the policy description which should be performed before granting or denying access.\nA Rule element defines the target elements to which the rule is applied and details conditions to apply the rule and has three components such as target, effect, and condition. A target element specifies the resources, subjects, actions and the environment to which the rule is applied. A condition element shows the conditions to apply the rule and a effect is the consequence of the rule as either permit or deny.\nA policy is the set of rules which are combined with some algorithms. These algorithms are called Rule-combining algorithms. For instance \"Permit Override\" algorithm allows the policy to evaluate to \"Permit\" if any rule in the policy evaluates to \"Permit\". A policy also contains target elements which shows the subjects, resources, actions, environment that policy is applied.\nA PolicySet consists of Policies and PolicySets combined with policy-combined algorithm. It has also target like a Policy.\nThe XACML context shows how flexible and suitable the XACML is for various application. This feature makes it possible that XACML is applied to access control system with SAML. Section 4 shows the more detailed.\nSAML is one standard suitable for providing the assertion and protocol mechanisms and specifies schemas for carrying the security and authorization related information and have the bindings to basic transportation mechanisms. Therefore, OASIS publishes a SAML profile for the XACML (OASIS, 2005)[Anderson05] to carry the XACML messages between the XACML actors. This profile defines the usage of SAML 2.0 to protect, store, transport, request and respond with XACML instances and other information. It contains largely four categories.\nFirst, this profile specifies how to use SAML Attributes in an XACML system. This category contains three standard SAML elements such as SAML Attribute, SAML AttributeStatement and SAML Assertion, two standard SAML protocol such as SAML AttributeQuery and SAML Response, and one new SAML extension element, XACMLAssertion. In an XACML system, SAML Attribute may be used to store and to transmit attribute values and must be transformed into an XACML Attribute before used in an XACML Request Context. Also SAML AttributeStatement may be used to hold SAML Attribute instances. A SAML Assertion may be used to hold SAML AttributeStatement instances in an XACML system, either in an Attribute Repository or in a SAML Response to a SAML AttributeQuery. To transform a SAML Attribute into an XACML Attribute the SAML Assertion includes information that is required and a SAML Assertion or an XACMLAssertion instance contains a SAML Attribute. An XACMLAssertion is an alternative to the SAML Assertion and allows inclusion of XACML Statement instances and inclusion of other XACMLAssertion instance as advice. An XACML PDP or PEP use SAML AttributeQuery to request SAML Attribute instances from an Attribute Authority for use in an XACML Request Context and in response to it SAML Response shall be used to return SAML Attribute instances.\nSecond, this profile represent the use of SAML for use in requesting, responding with, storing, and transmitting authorization decisions in an XACML system. This category contains XACMLAuthzDecisionStatement, XACMLAssertion, XACMLAuthzDecisionQuery, and XACMLResponse. In this profile, XACMLAuthzDecisionStatement and XACMLAssertion are new SAML extension elements and the others are new SAML extension protocol elements. In an XACML system, XACMLAuthzDecisionSatement may be used to contain XACML authorization decisions for storage or transmission and XACMLAssertion may be used to contain XACMLAuthzDecisionStatement instances for storage or transmission. Also a PEP may use XACMLAuthzDecisionQuery to request an authorization decision from an XACML PDP and an XACML PDP may use XACMLResponse to return authorization decisions in response to an XACMLAuthzDecisionQuery.\nThen, this profile shows the use of SAML for use in requesting, responding with, storing and transmitting XACML policies. This category includes four new SAML extensions; XACMLPolicyStatement, XACMLAssertion, XACMLPolicyQuery and XACMLResponse. In an XACML system, XACMLPolicyStatement may hold XACML policies for storage or transmission and XACMLAssertion may hold XACMLPolicySatement instances for storage or transmission. And a PDP or other application uses XACMLPolicyQuery to request XACML from a PAP. Also PAP uses XACMLResponse to return policies in response to an XACMLPolicyQuery.\nFinally, this profile details the use of XACMLAssertion instances as advice in other Assertion. This category consists of XACML Advice, which is a new SAML extension element in this profile that may be used for including XACMLAssertion instances as advice in another XACMLAssertion, and XACMLAssertion which is a new SAML extension element that may be used to hold on XACMLAdvice instance along with SAML Statement or XACML extension Statement instance.\nFigure 5 describes the XACML use model and the messages that can be used to communicate between the various components. Statements are carried in SAML or XACML Assertions, and Assertions are carried in SAML or XACML Responses. Not all components or messages will be used in every implementation. Next subsection shows the practical example of this model.\nThe steps of communication between Portal and Web services are described in detail as follows:\nFocusing on access control we represent SAML and XACML which are developed by OASIS. SAML is an XML-based framework for exchanging authentication and authorization data. Because SAML has much strength such as platform neutrality, loose coupling of directories, improved online experience for end user, reduced administrative costs for service providers and risk transference. Also SAML is being applied in Web Single Sign-On, Attribute-Based Authorization, and Securing Web Services.\nXACML defines XML files which contains access control policy and access control decision request\/ response. Policy Decision Point (PDP) looks at the request from Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) and finds some policy applying to the request from Policy Administration Point (PAP) and returns the response about whether access should be granted to PEP.\nXACML defines the content of Request\/Response messages but does not define protocols or transport mechanisms, which SAML provides by defining schemas for use in requesting and responding with various types of security assertions. This SAML\/XACML based access control is a very powerful and practical solution for dynamic and large-scale application domain because it is easier to change and maintain policies.

{"text":"Hydrocele Operation: aka Hydroceles, Hydrocele Sac, Swollen Testicle, Hydrocelectomy\nWhat is it?\nHydrocele operations or hydrocele surgery is to release fluid that forms in a sac within the scrotum. Typically hydroceles develop when the testicle passes into the scrotum but the passage through which this occur fails to close properly. Fluid can accumulate in this passage from the abdomen, and then enters the scrotum causing it to swell.\nThis can cause one or both sides of the scrotum to swell and the testicle itself to swell or become damage and inflamed. Fluid can also block the tube where sperm typically flow from. Hydroceles are more common in newborn boys but are not exclusive to newborn boys. To diagnose a hydrocele typically a doctor will look for swelling in the scrotum caused primarily by fluid build up or will look for something solid like a fluid-filled sac in the scrotum.\nTypically fluid is removed from the hydrocele sac during a procedure called a hydrocelectomy. For the most part this is a straightforward and uncomplicated procedure that may produce a moderate amount of soreness for a few days following the procedure. The long-term benefits far outweigh any short-term soreness.\nMany times the patient is a young patient under the age of 10 or in many cases a newborn baby that is born with a hydrocele defect. Usually a surgery takes placed under general anesthesia. A surgeon will make a small incision in the scrotum that will allow fluid to be drained from the scrotum and then seal the passage from the scrotum to the abdomen. Usually the incision is then closed with stitches that will dissolve on their own so they do not have to be removed later.\nAlternatives to Surgery\nThere are no known alternatives to this surgery currently.\nBefore the Operation\nPrior to the operation the doctor will confirm a fluid filled sac exists by placing a light to the scrotum which will light up the testicles, veins in the scrotum and the fluid filled sac which will appear clear to the light.\nA doctor will also perform a comprehensive medical history and check any medications the patient is currently taking. Patients are advised not to eat or drink anything up to 12 hours before the procedure because it is performed under general anesthesia.\nAfter the Operation- At Home\nOnce the operation is complete the patient will recover usually for a few hours in a day bed. The procedure is usually performed on an outpatient basis meaning the patient can usually go home on the same day. Most of the time it is best to wear looser fitting close that will prevent irritation and discomfort on leaving.\nThere are some risks associated with this procedure as there are with any procedure including a small risk of infection. Other risks including the risk of bleeding during or after the procedure, and a risk of a blood clot forming in the area of the procedure. The doctor may accidentally damage the scrotum or the tissues surrounding this area too.\nAnytime a patient undergoes general anesthesia there are risks associated with this too including a risk of pneumonia following surgery. The nurse or doctor will encourage the patient to take deep breaths to clear the lungs following surgery. Many people especially younger children undergoing this operation may report feeling nauseous or dizzy following the procedure, a side effect largely associated with the general anesthesia. These complications are usually temporary however and resolve within a couple of days of treatment.\nA hydrocele procedure is generally performed to relieve fluid build up around the testicle or within the scrotum. This procedure is relatively simple with few complications. The primary risks include a risk of infection and risk of rupture or nicks to nearby tissues or structures. If you work with a competent health professional you reduce your odds of complications.\nBecause these surgeries are often performed on younger individuals it pays to ask someone if they have experience working on youths or pediatric patients. You may need to pay a small amount extra to work with someone that specializes in pediatrics or even geriatrics if you are over 50 or 60 and have a fluid-filled sac in the scrotum that you require surgery for. Regardless of where you go or who you see make sure they practice safe hygiene practices to ensure your safety and wellness.\nEstimated Costs for Hydrocele Operation\nThe cost of surgery varies widely and may depend partly on the patient\u2019s age and overall health and wellness. Patients that do not require extensive health accommodations or hospital stays are likely to have to pay the least in adjunctive healthcare therapy. That said you should always be prepared to foot the bill for extra expenses including any complications that may rise from treatment. Health insurance may offset some of these costs.\nKeep in mind there may be separate fees associated with anesthesia. The hospital and anesthesia fees are usually separate from the fees charged for the procedure itself, although some medical tourism companies tend to provide all-inclusive packages for their patients. This may be the best option for individuals that plan to travel abroad already and want to fit in a little health care while traveling for pleasure.\n|Country||Costs Hydrocele Operation|","id":"<urn:uuid:57d92190-6ad1-4d8c-aca4-713307cec119>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/medicaltourismguide.com\/procedures\/medical\/hydrocele-operation\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9437116981,"token_count":1049,"score":2.84375,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Tell me about the International Dark-Sky Association\u2014how did it start, what's the mission?\nIDA\u2019s mission is to preserve and protect the nighttime environment and our heritage of dark skies through environmentally responsible outdoor lighting. IDA was founded in 1988 by a professional astronomer working at the Kitt Peak Observatory in Tucson, Arizona and an amateur astronomer who noticed that the increasing sky glow over Tucson was interfering with nighttime observations. Their message is simple, clear, and effective, and their efforts were fundamental in getting light pollution recognized around the world as an unwelcome and detrimental environmental condition.\nWhat are some of the effects of light pollution on animals? On humans? Tell me about some of the science that supports this.\nThere are four main types of light pollution: sky glow (that strange orange dome over urban areas), glare (overly bright, unshielded points of light), light trespass (unwanted light intruding onto private property), and clutter (groupings of light sources). Animals and even plants are affected by sky glow and light trespass due to their extreme photosensitivity. Because seasonal temperatures can vary from year to year, many species rely on light cues to tell them when to shed leaves, mate, and reproduce. When outdoor lighting artificially prolongs the day, the instinctive rhythms of many species are affected.\nMany species behave unnaturally in the presence of artificial light\u2014for example, light at night decreases a firefly\u2019s ability to be seen, thereby hindering its ability to attract a mate. Sea turtles and migratory birds use starlight to orient themselves, so light pollution has devastated their internal navigation systems. Some birds will crash into tall buildings, or fixate on a light source, circling around it until they are exhausted and unable to fly.\nGlare from unshielded light sources presents the largest problem to humans. Effects of glare from poor outdoor lighting are a primary reason that the American Medical Association unanimously adopted Resolution 516 to support light pollution and glare reduction efforts last June. Depending on the severity, glare can cause discomfort or temporary night blindness. On the roadway, glares can interfere with visibility, presenting a hazard to both drivers and pedestrians. The problem gets worse as people age and gradually lose their ability to adjust to changing light levels.\nExposure to excessive light at night has been found to alter the circadian rhythm, interfere with sleep patterns, and suppress the sleep hormone melatonin. The amount of light needed to affect sleep patterns is not known, but sleeping in total darkness is recommended by both the CDC and the NIH as a way to promote a regular circadian rhythm.\nWhat is International Dark-Sky Association doing to combat light pollution? How are you measuring the effectiveness of these campaigns?\nAs an environmental educational 501(c)(3) non-profit, IDA has enacted dynamic programs in the areas of technology, conservation, and public awareness. IDA\u2019s Fixture Seal of Approval program directly attacks sky glow by establishing \u201cdark sky-friendly\u201d criteria for outdoor light fixtures.\nCurrently in the spotlight is our International Dark Sky Places (IDSPlaces) program, a conservation curriculum established to protect urban and rural starscapes. The IDS Communities and Dark Sky Developments of Distinction designations recognize outstanding dark sky preservation efforts in municipalities and planned communities. All designated IDSPlaces have met stringent lighting requirements through retrofits and legislation and have undertaken outreach efforts to educate the public about the importance of natural night. Many designees are successfully incorporating astronomy and stargazing into their local attractions, hosting festivals or sky watching events known as \u201cstar parties.\u201d\nIn house, IDA collects, creates, and distributes information relating to light pollution, much of which is available for free on the IDA website. We also participate in industry meetings and technology expos, and actively collaborate with non-profit interest groups.\nDo you see differences regionally? How bad is the East Coast in terms of light pollution?\nSeveral New England states have taken great strides to protect their skies. The east coast has more light on the whole simply because it is more densely populated, not because the lighting is necessarily worse. We don\u2019t see a huge difference regionally so much as from city to city. Rural and urban areas across the world have enacted dark sky ordinances or are undertaking retrofits in public lighting (usually as part of an energy saving endeavor) and their lighting is much more thoughtful, more aesthetically pleasing, and more efficient than cities or townships that have not.\nWhat can you tell me about any legislation concerning light pollution, particularly on the East Coast? In New York? IDA\u2019s newly opened public policy office in Washington, DC is creating a lot of opportunities for collaboration with other non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and some significant inroads with energy agencies and congressional leaders, but any national action is a long way off. Many of these accomplishments have been spurred by Leo Smith, IDA\u2019s Regional Director for New England Sections. Connecticut is the furthest along in terms of addressing light pollution, with three state laws, one state building code requirement, and one requirement from the utility regulators to present a new streetlight rate for streetlights that are programmed to turn off at midnight are on the books.\nThe New Hampshire law, signed in July, also requires utility regulators to adopt a rate for streetlights that are turned off at midnight, as well as requiring shielded streetlights. Maine and Rhode Island both require shielded streetlights. New York isn\u2019t quite there yet, though night lighting has been addressed in several regions, namely the municipalities of Tully, East Hampton, Southampton, Tuxedo Park, Riverhead, and Brookhaven.\nIDA conducts third-party certification of light fixtures\u2014 how successful has this program been, how many certified fixtures are currently on the market and how receptive has the industry been to change?\nIDA has reached out to the lighting industry since its inception. Good quality light at night is necessary for safety, security, and recreation, but outdoor light is the main cause of light pollution. Some members of the lighting community have been very apt to address this, and have worked to create products that minimize light pollution by directing light to the ground, where it is needed, instead of to the sky, where it becomes a wasteful nuisance. IDA is fortunate to have support from these companies, because they provide the technology to make our mission effective.\nThe Fixture Seal of Approval program was started in 2005 to recognize lighting manufacturers who integrated the concept of full shielding into their fixture design and to encourage market expansion of dark sky-friendly products. Any approved fixture must be fully shielded to emit no light above a 90 degree angle. This program has been wildly successful for both IDA and the lighting manufacturers who join. The IDA seal is gaining worldwide recognition and becoming a selling point for manufacturers and vendors alike, and the market for dark sky-friendly products is expanding as companies strive to design sleek, stylish, and efficient fixtures. Over 100 manufacturers have joined the FSA program to date, featuring approximately 300 fixture models.\nWhat can consumers do to combat light pollution? And then, what can architects, builders, planners do to combat light pollution?\nShield your light sources, especially floodlights. A \u201cpar shield\u201d that clips on to the fixture makes a huge difference in directing light where you want it to go. If you install dark sky-friendly fixtures outside your home or business, you\u2019ve already made a difference. Look for the IDA Fixture Seal of Approval or purchase a fully-shielded or full-cutoff product. Those who want to learn more or work toward creating an ordinance can join a local IDA Section (information at darksky.org) or contact a local astronomy club.\nArchitects and builders interested in sustainability can achieve LEED Credit 8, which specifically addresses outdoor lighting. Again, purchasing and installing fully shielded fixtures in any new development is all it takes. The market now contains so many qualified fixtures that there is virtually no difference in price.\nLight sent into the sky costs the U.S. approximately $2.2 billion every year. As energy efficiency becomes imperative, city planners must consider improvements in public lighting as a long term way to reduce energy and conserve public funds. Most streets can dramatically lessen their lighting without compromising driver response time or pedestrian safety.\nIn your view, what's the most compelling reason for consumers to swap their traditional outdoor lighting to a Dark Sky fixture, and how are you getting that message out?\nThe dark skies movement will resonate with anyone who recognizes the profound effect light has on a space, indoor or outdoor. Seriously, what other small change can you make that affects wildlife, energy, and the ambiance of your entire neighborhood? In addition to the personal benefits you receive in terms of reduced energy use and a more pleasant personal space, a shift to dark sky-friendly lighting shows an awareness of the environment at large and a respect for the place you live.\nThe dark sky message usually sells itself, once people become aware of it. IDA\u2019s wonderful volunteers do a phenomenal job in spreading enthusiasm for the cause. Their interest in creating a sustainable, beautiful nighttime environment and their dedication to action is what drives the success this campaign. Thanks to the hard work of IDA volunteers worldwide, cities in the Americas, Europe, Asia, and even Australia are seeing the darkness.\nFor more information about the IDA, local policies, and where to find shielded lighting, visit darksky.org","id":"<urn:uuid:23364f66-83aa-43c7-b0fd-cb8825f1b6f8>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.upstatehouse.com\/view\/full_story\/4976834\/article-Exclusive-Q-A-with-Rowena-Davis-","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9494374394,"token_count":1950,"score":3.625,"int_score":4}
{"text":"Octodon degus is generally considered endemic to west central Chile, where it inhabits the lower slopes of the Andes. Although some have argued that its range may extend north into Peru, this is not well supported. It is common in the international pet trade, however, and is often used in laboratory studies outside of its native range. (Contreras, et al., 1987; Woods and Boraker, 1975)\nOctodon degus inhabits a mediterranean-type semi-arid shrubland ecosystem called \"matorral\", which is found on the western slopes of the Andes between 28 and 35 degrees south latitude. Further north the climate becomes too arid to support this plant community, and further south it is too wet. Degus appear to be limited to elevations below 1200 meters, both by the distribution of their habitat and by their intolerance of low oxygen partial pressure. Degus are well able to inhabit lands influenced by cattle grazing, and are agricultural pests in some areas. (Contreras, et al., 1987; Fulk, 1976)\nOctodon degus superficially resembles a gerbil, but is much larger. Degus typically weigh between 170 and 300 g, and measure between 325 and 440 mm in length, including the tail. The fur is yellow-brown on the back and head, and the underparts and feet are cream colored. There is a pale band around the eye and, in some individuals, the neck. The tail is moderately long and conspicuously tufted. The ears are large and darkly pigmented. The fifth digit is reduced, and on the forefeet it has a nail instead of a claw. The cheekteeth are hypsodont and their biting surfaces resemble a figure of eight. Sexes are difficult to distinguish, but males tend to be about 10% larger than females. Pups are born furred and able to see, and begin exploring within hours of birth. Octodon degus can be distinguished from the two other members of the genus Octodon by slight differences in dental morphology. It is also smaller than its relatives and its tail is said to be more noticeably tufted. (Fulk, 1976; Lee, 2004)\nDuring the annual breeding season, male-male aggression temporarily increases. Males exclude other males from their burrow and monopolize the females (usually 2 to 4) who live there. Dustbathing and urine marking may be used in the defense of territory by both sexes, but these behaviors particularly increase in the male during the breeding season. Courting males often engage in mutual grooming with females, and frequently perform a courtship ritual which involves wagging of the tail and trembling of the body. The male then raises a hind leg and sprays urine onto the female. This may serve to familiarize her with his scent and perhaps make her more receptive to his advances in the future. Receptive females may sometimes enurinate males in a similar fashion. Related female degus may nurse each other's young. (Ebensperger and Caiozzi, 2002; Fulk, 1976; Kleiman, 1974; Soto-Gamboa, 2005)\nIn the wild degus tend to breed once per year. The breeding season usually begins in late May (autumn in Chile), and the young are conceived in late winter to early spring (September to October). In wet years, degus may produce second litters. It has been suggested that degus may be induced ovulators, but this has not been established for certain. There is also some evidence that male reproductive organs may be sensitive to changes in photoperiod. The gestation period is 90 days, and litter size is typically 4-6 pups. The young are precocial. They are born with fur and teeth; their eyes are open and they are able to move about the nest on their own. Pups are weaned at 4 to 5 weeks, and become sexually mature between 12 and 16 weeks of age. Degus do not reach adult size until about 6 months of age, however, and they generally live in same-sex social groups until they are about 9 months old and their first breeding season occurs. It has been reported that pups raised in isolation in the laboratory experience severe neural and behavioral abnormalities. (Ebensperger and Hurtado, 2005; Lee, 2004; Woods and Boraker, 1975)\nBefore conception can occur, the male degu must invest considerable energy in the defense of his territory and harem from other males. The female subsequently expends considerable energy in gestation and lactation. The pregnancy is relatively long for a rodent, and the young are born well developed. After birth, both parents protect and provision the pups. Degus nest communally, and groups of related females nurse one another's young. In the laboratory, the female remains close to the pups until two weeks after birth, and males have been observed to huddle with the young during this period without instances of infanticide. In the wild, male degus may spend as much time feeding and huddling with the young as females do. Pups begin to eat solid food at about two weeks of age, and venture out of the burrow at three weeks. Upon weaning at four to six weeks, the pups are able to live independently of the parents and form same-sex social groups until their first breeding season. (Ebensperger and Hurtado, 2005; Fulk, 1976; Lee, 2004; Woods and Boraker, 1975)\nIn laboratory conditions, degus typically live five to eight years.\nDegus are social and tend to live in groups of one to two males and two to five related females. Females participate in rearing on another's young. Groups maintain territories throughout much of the year. Degus are semi-fossorial, digging extensive communal burrow systems. These burrows are often shared by Bennett's chinchilla rat (Abrocoma bennettii). Degus feed exclusively above ground, however, and have been observed climbing into the low branches of shrubs while foraging. Dustbathing is an important social behavior among degus. Groups repeatedly mark favorite wallows with urine and anal gland secretions. This may help the group identify each other by scent as well as delineating territorial boundaries. Degus are mainly diurnal, and are most active during the morning and evening. (Ebensperger, et al., 2004; Fulk, 1976; Woods and Boraker, 1975)\nFulk (1976) estimated that social groups of degus occupy home areas of roughly 200 square meters, and that their density is about 75 degus per hectare. This may be an underestimate, however, due to the trapping methods used. (Fulk, 1976)\nDegus have well-developed sight, smell, and hearing. They are highly vocal and use various calls to communicate with one another, including alarm calls, mating calls, and communication between parents and young. Vision is very important in avoidance of predators and in foraging. It has been shown that degus are able to see ultraviolet wavelengths, and that their urine reflects in the UV range when fresh. It has therefore been suggested that degus' urine scent marks are also visual cues. These scent marks are also used as dust wallows, allowing members of a social group to identify each other by scent. (Chavez, et al., 2003; Fulk, 1976; Woods and Boraker, 1975)\nDegus are generalist herbivores. They feed on the leaves, bark, and seeds of shrubs and forbs. Among their favorite foods are the bark of Cestrum palqui and Mimosa cavenia, leaves and bark of Proustia cuneifolia, Atriplex repunda, and Acacia caven, annuals such as Erodium cicutarum when in season, green grasses, and thistle seeds. Degus choose food items that reduce fiber and increase nitrogen and moisture in the diet, and thus prefer young leaves and avoid woodier shrubs. Degus rely on microbial fermentation in their enlarged cecum (they are \"hindgut fermenters\") to digest their food. They reingest a large percentage of their feces, usually during the night. This allows them to maximize their digestion. Degus store food in the winter, and it has been reported that they occasionally eat meat in old age. (Gutierrez and Bozinovic, 1998; Kenagy, et al., 1999; Veloso and Kenagy, 2005; Woods and Boraker, 1975)\nOctodon degus is subject to predation by larger mammals such as culpeo foxes (Lycalopex culpaeus), and from the air by raptors such as barn owls (Tyto alba), short-eared owls (Asio flammeus), and black-chested buzzard eagles (Geranoaetus melanoleucus). Degus use vigilance and cover to avoid predators. Their pelage is also counter-shaded and matches the soil color, which reduces visibility to predators. Degus live socially and use alarm calls to warn others of danger. When a predator is spotted, they take cover in shrubby areas and may retreat to the communal burrow. (Ebensperger and Wallem, 2002; Woods and Boraker, 1975)\nOctodon degus affects the plant community in its habitat by selective browsing. Degus behaviorally reduce the fiber content of their diet, preferrentially eating shrubs such as Adesmia bedwellii, Baccharis paniculata, and Chenopodium petioare, which are less fibrous and less thorny than others. These species have been shown to increase their foliage area upon exclusion of degus. As degus are very common, they are themselves an important food source for their predators. (Gutierrez and Bozinovic, 1998)\nDegus often live in association with Bennett's chinchilla rats (Abrocoma bennettii). The two species are known to share burrow systems and have even been observed in the same chamber within a burrow. This is believed to be a mutualistic relationship, but it is not well understood. (Fulk, 1976; Woods and Boraker, 1975)\nDegus are frequently kept as pets, and are used extensively in laboratory research. Because they are largely diurnal, they are useful in research on circadian rhythms, and their intolerance of sugars makes them ideal models for diabetes research. (Lee, 2004)\nDegus are significant agricultural pests in some areas. They take advantage of cultivated prickly pear cactus, wheat, vineyards, and orchards as abundant food sources, and can do considerable damage. They are also known to host three species of parasites that can infect humans.

{"text":"What does the term \"Flawed Democracy\" actually mean?\nWhy are some of the world's successful democracies like France, Israel and India rated \"Flawed Democracies\" by the Economist Intelligence Unit?\nFirst off the wikipedia page that you cite to is based on the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index (\"EIUDI\") which is not an academic source. The methodology used to assemble the report is not known, but that doesn't mean that it is not useful.\nWith that in mind from the EIUDI 2011 Report:\nThe EIUDI report uses five criteria to measure a country's democracy:\nThe countries that you are interested in scored as follows for these five categories:\nFrance: France scores relatively low on \"Functioning of government,\" \"Political participation,\" and \"Political culture.\"\nIsrael: Israel scores pretty bad on \"Civil liberties,\" and sort of mediocre on everything else.\nIndia: India scores bad on both \"Political participation,\" and \"Political culture.\"\nSo these countries have good governments, but there are certain issues typically related to the political culture that bring their overall score down and make them flawed democracies according to the index.\n|show 2 more comments|\nDemocracy, in this index in particular, mostly refers to participation in the governments system of elections. Not electioneering, laws or even policies that could inherently discriminate. It is a weak index and is only useful for investors looking for a predictable government to trade with, or to entrench a western cultural world view. Its virtually guaranteed that foreign exchange controls and this index are highly correlated.\nBesides the methodology of collecting information being scientifically unsound, this is not an indicator of human rights, discrimination in the public space, respect for international law or even outright racist laws and policies. These can all be violated \"democratically\". But then again, this is the Economist, which has proven repeatedly to present a highly neo-liberal bias in it's political commentary (white-male-westerners will likely disagree).\nNot a good index, not representative of the reality of the world.\nCivil rights: The most important thing in a democracy is human and civil rights, as well as the rule of the law (ie not arbitrary decisions). With the Indefinite Detention Act voted in the USA, plus Guantanamo, non respect for international laws, drones strikes, the enforced role of the military in the civilian sector, police brutality... and so much more, the USA is way down in the rank of democracies.\nPolitical culture: This is set upside down, a ridiculous way of evaluation. France gives exposure to all presidential as well as house representatives candidates: equal time to speak on TV, equal exposure in all aspects during the weeks before the elections. And that's how you can promote knowledge and awareness, which is culture. It is not at all this way in America. On the contrary, the US people are stuck with their two political parties system that represents the rich and powerful elite only, those capable of paying to be heard and known by the public. \"Culture\" in the US is only available on given topics, the point of views of the rich and interests of big business only. This only promotes ignorance. Actually, the USA is not democracy, it's plutocracy. It does not deserve a high rank. It has one of the lowest and most backwards political culture and system in the Western world, belonging to the beginning of the 20th century, no longer to the 21rst.\nCorruption should be a major criterion to include in the index. There, France ranks very low. So does the USA.\nFreedom of press is an aspect, but the actual representation of a greater diversity of points of views from all sides should be the criterion to include in the index. That's the means and obstructions to freedom of expression. It is huge in the USA with over 85% of all news coming out of 5 corporations linked to the CIA, defense conglomerate and corporate interests in general.\nAnd much more.","id":"<urn:uuid:ff23bc37-bfb7-4d69-85ba-d80f191bef1c>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/history.stackexchange.com\/questions\/1825\/why-are-the-democracies-of-france-israel-and-india-rated-flawed-democracies","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9536606669,"token_count":820,"score":2.703125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"- Coming Soon.\nmaster naturalist for teachers\nThe Teacher\u2019s Master Naturalist program incorporates best practices for systemic school reform - it requires that the school\u2019s principal initiate the partnership, and that each school send a team of lead teachers who are responsible for implementing their school\u2019s science and math programs. LCI adapted its Master Naturalist curriculum to provide a program that teaches teachers how to use experiential learning most effectively to improve their school\u2019s science and math programs. Participants engage in research and educational experiences designed to empower them to teach from a first person perspective, sharing their personal adventures with their classes.\nDuring workshops, teachers set and check traps for fish, reptiles, and amphibians, conduct flora and fauna surveys, and collect and identify marine invertebrates and other organisms. As teams of teachers graduate from the course they continue to receive support for school-based projects from LCI staff and the local Master Naturalist association. The program began in 2007-2008 with two pilot schools, and has expanded to eight schools during the 2009-2010 school year. Teachers receive Master Naturalist certification and continuing education credit after completing the year-long program.\nlearning expeditions schools\nThe goal of the Learning Expeditions Schools program is to use environmental science as a theme to integrate learning about science, social studies, math, and language arts. The program is a partnership between the LowCountry Institute, Clemson University's Youth Learning Institute, and Beaufort County Schools. The interdisciplinary lessons include field trips, virtual field trips using video and PowerPoint programs, and hands-on activities in the classroom. These lessons use science standards to teach students how geography and climate determine plant communities present which, in turn, influence the economy and the history of the region. Math is integrated into all lessons through science and history-based word problems.\nPilot schools for this program are Shell Point Elementary, Shanklin Elementary, and Robert Smalls Middle School. During the 2012-2013 school year, the program will be made available to other district schools that wish to participate.\n- Grants: Several schools have been recipients of grants from LCI to create outdoor classrooms and natural areas using native plants to teach students about pollination, plant lifecycles, and native habitats.\n- Hands-on programs: LCI staff and volunteers conduct programs at schools to teach students about the plants and animals native to the Port Royal Sound System.\n- School field trips: LCI is able to invite a limited number of schools each year to participate in field trips on Spring Island where students learn about habitats and animals of the lowcountry.\nclick image to see photos of our school programs","id":"<urn:uuid:203080f7-b3cf-446a-b1d2-64c1f4de18d8>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.lowcountryinstitute.org\/what-we-do\/school-programs","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9407625198,"token_count":543,"score":2.75,"int_score":3}

{"text":"This is outstanding, but how does the cerebrospinal fluid stop the brain receiving harmful pathogens in the same way that the blood would? Any answers welcome, I'm just interested!\nImage courtesy J. Iliff and M. Nedergaard, AAAS\nGreen tracer molecules drift through cerebrospinal fluid crowding around a blood vessel. Image courtesy J. Iliff and M. Nedergaard, AAAS\nPublished August 16, 2012\nTalk about brainwashing\u2014a newfound plumbing system, identified in mice, likely helps the brain empty its waste, a new study says. Because mouse biology is similar to ours, the same findings should apply to people too, experts say.\nThanks to a blood-brain barrier\u2014a natural wall that protects the brain tissue\u2014the organ never touches blood, thus protecting it from microbes, viruses, and other pathogens.\nTo get nutrients to brain tissue and remove its waste, the brain makes a liquid called cerebrospinal fluid. But exactly how the fluid removes gunk generated by brain cells wasn't certain until now.\nWatch a video explaining the newfound plumbing system.\nExperiments in the 1950s and '60s hinted that diffusion\u2014the passive method by which, say, food coloring spreads out in a glass of water\u2014moved cerebrospinal fluid around the brain.\nYet this process is too slow to explain the brain's lightning-fast activity and immaculate cleanliness.\nIt turns out that, while studying brain tissue, the researchers in the 1950s and '60s unwittingly turned off the plumbing that washes the tissue.\n\"The idea of a cleaning system based on pressure has been around for a long time, but if you open the skull anywhere, like a hydraulic pump, it stops. They thought [the cleaning system] didn't exist,\" said study leader Maiken Nedergaard, a neuroscientist at the University of Rochester Medical Center.\nThe pump system is \"on the order of a thousand times faster than diffusion,\" she said. \"I'm surprised that no one had discovered this until now.\"\nBrain Under Pressure\nNedergaard and her colleagues dubbed the newfound plumbing the glymphatic system, after neural tissue called glial cells, which power the flow of cerebrospinal fluid.\nGlial cells do this by growing their \"feet\" around vessels and veins that carry blood, forming a sort of pipe around a pipe.\nTiny pores in this outer pipe then suck nutrient-rich cerebrospinal fluid from the blood vessels into channels dense with nerve cells, and pores at other locations pump the fluid out. The process simultaneously carries away the brain's waste while feeding its cells.\nNedergaard and her team used a special two-photon microscope, whose infrared light allows a deep, clear look into living brain tissue without harming it.\n\"These microscopes are revolutionizing neuroscience, and they've only become commercially available in the past five or six years,\" Nedergaard said.\nStudying living mouse brains required opening their skulls. Yet unlike in previous experiments, the researchers sealed each hole with a tiny glass plate, keeping the fluid pressure while providing a window for the microscope.\nFluorescent dyes injected into the mouse brains then allowed the team to record movies of the cerebrospinal fluid moving through brain tissue.\n\"The fact we could look at it and make a movie was very important to showing the flow,\" Nedergaard said.\n(See brain pictures.)\nBrain Study Makes Scientist's \"Heart Sing\"\nClinical neuroscientist Bruce Ransom, who studies glial cells but was not involved in the study, said the work makes his \"heart sing.\"\n\"It wasn't impossible to imagine that cerebrospinal fluid moves with enough force to be a garbage-disposal system, but that was always speculative,\" said Ransom, of the University of Washington in Seattle.\n\"This team, however, has done something very clever to find this system: demonstrate how it works and show it can vigorously wash away waste.\"\nNow that the plumbing has been found, study leader Nedergaard and her colleagues are exploring its implications. A big one may be in its role in Alzheimer's disease, which is thought to arise when brain cells are killed by the accumulation of a protein waste called beta-amyloid.\n\"Next we need to move beyond mice,\" Nedergaard said. \"We need to see if this same system exists in humans\u2014which I suspect it does.\"\nThe study of the brain's plumbing system was published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\nThese six scientists were snubbed for awards or robbed of credit for discoveries \u2026 because they were women.\nSweden needs garbage to maintain its energy habits, so it\u2019s begun importing trash\u2014just over 881,000 tons\u2014from nearby Norway to do it.\nA boulder-size meteor slammed into the moon in March, igniting an explosion so bright that anyone looking up at right moment might have spotted it.","id":"<urn:uuid:53b01003-7a03-46bd-a8b2-c29887001e66>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/news.nationalgeographic.com\/news\/2012\/08\/120816-brains-health-science-cleaning-body\/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ng%2FNews%2FNews_Main+%28National+Geographic+News+-+Main%29","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.954069972,"token_count":1033,"score":3.4375,"int_score":3}
{"text":"In the summer of 1892, Porter Nye and his family set up a homestead on the south shore of Lake Bemidji.\nThe area was the last territory in Minnesota to be opened for settlement, and the logging boom was just beginning.\nAccording to local lore, Nye used some of the first boards produced by a mill on the Mississippi River between Lake Bemidji and Lake Irving to build a small schoolhouse on his homestead. Nye also was the first teacher at the school.\nIn 1902, J. Custer Moore teamed up with Nye to plat the 16-block town site of Nye-Moore, which evolved to Nyemore and, now, Nymore. The next year, residents of the village of Nymore passed a bond issue to build a wood frame school at the corner of Fifth Street and Lincoln Avenue Southeast. The community named the school after President Abraham Lincoln.\nAlso operating in Nymore was the four-grade East School on the current site of Lincoln Elementary School at 1617 Fifth St. N.E.\nLand speculation took off after 1910 and the original Lincoln School became overcrowded. School taxes also were inadequate to maintain the building. Lincoln School was condemned by the State Department of Education, and on March 5, 1916, the Nymore Village Council petitioned the Bemidji City Council for annexation and school consolidation.\nIt was noted in the Bemidji Daily Pioneer that women voted in the Nymore annexation and school consolidation referendum held later that month. An April 19, 1916, article in the Pioneer stated: \"With the annexation of Nymore, a new school will be necessary. A new building will cost about $50,000.\"\nStudents started the fall 1917 semester in the new brick school at Fifth Street and Lincoln Avenue. The building is now home to Mount Zion Church.\nWith the consolidation of the school districts, Bemidji also supplied Nymore with a 14-passenger bus to transport students.\nIn 1995, Bemidji School District voters approved construction of the new Lincoln Elementary School. Site work began in 1997, and students moved in in October 1999.\nOn July 3, 1999, the school district held a farewell open house at the 1917 building. About 1,000 current and former students, faculty and staff participated. They toured classrooms and viewed artifacts from the school's collection.\nA special artifact, the portrait of President Lincoln originally hung in 1924 in the hallway at the 414 Lincoln Ave. S.E. school, moved with the students into the current Lincoln Elementary School. He now looks down on continuing generations of Lincoln Lakers in the school lobby.\nLooking to the future, Lincoln Principal Tom Kusler said he expects the school population of about 500 students to remain steady, or even modestly increase.\n\"We're still able to maintain the same number of sections,\" he said.\nThere are 37 teachers and 21 classrooms at Lincoln.\nThe big changes will be in technology, he said. This year, three fifth-grade teachers began using electronic SMART Boards in a pilot project.\n\"We have 19 teachers that are getting SMART Boards now,\" he said.\nKusler said the purchases will come from the federal Title I funds, not the Bemidji School District budget.\n\"I think technologies are what we're going to be getting into more and more down the road,\" he said.\nInformation for this article came from \"Celebrating Lincoln School,\" a Lincoln School History Project, and the Beltrami County Historical Society archives.","id":"<urn:uuid:522544c2-bab7-48eb-b0e9-ec4675913ee2>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.bemidjipioneer.com\/content\/lincoln-school-nymore-anchor?qt-latest_trending_article_page=1","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9726899862,"token_count":729,"score":3.25,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Visit a Travel Clinic Before Going AbroadEn Espa\u00f1ol (Spanish Version)\nFood and Water-borne Illnesses | Vaccination Requirements | Travel Clinic Services | Post-travel Care\nWith the age of aviation, traveling the world has not only become easier, but it is also an enriching experience. Although some of us may stay within the limits of our national borders, many of us will travel to exotic locales in countries with varying degrees of sanitation and standards of hygiene. The risk of food- or water-borne illnesses, as well as more harmful diseases while on vacation, including malaria and yellow fever, can be a reality of travel. Despite these significant health risks, many will not seek medical advice before a trip. But whether your destination is Cancun or Calcutta, it may be well worth the time to visit a travel health clinic before your departure.\nThe following individuals should seek medical advice before traveling abroad:\n- Infants and young children\n- Those with chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, irritable bowel syndrome, epilepsy, or HIV infection\n- Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy\n- Persons on prescription medications including H-2 blockers and antacids\n- Pregnant women\nWhile these individuals must take extra precautions when traveling, anyone planning a trip overseas should consider seeking medical advice from a travel clinic.\nFood and Water-borne Illnesses\nFood- and water-borne illnesses, such as traveler\u2019s diarrhea, are the most common maladies faced during travel. Contaminated food and water can be sources of infection from Escherichia coli, bacillary dysentery, and hepatitis A\u2014all of which can lead to severe dehydration. In general, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends drinking only bottled water (be sure it is a fresh bottle by checking the seal) and avoiding undercooked or raw foods (especially vegetable and fruits), dairy products, shellfish, or food that has been allowed to cool to room temperature. Based on the country you will be visiting, a travel health clinic can provide you with a complete list of CDC precautions and recommendations along with necessary antibiotics and water sanitation devices.\nDepending on your destination, general health risks can range from the common cold to typhoid fever. The World Health Organization (WHO) cites malaria as one of the most serious risks to international travelers. This potentially fatal disease, transmitted through mosquito bites, occurs in more than 100 countries\u2014many of which are popular destinations, such as Mexico, the Caribbean, India, Egypt, and South Africa. Also of concern are vaccine-preventable hepatitis A and B, both of which can cause liver damage.\nTravel health clinics can provide you with information about the year-round health risks that exist in your destination and alert you about new outbreaks that may arise prior to your time of travel. They will also provide you with the recommended immunizations and antibiotics to safeguard against tropical and other illnesses. Of main concern are the following:\n- Hepatitis A or B\u2014Mexico, Central and South America, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, the Caribbean, eastern and southern Europe\n- Malaria\u2014Asia, Africa, the Middle East, the South Pacific, Mexico, Eastern Europe, Central America, and the Caribbean\n- Traveler\u2019s diarrhea\u2014Latin America, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East\n- Yellow fever\u2014Africa and South America\n- Cholera\u2014Southeast Asia\n- Typhoid\u2014Asia, Africa, Soviet Union\n- Japanese encephalitis\u2014Southeast Asia\nWhile some countries only recommend that visitors get vaccinated before arriving, others require vaccination as a condition of entry, and will inspect health records to verify that the necessary vaccinations have been taken. In these countries, anyone who has not been vaccinated may be quarantined until they have been, or denied entry altogether. A travel health clinic can determine the vaccination requirements for your destination, administer inoculations and provide you with the necessary documentation, such as an International Certificate of Vaccination as well as other travel health records, which can be updated before each trip.\nTravel Clinic Services\nYour destination, length of stay, itinerary, and previous medical history are important factors to consider when seeking travel health advice. The staffs at most travel health clinics consist of physicians and nurse practitioners with specialized degrees in infectious diseases or tropical medicine. They are qualified to develop a travel care plan customized to your individual health needs; administer vaccines and booster shots for polio or measles, mumps, and rubella; and write prescriptions for antibiotics and other medications. It is important to make an appointment 4-6 weeks in advance of your trip. This will give you enough time to begin a malaria vaccine regimen if you need to, and for vaccinations to boost your immune system before your trip.\nIn general, services provided by most travel health clinics include:\n- CDC and WHO information about health risks and recommendations in your area of travel\n- United States State Department travel advisories; consulate information\n- Pre-travel counseling based on destination, length of stay, and medical history, including how to care for chronic conditions while traveling\n- An individualized plan of prevention and treatment, including recommendations for food and water safety, and recommendations for avoiding insect-borne diseases\n- Vaccinations for influenza; hepatitis A and B; yellow fever; typhoid; polio; tetanus\/diphtheria; Japanese encephalitis; measles, mumps, and rubella; and rabies\n- Vaccination certificates required by some countries before entry\n- Antibiotics or over-the-counter medications for diarrhea or prescriptions for malaria prevention\n- Permanent medical records listing any present illness as well as medical needs\n- A list of recommended doctors or clinics abroad\n- Information about traveler\u2019s medical insurance, which provides affordable coverage for medical emergencies (also check with your current provider)\n- Tests to determine whether any illnesses were acquired abroad\n- Treatment of any illnesses acquired abroad\nAnother essential aspect of travel clinic services is post-travel care. This is particularly important for those with chronic conditions and anyone experiencing persistent health problems upon their return, including the following:\n- Fever (seek immediate attention if you have traveled to an area where malaria is prevalent)\n- Urinary tract or genital infections\n- Skin disorders\nMany hospitals and medical centers provide travel health services.

Naturalization papers are an important source of information about an immigrant's nation of origin, his foreign and \u201cAmericanized\u201d names, residence, and date of arrival.\nImmigrants to the United States have never been required to apply for citizenship. An immigrant could become a citizen anytime after they arrived in the United States. Of those who applied, many did not complete the requirements to become a citizen.\nBefore 1906, the information recorded on naturalization records differed widely. Naturalization records before 1906 are not likely to give town of origin or names of parents. However, naturalization records after 1906 contain more information than earlier records. Information in post-1906 records is more detailed and may include birth dates, birth places, and other immigration information about the immigrant and members of his family.\nBefore 1906, naturalization records may contain:\n- Port of arrival\n- Date of arrival\n- Age of immigrant\n- Residence of immigrant\n- Country of origin or allegiance\nIn 1906, the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization was created.  (Later called Immigration and Naturalization Services or INS.) The result was standardized forms throughout the country and a copy of the naturalization papers sent to the INS in addition to the court keeping a copy.\nAfter 1906, naturalization records may contain:\n- Birth date & place of immigrant\n- Spouse & children\n- Birth dates and places for spouse & children\n- Port of arrival\n- Date of arrival\n- Vessel of arrival\n- Physical Description\n- Marriage date\n- Last Foreign Address\n- Marital status\nNaturalization records began in Colonia times. The requirements and process of naturalization have changed many times over the years. The basic requirements have been residency in the country for a given period of time, good moral character, and an oath of loyalty or allegiance given in a court of record.\nColonial Naturalization (Pre-1790)\nBritish immigrants were automatically citizens of the colonies (British Empire). A few Protestant immigrants from other countries gave oaths of allegiance or appeared before a civil authority to request citizenship (a process sometimes referred to as denization). Seven of the original colonies had their own laws for naturalizing foreigners as citizens of the British Empire colony. After the Revolutionary War, the individual states established their own naturalization laws and procedures.\nTypes of Colonial Naturalization\n- Denization--A type of naturalization used to obtain land. You could buy and sell land, but could not hold public office. There were no political privileges associated with denization.\n- Oath of Allegiance--This type of naturalization during the colonial period was used to renounce all former country loyalties. This gave the immigrant full privileges, including voting and holding public office.\n- Collective citizenship--This naturalization process was used to naturalize a group of people without using documents. Collective naturalization happened when the United States became a country in 1776 and all those living in the country (except Native Americans and African Americans) were collectively and automatically made US citizens.\nNaturalization From 1790-1906\nThe first naturalization law was enacted in 1790. Over the years, naturalization laws changed numerous times, but generally speaking the process required a Declaration of Intention and a Petition to be filed to become a citizen (Except during the years 1798 to 1828. see Report and Registry listed below). After 1906, several other documents were created during the naturalization process.\nThe immigrant also had to be a resident in the United States 5 years and a 1 year resident in the the state before becoming a citizen. In 1795, there was a 3 year waiting period, later changed to 2 years in 1824, between filing the declaration and the petition.\nThe naturalization process is completed in a court of law. The process usually required several steps to complete and various documents related to naturalization may be found in the court records described below.\nThe typical naturalization process involved three steps:\n- Declaration of Intention. The immigrant filed a declaration of intention (also called first papers) to renounce allegiance to foreign governments and to later prove he or she had resided in the country long enough to apply for citizenship. Residency laws changed consistently over time ranging from no residency requirement (meaning they could declare right after they \"came off the boat\") to 14 years residency. However, generally speaking, an immigrant filed a declaration of intention up to two years after he immigrated to the United States. The immigrant could declare any time after he arrived after fulfilling the residency requirement. Some immigrants waited as late as 20 years after coming to the United States to begin the process to become a citizen. There are some exceptions to the naturalization process where the immigrant was not required to file a declaration.\n- Petition. The immigrant had to wait anywhere between one to three years after he filed his declaration to file his petition for citizenship (also called second or final papers). Most often the petition was filed in a court nearest to the town where the immigrant settled. An Oath of Allegiance was also signed to pledge the immigrants allegiance to the Untied States and sign a written oath.\n- Certificate. After all requirements were completed, the immigrant was sworn in as a citizen and issued his or her certificate. The certificate is given from the same court the petition is filed in. It is called the Certificate of Citizenship or Certificate of Naturalization.\nReport and Registry, 1798-1828\nFrom 1798 to 1828, a new immigrant was required to appear before a local court and register his arrival in the United States. This was usually recorded in the court minutes. Sometimes a separate document, a report and registry or aliens' register was created instead. The immigrant could obtain a certificate showing that he had registered in order to prove his residency later when he applied for citizenship. The Report and Registry could take place at a different time and different court than the immigrant's declaration.\nThe Report and Registry may include the following information depending on the court recording the information:\n- Name of immigrant\n- Nation of allegiance\n- County of migration\n- Place of intended settlement\nNaturalization After 1906\nWhen the INS was created in 1906, other naturalization records were created to process naturalizations and keep track of immigrants in the United States. Copies of these documents are only in the possession of the former INS, now United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). A summary of some of these documents are listed below:\n- Certificate of Arrival, 1906 to the present--After 1906 an immigrant was required to submit a certificate of arrival when he petitioned for citizenship in order to prove the length of his residency. This document gives the place of entry, manner of arrival, and date of arrival. This was kept in the file with the petition.\n- Certificate of Registry--A certificate created by the INS to document immigrants who arrived prior to July 1, 1924 to the United States where no original arrival record could not be located.\n- Visa and Application--Began with the Immigration Act of 1924. All aliens had to have a Visa to enter the United States. Visas were obtained at US Embassies and Consulates abroad. Visa Files contain birth information, parents, children, previous residence and a photograph beginning in 1929.\n- Alien Registration--The Alien Registration Act of 1940 required that every non-citizen of the United States, age 14 years and up, had to register and fill out the Alien Registration form. The Alien Registration Program created a specific form, AR-2, for this program and forms were created from 1 Aug 1940 to 31 Mar 1944 during World War II. All original alien registration forms were microfilmed and are at the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. The originals were destroyed after filming.\n- An alien registration form contains the following information:\n- Name at time of entry to the US\n- Other names used\n- Date of Birth\n- Marital Status\n- Height & Weight\n- Hair & Eye Color\n- Port, date, ship, and class of admission at last arrival in US\n- Date of first arrival in US\n- Years lived in US\n- Intended stay in US\n- Usual occupation\n- Present occupation\n- Present employer, including address\n- Club, organization, or society memberships\n- Military service (Country, branch, dates)\n- Date and number of Declaration of Intention (if filed), and city and State where filed\n- Date of Petition for Naturalization (if filed), and city and State where filed\n- Arrest history\n- Date and place of registration\nNaturalization Records by State\nLocating Naturalization Records\nBy Time Period - What to Know Before Searching\nColonial Naturalization Records (Pre-1790)\nNaturalization records before 1790 differ vastly from later naturalization records. Colonial naturalizations consist mostly of lists of those that took the oath of allegience. The colony where the immigrant was living had jurisdiction over naturalizations.\nA good source to begin searching for colonial naturalization records is William P. Filby's Passenger and Immigration Lists Index, 1500s- 1900s. This source has indexed published passenger lists as well as early published naturalization records. Passenger and Immigration Lists Index, 1500s- 1900s includes the original sources where the information came from.\nPassenger and Immigration Lists Index, 1500s- 1900s is available in book form, CD-ROM, and Ancestry.com. There are several sets and supplements that have been added to the original publication. The most current supplement, 2009 is in book form and not included in the CD-ROM or Ancestry.com database.\nRecords Between 1790 and September 1906\nAn immigrant may have completed naturalization proceedings through any of 5,000 federal, state, or local courts that had the authority to grant citizenship. Naturalization proceedings were most often completed in county, superior or common pleas courts, or in state and U.S. circuit and district courts. Because some municipal, police, criminal, probate, and other courts also provided this service, you may need to search the records of all local courts.\nYou may need to search the records of each place where your immigrant ancestor lived to locate both naturalization records. He may have filed the declartion of intention in one court in one state and filed the petition several years later in another court and state. Begin first by looking for naturalization records in the courts of the county or city where the immigrant settled. Most likely the petition (second papers) was filed in that county or city.\nRecords Since September 1906\nBeginning in September 1906, the federal government began regulating the naturalization process. The Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization (now the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services or USCIS) required specific forms for declarations and petitions. Only these forms could be used and the Bureau controlled the number of courts able to naturalize by controlling distribution of the forms. However, both state and federal courts were allowed to naturalize.\nThe Declaration of Intent (Form 2202) was completed in triplicate. The court kept the original and gave copies to the applicant and the Bureau. The applicant was to use the declaration to apply for the petition. If the declaration is still in possession of the family, the immigrant probably did not complete the process and was not a citizen. The Petition for Naturalization (Form 2204) was kept by the court and a duplicate was sent to the INS. The Certificate of Naturalization (Form 2207) was given to the new citizen and a stub of the Certificate was kept in the court to prove it was issued. A duplicate of the petition was sent to the INS.\nIn 1929 the INS changed the forms and required photographs of the applicants. Because the new forms were not distributed immediately, many state courts ceased naturalizing. However, naturalizations were still taking place in local county courts as well as federal courts and the records of any court still naturalizing should be consulted to locate your ancestor's records.\nFinding Naturalization Records\nImmigrants could naturalize in any court that performed naturalizations. That included city, county, state and federal courts. After 1906, federal courts naturalized many immigrants, however, other local courts continued to naturalize as late as 1985. Check all possible courts in the area your ancestor lived.\nBegin by looking for naturalization records in the courts of the county or city where the immigrant lived. Look first for the petition (second papers), because they are usually easier to find in courts near where the immigant eventually settled. After 1906, the declaration can be filed with the petition as the immigrant was required to submit a copy when he submitted the petition.\nBecause immigrants were allowed to naturalize in any court, they often selected the most convenient court. If they lived in New Jersey but worked in New York City, also check the courts of New York City for the naturalization records. If an immigrant lived on the border of a county, they may have naturalized in the adjacent county because the courthouse may have been closer.\nLocating the Correct District Court\nOne federal court that may contain your ancestor's naturalization records is the District Court. However, to search the these records you must first determine the correct district court. Click on United States District Court Jurisdictions to help you identify the correct District Court. You must know the county your ancestor resided in.\nOn the Internet\nThere are many online resources available for researching naturalization records. These online resources include naturalization indexes as well as digital images of naturalization records.\n- Online Searchable Naturalization Indexes and Records--This website contains links to naturalization indexes and records.

Some are submitted by Olive Tree Genealogy(OTG) volunteers.\n- United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)--After 1906, a copy of all naturalization records were sent to the Immigration and Naturalization Service or INS, now called the USCIS. You may access their records through the USCIS Genealogy Program. Their website is www.uscis.gov. More details are listed below under, Using the Genealogy Program at the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.\nAt the Family History Library\nNaturalization records at the library are listed in the Place Search of the Family History Library Catalog under one of the following:\n[STATE] - NATURALIZATION AND CITIZENSHIP\n[STATE], [COUNTY] - NATURALIZATION AND CITIZENSHIP\n[STATE], [COUNTY], [TOWN] - NATURALIZATION AND CITIZENSHIP\nThe library has also acquired large collections of naturalization records from the National Archives branches in Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and Seattle.\nIn some states, naturalization records are included in other court records and are not separately identified. The state research outlines will help you locate these records.\nA key reference book is:\n\u2022 Schaefer, Christina K. Guide to Naturalization Records in the United States. Baltimore, Maryland: Genealogical Publishing Company, 1997. (FHL book 973 P4s.) It identifies records at both the National Archives and the Family History Library. It also describes many state and county courthouse collections. This book was published in 1997 and has not been updated. The Family History Library has added naturalization records to their collection since the publication.\nAt Regional Archives and other Repositories\nThe clerk of the court where the immigrant was naturalized may still have the original records. Some copies of court naturalization records have been transferred to National Archives regional branches. Check these Regional Branches for Federal Court Records as they charge less than the USCIS.\nNational Archive regional branches have websites that often state which naturalization records they have available.

Even if an immigrant ancestor did not complete the process and become a citizen, he may have begun the process and filed a declaration of intention\nIf your immigrant lived until after 1900, you should locate them on as many censuses as you can.\nCensus Records \u2013 1900 to 1930\nThe 1900, 1910, 1920, and 1930 Censuses each ask the year an immigrant arrived to the United States. It also asks if the individual was naturalized or not. The codes for naturalization are as follows:\n- PA: The individual began the naturalized process and has submitted a declaration of intention.\n- NA: The individual has completed the naturalization process and is a US Citizen.\n- AL: The immigrant had not yet naturalized or even begun the process. Not every immigrant naturalized.\n- NR: The census taker did not report the citizenship information.\nThe 1920 Census also asks the year the individual naturalized. The 1920 Census is the only year this question is asked.\nCertificate of Naturalization or Certificate of Citizenship:\nIt is helpful to know if your ancestor naturalized. Documents found in your family\u2019s possession may indicate if your ancestor naturalized. One document you may find in your family's possession is a Certificate of Naturalization or Certificate of Citizenship. This document indicates that your ancestor completed the process, and was a naturalized citizen of the United States. The certificate also states the court where the petition was filed. This helps locate a copy of the petition, which can contain more information about the immigrant.\nIf your ancestor had a United States passport, your ancestor completed the naturalization process and was a US Citizen. Passports were only given to U.S. citizens. They were and was not required for travel outside of the United States during times of war. Often newly naturalized citizens would obtain passports to keep them from being drafted in their native country's military. For more information about United States Passports, click here.\nTips for Success\nFor success in finding naturalization records and obtaining the information desired, remember that there are limitations in naturalization records, exceptions to the naturalization process and search strategies that should be used such as checking spelling variations.\nTown of Origin\nMost researchers hope to find the town of origin in naturalization records. This information usually is listed in naturalization records after 1906 when the forms were standardized. Before 1906, often the country of origin is only listed and the town not normally given. However, because each court recorded different information prior to 1906, it is important to search the earlier naturalization records.\nPrior to 1906, each court created their own naturalization forms. Each form was different, so information recorded on the form differed. You may find substantial information in one court (date and place of immigration, age of applicant, place of birth) and very little information (name of aaplicant, country of origin) in another court. Thus, it is important to always obtain the naturalization records of an immigrant even if they naturalized before 1906.\nNames of Parents\nExceptions to the Naturalization Process\nThere are exceptions to naturalization process that can determine whether you find a declaration of intention or a petition for your ancestor or not.\nImmigrant children - even today - receive their citizenship from their parents. Starting in 1790, children recieved derivative citizenship from their father (or mother in some cases). Derivative citizenship is defined as getting one's citizenship from another person. When the child's father became naturalized, his children under 16 (or 18, depending on the year) automatically became citizenship. There was no paperwork that was created. To prove his or her citizenship, the child would need his or her father's certificate of citizenship (or certificate of naturalization).\nBeginning in 1824 until 1906, immigrants under the age of 21 (whose parents did not naturalize) could be naturalized without filing a declaration of intent after they reached the age of 21 and had met the residency requirements. The declaration was often submitted with the petition.\nIn 1855, derivative citizenship (obtaining one's citizenship from another person) was also available for immigrant women marrying US citizens or if their husbands obtained their citizenship during their marriage. The wife's proof that she was a US citizen was her husband's certificate of citizenship (or certificate of naturalization) and her marriage certificate.\nIn 1922, citizenship was no longer available to women through marriage. However, between 1907 to 1922, a woman could lose her US citizenship if she married an alien - even if she was born in the United States. For more information, read Marion L. Smith's article, Women and Naturalization, ca. 1802-1940.\nTo serve in the United States military, one did not need to be a United States citizen - even today. In fact, the United States Government passed some naturalization laws to help encourage new immigrants to serve in the military in their new homeland. These laws made becoming a naturalized citizen easier for the immigrant. The following are the laws concerning service in the military:\nArmy--Beginning in 1862, the Declaration was waived, and the residency requirement was reduced to one year, for a soldier with an honorable discharge.\nNavy & Marines--Beginning in 1894, with an honorable discharge, the Declaration was waived and the residency requirement was reduced to one year.\nWorld War I--In 1918, during WWI, the residency requirement was waived and the Declaration was also waived. Soldiers are naturalized at military posts.\nIn some instances, entire groups have been collectively granted U.S. citizenship. Collective naturalization is defined as a group of people all receiving their citizenship through an act of congress or treaty. In these cases you will not find individual naturalization papers.\nIn 1868, African-Americans made citizens by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Unites States Constitution. In 1924, Native Americans made finally made citizens - although some chiefs of tribes became citizens before this date. The Native Americans were not included in the Fouteeneth Amendment because they were considered a seperate nation.\nCollective naturalization also occurred for residents of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, Texas in 1845, and Hawaii in 1898.\nSearch all spellings of the surname. Think about how the surname was pronounced, and how it sounded in your ancestor's probable accent. The surname may be spelled differently in earlier records that were closer to your ancestor's immigration date.\nOther Naturalization Topics\nThere are over 150 US naturalization laws that have been enacted since 1790. These laws change the residency requirements and those that qualified for naturalization. A summary of some of the major naturalization acts passed by congress can be found here.\nThe United States Citizenship and Immigration Services has a full discussion of all naturalization laws in PDF format.\n- \u2191 1.0 1.1 Schaefer, Christina K.

The mixture is dissolved in a fluid called the mobile phase, which carries it through a structure holding another material called the stationary phase. The various constituents of the mixture travel at different speeds, causing them to separate. The separation is based on differential partitioning between the mobile and stationary phases. Subtle differences in a compound's partition coefficient result in differential retention on the stationary phase and thus changing the separation.\nChromatography may be preparative or analytical. The purpose of preparative chromatography is to separate the components of a mixture for more advanced use (and is thus a form of purification). Analytical chromatography is done normally with smaller amounts of material and is for measuring the relative proportions of analytes in a mixture. The two are not mutually exclusive.\nChromatography, literally \"color writing\", was first employed by Russian-Italian scientist Mikhail Tsvet in 1900. He continued to work with chromatography in the first decade of the 20th century, primarily for the separation of plant pigments such as chlorophyll, carotenes, and xanthophylls. Since these components have different colors (green, orange, and yellow, respectively) they gave the technique its name. New types of chromatography developed during the 1930s and 1940s made the technique useful for many separation processes.\nChromatography technique developed substantially as a result of the work of Archer John Porter Martin and Richard Laurence Millington Synge during the 1940s and 1950s. They established the principles and basic techniques of partition chromatography, and their work encouraged the rapid development of several chromatographic methods: paper chromatography, gas chromatography, and what would become known as high performance liquid chromatography. Since then, the technology has advanced rapidly. Researchers found that the main principles of Tsvet's chromatography could be applied in many different ways, resulting in the different varieties of chromatography described below. Advances are continually improving the technical performance of chromatography, allowing the separation of increasingly similar molecules.\nChromatography terms \n- The analyte is the substance to be separated during chromatography.\n- Analytical chromatography is used to determine the existence and possibly also the concentration of analyte(s) in a sample.\n- A bonded phase is a stationary phase that is covalently bonded to the support particles or to the inside wall of the column tubing.\n- A chromatogram is the visual output of the chromatograph. In the case of an optimal separation, different peaks or patterns on the chromatogram correspond to different components of the separated mixture.\n- Plotted on the x-axis is the retention time and plotted on the y-axis a signal (for example obtained by a spectrophotometer, mass spectrometer or a variety of other detectors) corresponding to the response created by the analytes exiting the system. In the case of an optimal system the signal is proportional to the concentration of the specific analyte separated.\n- A chromatograph is equipment that enables a sophisticated separation e.g. gas chromatographic or liquid chromatographic separation.\n- Chromatography is a physical method of separation that distributes components to separate between two phases, one stationary (stationary phase), while the other (the mobile phase) moves in a definite direction.\n- The eluate is the mobile phase leaving the column.\n- The eluent is the solvent that carries the analyte.\n- An eluotropic series is a list of solvents ranked according to their eluting power.\n- An immobilized phase is a stationary phase that is immobilized on the support particles, or on the inner wall of the column tubing.\n- The mobile phase is the phase that moves in a definite direction. It may be a liquid (LC and Capillary Electrochromatography (CEC)), a gas (GC), or a supercritical fluid (supercritical-fluid chromatography, SFC). The mobile phase consists of the sample being separated\/analyzed and the solvent that moves the sample through the column. In the case of HPLC the mobile phase consists of a non-polar solvent(s) such as hexane in normal phase or polar solvents in reverse phase chromotagraphy and the sample being separated. The mobile phase moves through the chromatography column (the stationary phase) where the sample interacts with the stationary phase and is separated.\n- Preparative chromatography is used to purify sufficient quantities of a substance for further use, rather than analysis.\n- The retention time is the characteristic time it takes for a particular analyte to pass through the system (from the column inlet to the detector) under set conditions. See also: Kovats' retention index\n- The sample is the matter analyzed in chromatography. It may consist of a single component or it may be a mixture of components. When the sample is treated in the course of an analysis, the phase or the phases containing the analytes of interest is\/are referred to as the sample whereas everything out of interest separated from the sample before or in the course of the analysis is referred to as waste.\n- The solute refers to the sample components in partition chromatography.\n- The solvent refers to any substance capable of solubilizing another substance, and especially the liquid mobile phase in liquid chromatography.\n- The stationary phase is the substance fixed in place for the chromatography procedure. Examples include the silica layer in thin layer chromatography\nChromatography is based on the concept of partition coefficient. Any solute partitions between two immiscible solvents. When we make one solvent immobile (by adsorption on a solid support matrix) and another mobile it results in most common applications of chromatography. If matrix support is polar (e.g. paper, silica etc.) it is forward phase chromatography, and if it is non polar (C-18) it is reverse phase.\nTechniques by chromatographic bed shape \nColumn chromatography \nColumn chromatography is a separation technique in which the stationary bed is within a tube. The particles of the solid stationary phase or the support coated with a liquid stationary phase may fill the whole inside volume of the tube (packed column) or be concentrated on or along the inside tube wall leaving an open, unrestricted path for the mobile phase in the middle part of the tube (open tubular column). Differences in rates of movement through the medium are calculated to different retention times of the sample.\nIn 1978, W. C. Still introduced a modified version of column chromatography called flash column chromatography (flash). The technique is very similar to the traditional column chromatography, except for that the solvent is driven through the column by applying positive pressure. This allowed most separations to be performed in less than 20 minutes, with improved separations compared to the old method. Modern flash chromatography systems are sold as pre-packed plastic cartridges, and the solvent is pumped through the cartridge. Systems may also be linked with detectors and fraction collectors providing automation. The introduction of gradient pumps resulted in quicker separations and less solvent usage.\nIn expanded bed adsorption, a fluidized bed is used, rather than a solid phase made by a packed bed. This allows omission of initial clearing steps such as centrifugation and filtration, for culture broths or slurries of broken cells.\nPhosphocellulose chromatography utilizes the binding affinity of many DNA-binding proteins for phosphocellulose. The stronger a protein's interaction with DNA, the higher the salt concentration needed to elute that protein.\nPlanar chromatography \nPlanar chromatography is a separation technique in which the stationary phase is present as or on a plane. The plane can be a paper, serving as such or impregnated by a substance as the stationary bed (paper chromatography) or a layer of solid particles spread on a support such as a glass plate (thin layer chromatography). Different compounds in the sample mixture travel different distances according to how strongly they interact with the stationary phase as compared to the mobile phase. The specific Retention factor (Rf) of each chemical can be used to aid in the identification of an unknown substance.\nPaper chromatography \nPaper chromatography is a technique that involves placing a small dot or line of sample solution onto a strip of chromatography paper. The paper is placed in a jar containing a shallow layer of solvent and sealed. As the solvent rises through the paper, it meets the sample mixture, which starts to travel up the paper with the solvent. This paper is made of cellulose, a polar substance, and the compounds within the mixture travel farther if they are non-polar. More polar substances bond with the cellulose paper more quickly, and therefore do not travel as far.\nThin layer chromatography \nThin layer chromatography (TLC) is a widely employed laboratory technique and is similar to paper chromatography. However, instead of using a stationary phase of paper, it involves a stationary phase of a thin layer of adsorbent like silica gel, alumina, or cellulose on a flat, inert substrate. Compared to paper, it has the advantage of faster runs, better separations, and the choice between different adsorbents. For even better resolution and to allow for quantification, high-performance TLC can be used.\nDisplacement chromatography \nThe basic principle of displacement chromatography is: A molecule with a high affinity for the chromatography matrix (the displacer) competes effectively for binding sites, and thus displace all molecules with lesser affinities. There are distinct differences between displacement and elution chromatography. In elution mode, substances typically emerge from a column in narrow, Gaussian peaks. Wide separation of peaks, preferably to baseline, is desired for maximum purification. The speed at which any component of a mixture travels down the column in elution mode depends on many factors. But for two substances to travel at different speeds, and thereby be resolved, there must be substantial differences in some interaction between the biomolecules and the chromatography matrix. Operating parameters are adjusted to maximize the effect of this difference. In many cases, baseline separation of the peaks can be achieved only with gradient elution and low column loadings. Thus, two drawbacks to elution mode chromatography, especially at the preparative scale, are operational complexity, due to gradient solvent pumping, and low throughput, due to low column loadings. Displacement chromatography has advantages over elution chromatography in that components are resolved into consecutive zones of pure substances rather than \u201cpeaks\u201d. Because the process takes advantage of the nonlinearity of the isotherms, a larger column feed can be separated on a given column with the purified components recovered at significantly higher concentrations.\nTechniques by physical state of mobile phase \nGas chromatography \nGas chromatography (GC), also sometimes known as gas-liquid chromatography, (GLC), is a separation technique in which the mobile phase is a gas. Gas chromatography is always carried out in a column, which is typically \"packed\" or \"capillary\" (see below).\nGas chromatography is based on a partition equilibrium of analyte between a solid stationary phase (often a liquid silicone-based material) and a mobile gas (most often helium). The stationary phase is adhered to the inside of a small-diameter glass tube (a capillary column) or a solid matrix inside a larger metal tube (a packed column). It is widely used in analytical chemistry; though the high temperatures used in GC make it unsuitable for high molecular weight biopolymers or proteins (heat denatures them), frequently encountered in biochemistry, it is well suited for use in the petrochemical, environmental monitoring and remediation, and industrial chemical fields. It is also used extensively in chemistry research.\nLiquid chromatography \nLiquid chromatography (LC) is a separation technique in which the mobile phase is a liquid. Liquid chromatography can be carried out either in a column or a plane. Present day liquid chromatography that generally utilizes very small packing particles and a relatively high pressure is referred to as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).\nIn HPLC the sample is forced by a liquid at high pressure (the mobile phase) through a column that is packed with a stationary phase composed of irregularly or spherically shaped particles, a porous monolithic layer, or a porous membrane. HPLC is historically divided into two different sub-classes based on the polarity of the mobile and stationary phases. Methods in which the stationary phase is more polar than the mobile phase (e.g., toluene as the mobile phase, silica as the stationary phase) are termed normal phase liquid chromatography (NPLC) and the opposite (e.g., water-methanol mixture as the mobile phase and C18 = octadecylsilyl as the stationary phase) is termed reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC). Ironically the \"normal phase\" has fewer applications and RPLC is therefore used considerably more.\nSpecific techniques under this broad heading are listed below.\nAffinity chromatography \nAffinity chromatography is based on selective non-covalent interaction between an analyte and specific molecules. It is very specific, but not very robust. It is often used in biochemistry in the purification of proteins bound to tags. These fusion proteins are labeled with compounds such as His-tags, biotin or antigens, which bind to the stationary phase specifically. After purification, some of these tags are usually removed and the pure protein is obtained.\nAffinity chromatography often utilizes a biomolecule's affinity for a metal (Zn, Cu, Fe, etc.). Columns are often manually prepared. Traditional affinity columns are used as a preparative step to flush out unwanted biomolecules.\nHowever, HPLC techniques exist that do utilize affinity chromatogaphy properties. Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) is useful to separate aforementioned molecules based on the relative affinity for the metal (I.e. Dionex IMAC). Often these columns can be loaded with different metals to create a column with a targeted affinity.\nSupercritical fluid chromatography \nSupercritical fluid chromatography is a separation technique in which the mobile phase is a fluid above and relatively close to its critical temperature and pressure.\nTechniques by separation mechanism \nIon exchange chromatography \nIon exchange chromatography (usually referred to as ion chromatography) uses an ion exchange mechanism to separate analytes based on their respective charges. It is usually performed in columns but can also be useful in planar mode. Ion exchange chromatography uses a charged stationary phase to separate charged compounds including anions, cations, amino acids, peptides, and proteins. In conventional methods the stationary phase is an ion exchange resin that carries charged functional groups that interact with oppositely charged groups of the compound to retain. Ion exchange chromatography is commonly used to purify proteins using FPLC.\nSize-exclusion chromatography \nSize-exclusion chromatography (SEC) is also known as gel permeation chromatography (GPC) or gel filtration chromatography and separates molecules according to their size (or more accurately according to their hydrodynamic diameter or hydrodynamic volume). Smaller molecules are able to enter the pores of the media and, therefore, molecules are trapped and removed from the flow of the mobile phase. The average residence time in the pores depends upon the effective size of the analyte molecules. However, molecules that are larger than the average pore size of the packing are excluded and thus suffer essentially no retention; such species are the first to be eluted. It is generally a low-resolution chromatography technique and thus it is often reserved for the final, \"polishing\" step of a purification. It is also useful for determining the tertiary structure and quaternary structure of purified proteins, especially since it can be carried out under native solution conditions.\nExpanded Bed Adsorption (EBA) Chromatographic Separation \nExpanded Bed Adsorption (EBA) Chromatographic Separation captures a target protein from a crude feed stream when it passes through a chromatography column system containing adsorbent beads. With this technique the crude feedstock can be treated directly in the chromatographic column, avoiding the traditional clarification and pre-treatment steps. EBA Chromatographic Separation is highly scalable, from laboratory-based 1 cm diameter columns to large production columns up to 2 meter in diameter. These columns can typically handle feed stock throughput of more than 1,000,000 liter per day with a production capacity of 1000 MT protein per year.\nSpecial techniques \nReversed-phase chromatography \nReversed-phase chromatography (RPC) is any liquid chromatography procedure in which the mobile phase is significantly more polar than the stationary phase. It is so named because in normal-phase liquid chromatography, the mobile phase is significantly less polar than the stationary phase. Hydrophobic molecules in the mobile phase tend to adsorb to the relatively hydrophobic stationary phase. Hydrophilic molecules in the mobile phase will tend to elute first.\nTwo-dimensional chromatography \nIn some cases, the chemistry within a given column can be insufficient to separate some analytes. It is possible to direct a series of unresolved peaks onto a second column with different physico-chemical (Chemical classification) properties. Since the mechanism of retention on this new solid support is different from the first dimensional separation, it can be possible to separate compounds that are indistinguishable by one-dimensional chromatography. The sample is spotted at one corner of a square plate,developed, air-dried, then rotated by 90\u00b0 and usually redeveloped in a second solvent system.\nSimulated moving-bed chromatography \nPyrolysis gas chromatography \nPyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry is a method of chemical analysis in which the sample is heated to decomposition to produce smaller molecules that are separated by gas chromatography and detected using mass spectrometry.\nPyrolysis is the thermal decomposition of materials in an inert atmosphere or a vacuum. The sample is put into direct contact with a platinum wire, or placed in a quartz sample tube, and rapidly heated to 600\u20131000 \u00b0C. Depending on the application even higher temperatures are used. Three different heating techniques are used in actual pyrolyzers: Isothermal furnace, inductive heating (Curie Point filament), and resistive heating using platinum filaments. Large molecules cleave at their weakest points and produce smaller, more volatile fragments. These fragments can be separated by gas chromatography. Pyrolysis GC chromatograms are typically complex because a wide range of different decomposition products is formed. The data can either be used as fingerprint to prove material identity or the GC\/MS data is used to identify individual fragments to obtain structural information. To increase the volatility of polar fragments, various methylating reagents can be added to a sample before pyrolysis.\nBesides the usage of dedicated pyrolyzers, pyrolysis GC of solid and liquid samples can be performed directly inside Programmable Temperature Vaporizer (PTV) injectors that provide quick heating (up to 30 \u00b0C\/s) and high maximum temperatures of 600\u2013650 \u00b0C. This is sufficient for some pyrolysis applications. The main advantage is that no dedicated instrument has to be purchased and pyrolysis can be performed as part of routine GC analysis. In this case quartz GC inlet liners have to be used. Quantitative data can be acquired, and good results of derivatization inside the PTV injector are published as well.\nFast protein liquid chromatography \nFast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) is a term applied to several chromatography techniques which are used to purify proteins. Many of these techniques are identical to those carried out under high performance liquid chromatography, however use of FPLC techniques are typically for preparing large scale batches of a purified product.\nCountercurrent chromatography \nCountercurrent chromatography (CCC) is a type of liquid-liquid chromatography, where both the stationary and mobile phases are liquids. The operating principle of CCC equipment requires a column consisting of an open tube coiled around a bobbin. The bobbin is rotated in a double-axis gyratory motion (a cardioid), which causes a variable gravity (G) field to act on the column during each rotation. This motion causes the column to see one partitioning step per revolution and components of the sample separate in the column due to their partitioning coefficient between the two immiscible liquid phases used. There are many types of CCC available today. These include HSCCC (High Speed CCC) and HPCCC (High Performance CCC). HPCCC is the latest and best performing version of the instrumentation available currently.\nChiral chromatography \nChiral chromatography involves the separation of stereoisomers. In the case of enantiomers, these have no chemical or physical differences apart from being three-dimensional mirror images. Conventional chromatography or other separation processes are incapable of separating them. To enable chiral separations to take place, either the mobile phase or the stationary phase must themselves be made chiral, giving differing affinities between the analytes. Chiral chromatography HPLC columns (with a chiral stationary phase) in both normal and reversed phase are commercially available.\nSee also \n- IUPAC Nomenclature for Chromatography IUPAC Recommendations 1993, Pure & Appl.

{"text":"In my next few blogs, I will provide an overview of Voltage Source Converter (VSC) HVDC technology and its suitability for Smart Grids operation and control discussed.\nVSC HVDC is based upon transistor technology and was developed in the 1990\u2032s. The switching element is the Insulated Gate Bipolar Thyristor (IGBT), which can be switched on and off by applying a suitable voltage to the gate (steering electrode). Because of the more switching operations, and the nature of the semiconductor devices itself, the converter losses are generally higher than those of HVDC classic converters.\nVSC HVDC is commonly used with underground or submarine cables with a transfer capacity in the range of 10 \u2013 1000 MW, and is suitable to serve as a connection to a wind farm or supply a remote load. VSC HVDC technology has very fast steer and control functionality and is suitable for meshed networks. It is characterised by compactness of the converter stations, due to the reduced need for AC harmonic filters and reactive power compensation. Power flow reversal in VSC systems is achieved by reversal of the current, whereas in HVDC classic systems the voltage polarity has to change. An important consequence of this voltage source behavior is the ability to use cheaper and easier to install XLPE cables, instead of the mass-impregnated cables that are needed for HVDC classic.\nCurrently, only twelve VSC HVDC projects are in service. A few examples include: Estlink, which connects Estonia to Finland (350 MW), and BorWin1, connecting an offshore wind farm to Northern Germany (400 MW). Both are equipped with \u00b1150 kV submarine cables, and the Trans Bay project in California (400 MW) that consists of 90 km \u00b1200 kV submarine cable.\nMost projects have submarine cable, but some projects include long lengths of underground cable, such as Murraylink (220 MW, 177 km underground cable), and Nord E.On 1 (400 MW, 75km underground cable).\nThe 500 MW East-West interconnector between Ireland and Great Britain, operating at \u00b1200 kV, is scheduled to go into service in 2012. A 2000 MW 65 km cable interconnector \u00b1320kV as part of the Trans European Network\u2014between Spain and France\u2014is scheduled for commissioning in 2013, and will represent the highest power rating for a VSC HVDC system installed at this time.\nMake sure to check back next Tuesday for my next blog on the comparison between HVDC classic and VSC HVDC.\nBy: Peter Vaessen","id":"<urn:uuid:7b22bc99-05e4-4dcf-9143-3715cd5724d7>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/smartgridsherpa.com\/blog\/voltage-source-converter-hvdc-a-key-technology-for-smart-grids","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9366721511,"token_count":536,"score":3.234375,"int_score":3}
{"text":"By Tom Boyle\nAll Things Birds Associate Naturalist\n|Natco Lake was created by accident, rather than by Mother Nature. The National Fireproofing Company (Natco) mined clay here for bricks in the 1930's. Eventually the mining equipment hit underground springs and the lake filled in. A ditch was dug in an attempt to drain off the water into a nearby tidal creek. The ditching brought in salt water and made the lake brackish, as it remains today.\nBirding the northern section of the lake:\nWalk east along the Henry Hudson Trail and over a small bridge. Eastern Phoebe has nested under this bridge. After the bridge, turn right off the paved trail and then left. Follow the unpaved trail a short distance to a small tidal cove in the lake. On a changing tide, Yellow-crowned Night Heron is regularly seen. Both night herons nest locally and can be seen frequently. Occasionally, Diamond-backed Terrapins are seen basking on flotsam in the cove. Continue on the unpaved trail until it ends at a lawn on the lake's north side.\nScan the lake here. Shorebirds can be found in migration, along with herons, Osprey, gulls, cormorants, terns, and waterfowl. Great Black-backed Gull has begun nesting on one of the islands in the lake. Don't be surprised to see something unusual. An American White Pelican was seen on the lake in January about five years ago. I've seen American Oystercatcher, Black Skimmer, and copulating Least Terns sitting on the island in front of you. This is a good spot to check for lingering waterfowl at World Series of Birding time [mid-May]. Northern Shoveler has been seen in late May, Canvasback in late June and a drake Bufflehead has lingered here into July! Rough-winged Swallows and Belted Kingfishers have nested in the dirt banks around the lake and are often seen.\nThe woods along the Henry Hudson Trail are good for migrants in spring. In recent years I've seen (and heard) Acadian, Alder, and Olive-sided Flycatchers; Gray-cheeked Thrush; Mourning and Brewster's Warblers; Yellow-breasted Chat; and Lincoln's and White-crowned Sparrows. Fall is equally good, and Connecticut Warbler is regular at that time of year. If you walk the trail a little more than a quarter mile to the next bridge, look north along Thorne's Creek for Purple Martins, which now nest in houses provided by a homeowner here.\nBirding the southern section of the lake:\nNatco Park, a 260-acre Green Acres site managed by Hazlet Township, consists of mature swampy woods excellent in spring for migrants. From the Lakeside Manor restaurant parking lot, walk down the Orange Trail near the lake and into the woods. Philadelphia Vireo has been seen here in late May. The mature oaks along this trail can have Bay-breasted, Tennessee, and Cape May Warblers. A knowledge of bird song will be helpful here as the vegetation is thick. The trail turns left and follows the shoreline, eventually coming to a small cove (1 on map) where Spotted Sandpipers are seen.\nAt the south end of the cove, the trail (now the Red Trail) turns southeasterly into the woods. A small footbridge crosses over a little ripple called Thorne's Creek. Here the understory is again very thick. In this area in spring I've seen such sought-after migrants as Yellow-throated Vireo; Louisiana Waterthrush; and Worm-Eating, Prothonotary, Hooded, and Kentucky Warblers.\nContinue south along the Red Trail. As you approach another footbridge, the Blue Trail comes in from the right. Follow it a short way to an area with standing water in spring (2). Check this spot for Rusty Blackbird and Northern Waterthrush.\nBack on the main Red Trail, continue south. The trail gains elevation, leading into an area of pitch pine habitat (3). Pine Warbler nests and Whip-poor-will has been found here.\nRetrace your steps back along the trail to the cove at the lake. Facing the cove, take the part of the Red Trail that leads left [west] away from the lake. The mature deciduous woods along the trail have nesting Wood Thrush, Ovenbird, and Red-eyed Vireo. This trail eventually comes to a T intersection with the Yellow Trail. Turn left onto the Yellow Trail, which will gain elevation until it arrives at another T intersection. Turn right on the unmarked trail and walk slowly to a small opening in the forest. In spring the vernal pond here (4) holds the occasional Solitary Sandpiper. Roosting above the pond in spring I've seen Broad-winged and Red-shouldered Hawks. Continuing along this trail will lead through several wet areas with second-growth woodland. Prairie, Mourning, and Wilson's Warblers have been seen here, and Brown Thrashers nest in this area.\nReturn to the last T, and turn left to retrace your route along the Yellow Trail. Pass the intersection with the Red Trail and continue straight ahead on the Yellow Trail to reach the parking lot.\nRaptors are very much in evidence in the Natco Lake area in spring as northbound hawks bump up against the bayshore. On west winds, hawk flights can be seen over the park right from the parking lot. These flights consist mostly of buteos, with vultures, accipiters, and the occasional Bald Eagle mixed in. Mississippi Kite and Common Raven were seen over the park in Spring 2012.\nAdditional breeding birds in the park include Scarlet Tanager, Great-crested Flycatcher, Ruby-throated Hummingbird, Cooper's Hawk, and Great Horned and Screech Owls. Northern Saw-whet Owl has occurred in winter. Mammals in the park include Whitetail Deer, Opossum, Raccoon, Striped Skunk, flying squirrel and both Red and Gray Fox. With its mix of deciduous swamp and upland pine oak forest, Natco is also very botanically diverse.\nNatco's mix of habitat, along with its location on the bayshore, makes it a great place to discover birds.\nFor more information on the park, including a more complete trail map, write to the Hazlet Environmental Commission at 317 Middle Road, Hazlet, NJ 07730.","id":"<urn:uuid:328eadc9-b603-4a3d-8065-19a298ab74c0>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.njaudubon.org\/SectionCenters\/SectionSHBO\/CloseFocusonNatcoLake.aspx","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9537419677,"token_count":1396,"score":2.609375,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Outmaneuvering Foodborne Pathogens\nAt various locations, ARS scientists are doing research to make leafy greens and other fresh produce safer for consumers. Produce and leafy greens in the photo are (clockwise from top): romaine lettuce, cabbage, cilantro in a bed of broccoli sprouts, spinach and other leafy greens, green onions, tomatoes, and green leaf lettuce.\nIf pathogens like E. coli O157:H7 or Salmonella had a motto for survival, it might be: \u201cFind! Bind! Multiply!\u201d\nThat pretty much sums up what these food-poisoning bacteria do in nature, moving through our environment to find a host they can bind to and use as a staging area for multiplying and spreading.\nBut ARS food-safety scientists in California are determined to find out how to stop these and other foodborne pathogenic bacteria in their tracks, before the microbes can make their way to leafy greens and other favorite salad ingredients like tomatoes and sprouts.\nThe research is needed to help prevent the pathogens from turning up in fresh produce that we typically eat uncooked. That\u2019s according to Robert E. Mandrell, who leads the ARS Produce Safety and Microbiology Research Unit. His team is based at the agency\u2019s Western Regional Research Center in Albany, California.\nThe team is pulling apart the lives of these microbes to uncover the secrets of their success. It\u2019s a complex challenge, in part because the microbes seem to effortlessly switch from one persona to the next. They are perhaps best known as residents of the intestines of warm-blooded animals, including humans. For another role, the pathogens have somehow learned to find, bind, and multiply in the world of green plants.\nSometimes the pathogenic microbes need the help of other microbial species to make the jump from animal inhabitant to plant resident. Surprisingly little is known about these powerful partnerships, Mandrell says. That\u2019s why such alliances among microbes are one of several specific aspects of the pathogens\u2019 lifestyles that the Albany scientists are investigating. In all, knowledge gleaned from these and other laboratory, greenhouse, and outdoor studies should lead to new, effective, environmentally friendly ways to thwart the pathogens before they have a chance to make us ill.\nIn a greenhouse, microbiologist Maria Brandl examines cilantro that she uses as a model plant to investigate the behavior of foodborne pathogens on leaf surfaces.\nA Pathogen Targets Youngest Leaves\nKnowing pathogens\u2019 preferences is essential to any well-planned counter-attack. So microbiologist Maria T. Brandl is scrutinizing the little-understood ability of E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enterica to contaminate the elongated, slightly sweet leaves of romaine lettuce. With a University of California-Berkeley colleague, Brandl has shown that, if given a choice, E. coli has a strong preference for the young, inner leaves. The researchers exposed romaine lettuce leaves to E. coli and found that the microbe multiplied about 10 times more on the young leaves than on the older, middle ones. One explanation: The young leaves are a better nutrition \u201cbuy\u201d for E. coli. \u201cThese leaves exude about three times more nitrogen and about one-and-one-half times more carbon than do the middle leaves,\u201d says Brandl.\nScientists have known for decades that plants exude compounds from their leaves and roots that bacteria and fungi can use as food. But the romaine lettuce study, published earlier this year in Applied and Environmental Microbiology, is the first to document the different exudate levels among leaves of the two age classes. It\u2019s also the first to show that E. coli can do more than just bind to lettuce leaves: It can multiply and spread on them.\nResearch assistant Danielle Goudeau inoculates a lettuce leaf with E. coli O157:H7 in a biological safety cabinet to study the biology of the human pathogen on leafy greens.\nAdding nitrogen to the middle leaves boosted E. coli growth, Brandl found. \u201cIn view of the key role of nitrogen in helping E. coli multiply on young leaves,\u201d she says, \u201ca strategy that minimizes use of nitrogen fertilizer in romaine lettuce fields may be worth investigating.\u201d\nIn other studies using romaine lettuce and the popular herb cilantro as models, Brandl documented the extent to which E. coli and Salmonella are aided by Erwinia chrysanthemi, an organism that causes fresh produce to rot.\n\u201cWhen compared to plant pathogens, E. coli and Salmonella are not as \u2018fit\u2019 on plants,\u201d Brandl says. But the presence of the rot-producing microbe helped E. coli and Salmonella grow on lettuce and cilantro leaves.\n\u201cSoft rot promoted formation of large aggregates, called \u2018biofilms,\u2019 of E. coli and Salmonella and increased their numbers by up to 100-fold,\u201d she notes.\nThe study uncovered new details about genes that the food-poisoning pathogens kick into action when teamed up with plant pathogens such as soft rot microbes.\nBrandl, in collaboration with Albany microbiologist Craig Parker, used a technique known as \u201cmicroarray analysis\u201d to spy on the genes. \u201cThe assays showed that Salmonella cells\u2014living in soft rot lesions on lettuce and cilantro\u2014had turned on some of the exact same genes that Salmonella uses when it infects humans or colonizes the intestines of animals,\u201d she says. Some of these activated genes were ones that Salmonella uses to get energy from several natural compounds common to both green plants and to the animal intestines that Salmonella calls home.\nUsing a confocal laser scanning microscope, microbiologist Maria Brandl examines a mixed biofilm of Salmonella enterica (pink) and Erwinia chrysanthemi (green) in soft rot lesions on cilantro leaves (blue).\nA One-Two Punch to Tomatoes\nSalmonella also benefits from the presence of another plant pathogen, specifically, Xanthomonas campestris, the culprit in a disease known as \u201cbacterial leaf spot of tomato.\u201d But the relationship between Salmonella and X. campestris may be different than the relation of Salmonella to the soft rot pathogen. Notably, Salmonella benefits even if the bacterial spot pathogen is at very low levels\u2014so low that the plant doesn\u2019t have the disease or any visible symptoms of it.\nThat\u2019s among the first-of-a-kind findings that microbiologist Jeri D. Barak found in her tests with tomato seeds exposed to the bacterial spot microbe and then planted in soil that had been irrigated with water contaminated with S. enterica.\nIn a recent article in PLoS ONE, Barak reported that S. enterica populations were significantly higher in tomato plants that had also been colonized by X. campestris. In some cases, Salmonella couldn\u2019t bind to and grow on\u2014or in\u2014tomato plants without the presence of X. campestris, she found.\nListeria monocytogenes on this broccoli sprout shows up as green fluorescence. The bacteria are mainly associated with the root hairs.\n\u201cWe think that X. campestris may disable the plant immune response\u2014a feat that allows both it and Salmonella to multiply,\u201d she says.\nThe study was the first to report that even as long as 6 weeks after soil was flooded with Salmonella-contaminated water, the microbe was capable of binding to tomato seeds planted in the tainted soil and, later, of spreading to the plant.\n\u201cThese results suggest that any contamination that introduces Salmonella from any source into the environment\u2014whether that source is irrigation water, improperly composted manure, or even insects\u2014could lead to subsequent crop contamination,\u201d Barak says. \u201cThat\u2019s true even if substantial time has passed since the soil was first contaminated.\u201d\nCrop debris can also serve as a reservoir of viable Salmonella for at least a week, Barak\u2019s study showed. For her investigation, the debris was composed of mulched, Salmonella-contaminated tomato plants mixed with uncontaminated soil.\n\u201cReplanting fields shortly after harvesting the previous crop is a common practice in farming of lettuce and tomatoes,\u201d she says. The schedule allows only a very short time for crop debris to decompose. \u201cOur results suggest that fields known to have been contaminated with S. enterica could benefit from an extended fallow period, perhaps of at least a few weeks.\u201d\nOrdinary Microbe Foils E. coli\nWhile the bacterial spot and soft rot microbes make life easier for certain foodborne pathogens, other microbes may make the pathogens\u2019 existence more difficult. Geneticist Michael B. Cooley and microbiologist William G. Miller at Albany have shown the remarkable effects of one such microbe, Enterobacter asburiae. This common, farm-and-garden-friendly microorganism lives peaceably on beans, cotton, and cucumbers.\nIn one experiment, E. asburiae significantly reduced levels of E. coli and Salmonella when all three species of microbes were inoculated on seeds of thale cress, a small plant often chosen for laboratory tests.\nThe study, published in Applied and Environmental Microbiology in 2003, led to followup experiments with green leaf lettuce. In that battle of the microbes, another rather ordinary bacterium, Wausteria paucula, turned out to be E. coli\u2019s new best friend, enhancing the pathogen\u2019s survival sixfold on lettuce leaves.\n\u201cIt was the first clear example of a microbe\u2019s supporting a human pathogen on a plant,\u201d notes Cooley, who documented the findings in the Journal of Food Protection in 2006.\nBut E. asburiae more than evened the score, decreasing E. coli survival 20- to 30-fold on lettuce leaves exposed to those two species of microbes.\nThe mechanisms underlying the competition between E. asburiae and E. coli are still a mystery, says Cooley, \u201cespecially the competition that takes place on leaves or other plant surfaces.\u201d\nNevertheless, E. asburiae shows initial promise of becoming a notable biological control agent to protect fresh salad greens or other crops from pathogen invaders. With further work, the approach could become one of several science-based solutions that will help keep our salads safe.\u2014By Marcia Wood, Agricultural Research Service Information Staff.\nThis research is part of Food Safety, an ARS national program (#108) described on the World Wide Web at www.nps.ars.usda.gov.\nTo reach scientists mentioned in this article, contact Marcia Wood, USDA-ARS Information Staff, 5601 Sunnyside Ave., Beltsville, MD 20705-5129; phone (301) 504-1662, fax (301) 504-1486.\nListeria monocytogenes on this radish sprout shows up as green fluorescence. The bacteria are mainly associated with the root hairs.\nWhat Genes Help Microbes Invade Leafy Greens?\nWhen unwanted microbes form an attachment, the consequences\u2014for us\u2014can be serious.\nThat\u2019s if the microbes happen to be human pathogens like Listeria monocytogenes or Salmonella enterica and if the target of their attentions happens to be fresh vegetables often served raw, such as cabbage or the sprouted seeds of alfalfa.\nScientists don\u2019t yet fully understand how the malevolent microbes form colonies that cling stubbornly to and spread across plant surfaces, such as the bumpy leaves of a cabbage or the ultra-fine root hairs of a tender alfalfa sprout.\nBut food safety researchers at the ARS Western Regional Research Center in Albany, California, are putting together pieces of the pathogen puzzle.\nA 1981 food-poisoning incident in Canada, caused by L. monocytogenes in coleslaw, led microbiologist Lisa A. Gorski to study the microbe\u2019s interactions with cabbage. Gorski, with the center\u2019s Produce Safety and Microbiology Research Unit, used advanced techniques not widely available at the time of the cabbage contamination.\n\u201cVery little is known about interactions between Listeria and plants,\u201d says Gorski, whose study revealed the genes that Listeria uses during a successful cabbage-patch invasion.\nThe result was the first-ever documentation of Listeria genes in action on cabbage leaves. Gorski, along with coinvestigator Jeffrey D. Palumbo\u2014now with the center\u2019s Plant Mycotoxin Research Unit\u2014and others, documented the investigation in a 2005 article in Applied and Environmental Microbiology.\nListeria, Behaving Badly\n\u201cPeople had looked at genes that Listeria turns on, or \u2018expresses,\u2019 when it\u2019s grown on agar gel in a laboratory,\u201d says Gorski. \u201cBut no one had looked at genes that Listeria expresses when it grows on a vegetable.\n\u201cWe were surprised to find that when invading cabbage, Listeria calls into play some of the same genes routinely used by microbes that are conventionally associated with plants. Listeria is usually thought of as a pathogen of humans. We hadn\u2019t really expected to see it behaving like a traditional, benign inhabitant of a green plant.\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a relatively new face for Listeria, and requires a whole new way of thinking about it.\u201d\nIn related work, Gorski is homing in on genetic differences that may explain the widely varying ability of eight different Listeria strains to successfully colonize root hairs of alfalfa sprouts\u2014and to resist being washed off by water.\nIn a 2004 article in the Journal of Food Protection, Gorski, Palumbo, and former Albany associate Kimanh D. Nguyen reported those differences. Poorly attaching strains formed fewer than 10 Listeria cells per sprout during the lab experiment, while the more adept colonizers formed more than 100,000 cells per sprout.\nSalmonella\u2019s Cling Genes\nColleague Jeri D. Barak, a microbiologist at Albany, led another sprout investigation, this time probing the ability of S. enterica to attach to alfalfa sprouts. From a pool of 6,000 genetically different Salmonella samples, Barak, Gorski, and coinvestigators found 20 that were unable to attach strongly to sprouts.\nScientists elsewhere had already identified some genes as necessary for Salmonella to successfully invade and attach to the guts of animals such as cows and chickens. In the Albany experiments, some of those same genes were disrupted in the Salmonella specimens that couldn\u2019t cling to alfalfa sprouts.\nTheir 2005 article in Applied and Environmental Microbiology helped set the stage for followup studies to tease out other genes that Salmonella uses when it is living on and in plants.\nA deeper understanding of those and other genes may lead to sophisticated defense strategies to protect tomorrow\u2019s salad greens\u2014and us.\u2014By Marcia Wood, Agricultural Research Service Information Staff.\nGeneticist Michael Cooley collects a sediment sample to test for E. coli O157:H7. The pathogen was found near fields implicated in the 2006 outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 on baby spinach.\nEnvironmental Surveillance Exposes a Killer\nIt started as a manhunt for a microbe, but it became one of the nation\u2019s most intensive farmscape searches for the rogue pathogen E. coli O157:H7.\nARS microbiologist Robert E. Mandrell and geneticist Michael B. Cooley of the Produce Safety and Microbiology Research Unit in Albany, California, had already been collaborating in their own small-scale study of potential sources of E. coli O157:H7 in the state\u2019s produce-rich Salinas Valley when, in 2005, they were asked to join another one. The new investigation became a 19-month surveillance\u2014by the two scientists and other federal and state experts\u2014of E. coli in Salinas Valley watersheds.\n\u201cIt may seem like an obvious concept today,\u201d says Mandrell, \u201cbut at the time, there was little proof that E. coli contamination of produce before harvest could be a major cause of food-poisoning outbreaks.\u201d\nMandrell and Cooley aided the California Food Emergency Response Team, as this food-detective squad was named, in tracing movement of E. coli through the fertile valley. This surveillance showed that E. coli O157:H7 can travel long distances in streamwater and floodwater.\nIn 2006, E. coli O157:H7 strains indistinguishable from those causing human illness associated with baby spinach were discovered in environmental samples\u2014including water\u2014taken from a Salinas Valley ranch.\nWild pigs were added to the list of animal carriers of the pathogen when one of the so-called \u201coutbreak strains\u201d of E. coli O157:H7 was discovered in their dung. The team documented its work in 2007 in PLoS ONE and Emerging Infectious Diseases.\nThe Albany scientists used a relatively new technique to detect E. coli O157:H7 in water. Developed at the ARS Meat Animal Research Center in Clay Center, Nebraska, for animal hides, the method was adapted by the Albany team for the outdoor reconnaissance.\nBecause of their colleagues\u2019 work, says Cooley, \u201cWe had the right method at the right time.\u201d\u2014By Marcia Wood, Agricultural Research Service Information Staff.\n\"Outmaneuvering Foodborne Pathogens\" was published in the July 2008 issue of Agricultural Research magazine.","id":"<urn:uuid:b366eb1a-184b-4885-b5a6-92a6d0c0f67f>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.ars.usda.gov\/is\/AR\/archive\/jul08\/pathogen0708.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9299995303,"token_count":3794,"score":3.078125,"int_score":3}

{"text":"The Independent Jane\nFor all the love, romance and scandal in Jane Austen\u2019s books, what they are really about is freedom and independence. Independence of thought and the freedom to choose.\nElizabeth\u2019s refusal of Mr. Collins offer of marriage showed an independence seldom seen in heroines of the day. Her refusal of Mr. Darcy while triggered by anger showed a level of independence that left him shocked and stunned.\nThe freedom she exhibited in finally accepting him in direct defiance of Lady Catherine and knowing her father would disapprove was unusual even for Austen. In her last book Anne Elliot is persuaded to refuse Captain Wentworth at Lady Russel\u2019s insistence.\nAlthough Jane played by the rules of the day, all of her writing is infused with how she wanted life to be. She \u2018screams\u2019 her outrage at the limitations for women in Emma.\nWhen accosted by Mrs. Elton, Jane Fairfax says,\n\u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no inquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends. When I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid of being long unemployed. There are places in town, offices, where inquiry would soon produce something \u2014 offices for the sale, not quite of human flesh, but of human intellect.\u201d\n\u201cOh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean a fling at the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition.\u201d\n\u201cI did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,\u201d replied Jane; \u201cgoverness-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view; widely different certainly, as to the guilt of those who carry it on; but as to the greater misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies.\u201d\nThat same sentiment is emphasized in Emma\u2019s shock when Mrs. Weston tells her of Frank Churchill\u2019s secret engagement to Jane.\n\u201cGood God!\u201d cried Emma, \u201cJane actually on the point of going as governess! What could he mean by such horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage herself \u2014 to suffer her even to think of such a measure!\u201d\nI find it interesting that at the moment of Austen\u2019s birth or there about, John Adams left his farm in Massachusetts for the Continental Congress in Philadelphia. Doesn\u2019t sound particularly interesting, I know but consider this.\nJohn Adams left his home in mid-December 1775 to attend an unprecedented meeting of colonial representatives to consider severing ties with their mother country and her monarch; a decision that culminated in a document unlike any ever written. In the mother country, one day in that same cold December a baby girl was born at Steventon Rectory. Her cry was heard by only the people in the house but the years to come would see her pen create works unlike any the world had ever seen.\nComparing Austen\u2019s words with Thomas Jefferson\u2019s may seem a trivialization but I believe that Austen\u2019s impact on the world is no less important than Jefferson\u2019s. The effect of Jane\u2019s writing maybe more subtle than that of the Virginian but it is no less influential.\nJefferson\u2019s words instigated and promoted a revolution, a war of independence. Jane\u2019s words had no such excessive consequence. Still in her own quiet, genteel yet powerful way she declared and promoted the same principles of freedom and self-regulated independence as our American forefathers. In all her novels Jane advocates independence of person and thought, the rights of all and acceptance of responsibility for those rights.\nJane may not have incited military action as Jefferson did but even as an avowed royalist, I doubt not that Jane Austen firmly believed in his declaration of the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.","id":"<urn:uuid:0d8a309d-25c5-405d-a08a-c11239f0d717>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/austenauthors.net\/the-independent-jane","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9743200541,"token_count":845,"score":2.75,"int_score":3}

Bill McGuire, professor of geophysical and climate hazards at University College London, expects our continued rise in greenhouse gas emissions to awaken a slumbering giant: the Earth's crust. In Waking the Giant: How a Changing Climate Triggers Earthquakes, Tsunamis and Volcanoes (Oxford University Press), he explains that when the Earth's crust (or geosphere) becomes disrupted from rising temperatures and a C[O.sub.2]-rich atmosphere, natural disasters strike more frequently and with catastrophic force.\nApplying a \"straightforward presentation of what we know about how climate and the geosphere interact,\" the book links previous warming periods 20,000 to 5,000 years ago with a greater abundance of tsunamis, landslides, seismic activity and volcanic eruptions.

{"text":"What is Rainwater Harvesting?\nRainwater harvesting is an ancient practice of catching and holding rain for later use. In a rainwater harvesting system, rain is gathered from a building rooftop or other source and is held in large containers for future use, such as watering gardens or washing cars. This practice reduces the demand on water resources and is excellent during times of drought.\nWhy is it Important?\nIn addition to reducing the demand on our water sources (especially important during drought), rainwater harvesting also helps prevent water pollution. Surprised?\nHere\u2019s why: the success of the 1972 Clean Water Act has meant that the greatest threat to New York\u2019s waterbodies comes not from industrial sources, but rather through the small actions we all make in our daily lives. For example, in a rain storm, the oil, pesticides, animal waste, and litter from our lawns, sidewalks, driveways, and streets are washed down into our sewers. This is called non-point source (NPS) pollution because the pollutants come from too many sources to be identified. Rainwater harvesting diverts water from becoming polluted stormwater; instead, this captured rainwater may be used to irrigate gardens near where it falls.\nIn New York City, keeping rainwater out of the sewer system is very important. That\u2019s because the city has an old combined sewer system that uses the same pipes to transport both household waste and stormwater to sewage treatment plants. During heavy rains, the system overloads; then untreated sewage and contaminated stormwater overflow into our rivers and estuary, with serious consequences:\nWho is Harvesting Rainwater in New York City?\nBack in 2002, a drought emergency pushed many community gardens to the brink of extinction. For the first time in twenty years, community gardeners were denied permission to use fire hydrants, the primary source of water for most community gardens. This crisis led to the formation of the Water Resources Group (WRG), an open collaboration of community gardening and environmental organizations. With help from the WRG, rainwater harvesting systems have now been built as demonstration sites in twenty NYC community gardens.\nAt community gardens that harvest rainwater, rain is diverted from the gutters of adjacent buildings and is stored in tanks in the gardens. A 1-inch rainfall on a 1,000-square-foot roof produces 600 gallons of water. The tanks are mosquito proof, so the standing water does not encourage West Nile virus. Because rainwater is chlorine free, it is better than tap water for plant growth, meaning healthier plants. And it\u2019s free!\nWhat are Other Cities Doing?\nMany cities have adopted creative, low-cost ways to stop wasting rainwater by diverting it from their sewage systems and putting it to use where it falls. Here are some examples:\nWhat Can I Do?\nSpread the word! Educate those around you on the importance of lifestyle decisions.\nTell people not to litter, dump oil down storm drains, or overfertilize their lawns.\nInstall a rainwater harvesting system at your home, school, business, or local community center.\nContact your local elected officials, and let them know you support rainwater harvesting!\nSupporting rainwater harvesting Jade Boat Loans","id":"<urn:uuid:14a860e9-8430-426b-8c1a-80c7f022fb96>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.waterresourcesgroup.org\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9423009157,"token_count":671,"score":3.890625,"int_score":4}

{"text":"Inspecting Heating Systems & Carbon Monoxide\nCarbon monoxide poisoning has been on the rise in recent years, and it stems in large part from the home\u2019s heating system. At first glance, modern heating systems may seem the same as those that have been used safely for years. However, there are some key differences that make today\u2019s homes more susceptible to carbon monoxide buildup. As a home inspector, it is important to understand heating systems, what causes toxic gases to be present in the home, and how to prevent it.\nIn a nutshell, toxic gases in the home can be attributed to the following common situations:\n- Today\u2019s houses are more air-tight. Homeowners are aware of the cost of heating drafty homes and take steps to seal up windows, doors and other areas of air-infiltration. Consequently, there is less fresh air coming into a home and not as many pathways for stale or polluted air to leave it. In addition, when furnaces and boilers are starved for of the oxygen needed to burn fuels completely, carbon monoxide is produced.\n- Manufacturers have designed new, high technology heating appliances with greater efficiency to help us save money, conserve natural resources and decrease environmental pollution. However, the new breed of high efficiency gas and oil furnaces- when vented into existing chimney flues- often do not perform at an optimum level. The difference in performance creates conditions that allow toxic gases to enter living spaces more easily.\nThe above conditions point out a number of older, ongoing problems that still require detection by a professional home inspector as well as correction in order to prevent toxic gases from filtering into the house. These include damaged or deteriorating flue liners, soot build-up, debris clogging the passageway, and animal or bird nests obstructing chimney flues.\nWhat can you tell your home inspection clients about preventing these problems from arising? AHIT recommends that heating systems be tuned-up on an annual basis by a qualified HVAC contractor and that chimneys\/flues be evaluated by a Certified Chimney Sweeper to ensure the entire system is operating properly and safely.\nReference material provided by the CSIA.\nBack to Home Inspection Industry News >>","id":"<urn:uuid:f446189b-fb4b-4d49-a4e4-daed9cffb0d0>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.ahit.com\/news\/Inspecting-Heating-Systems-CO.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9488449097,"token_count":461,"score":2.5625,"int_score":3}

If that's true, the record would be the 134, reached nine years earlier in Death Valley, California.\nBut the world's hottest place might not be any of these, according to a team of scientists from the University of Montana. It says the highest temperatures on Earth are found in areas that don't even have weather stations.\n\"The Earth's hot deserts -- such as the Sahara, the Gobi, the Sonoran and the Lut -- are climatically harsh and so remote that access for routine measurements and maintenance of a weather station is impractical,\" said David Mildrexler, lead author of a recent study that used NASA satellites to detect the Earth's hottest surface temperatures.\nThe satellites detect the infrared energy emitted by land. And over a seven-year period, from 2003 to 2009, they found Iran's Lut Desert to be the hottest place on Earth.\nThe Lut Desert had the highest recorded surface temperature in five of the seven years, topping out at 159 degrees in 2005. Other notable annual highs came from Queensland, Australia (156 degrees in 2003) and China's Turpan Basin (152 degrees in 2008).\nIt's important to stress that surface temperatures are naturally higher than the air temperatures measured by weather stations. Air temperatures have to be measured by thermometers placed off the ground and shielded from sunlight, according to global meteorological standards.\nBut the study shows that today's modern records might not necessarily be the most accurate.\n\"Most of the places that call themselves the hottest on Earth are not even serious contenders,\" co-author Steve Running said.\nThe world's highest recorded air temperatures 1.

{"text":"Taking Play Seriously\nBy ROBIN MARANTZ HENIG\nPublished: February 17, 2008\nOn a drizzly Tuesday night in late January, 200 people came out to hear a psychiatrist talk rhapsodically about play -- not just the intense, joyous play of children, but play for all people, at all ages, at all times. (All species too; the lecture featured touching photos of a polar bear and a husky engaging playfully at a snowy outpost in northern Canada.) Stuart Brown, president of the National Institute for Play, was speaking at the New York Public Library's main branch on 42nd Street. He created the institute in 1996, after more than 20 years of psychiatric practice and research persuaded him of the dangerous long-term consequences of play deprivation. In a sold-out talk at the library, he and Krista Tippett, host of the public-radio program ''Speaking of Faith,'' discussed the biological and spiritual underpinnings of play. Brown called play part of the ''developmental sequencing of becoming a human primate. If you look at what produces learning and memory and well-being, play is as fundamental as any other aspect of life, including sleep and dreams.''\nThe message seemed to resonate with audience members, who asked anxious questions about what seemed to be the loss of play in their children's lives. Their concern came, no doubt, from the recent deluge of eulogies to play . Educators fret that school officials are hacking away at recess to make room for an increasingly crammed curriculum. Psychologists complain that overscheduled kids have no time left for the real business of childhood: idle, creative, unstructured free play. Public health officials link insufficient playtime to a rise in childhood obesity. Parents bemoan the fact that kids don't play the way they themselves did -- or think they did. And everyone seems to worry that without the chance to play stickball or hopscotch out on the street, to play with dolls on the kitchen floor or climb trees in the woods, today's children are missing out on something essential.\nThe success of ''The Dangerous Book for Boys'' -- which has been on the best-seller list for the last nine months -- and its step-by-step instructions for activities like folding paper airplanes is testament to the generalized longing for play's good old days. So were the questions after Stuart Brown's library talk; one woman asked how her children will learn trust, empathy and social skills when their most frequent playing is done online. Brown told her that while video games do have some play value, a true sense of ''interpersonal nuance'' can be achieved only by a child who is engaging all five senses by playing in the three-dimensional world.\nThis is part of a larger conversation Americans are having about play. Parents bobble between a nostalgia-infused yearning for their children to play and fear that time spent playing is time lost to more practical pursuits. Alarming headlines about U.S. students falling behind other countries in science and math, combined with the ever-more-intense competition to get kids into college, make parents rush to sign up their children for piano lessons and test-prep courses instead of just leaving them to improvise on their own; playtime versus r?m?uilding.\nDiscussions about play force us to reckon with our underlying ideas about childhood, sex differences, creativity and success. Do boys play differently than girls? Are children being damaged by staring at computer screens and video games? Are they missing something when fantasy play is populated with characters from Hollywood's imagination and not their own? Most of these issues are too vast to be addressed by a single field of study (let alone a magazine article). But the growing science of play does have much to add to the conversation. Armed with research grounded in evolutionary biology and experimental neuroscience, some scientists have shown themselves eager -- at times perhaps a little too eager -- to promote a scientific argument for play. They have spent the past few decades learning how and why play evolved in animals, generating insights that can inform our understanding of its evolution in humans too. They are studying, from an evolutionary perspective, to what extent play is a luxury that can be dispensed with when there are too many other competing claims on the growing brain, and to what extent it is central to how that brain grows in the first place.\nScientists who study play, in animals and humans alike, are developing a consensus view that play is something more than a way for restless kids to work off steam; more than a way for chubby kids to burn off calories; more than a frivolous luxury. Play, in their view, is a central part of neurological growth and development -- one important way that children build complex, skilled, responsive, socially adept and cognitively flexible brains.\nTheir work still leaves some questions unanswered, including questions about play's darker, more ambiguous side: is there really an evolutionary or developmental need for dangerous games, say, or for the meanness and hurt feelings that seem to attend so much child's play? Answering these and other questions could help us understand what might be lost if children play less.","id":"<urn:uuid:316c7af5-14e1-4d0b-9576-753e17ef2cc5>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9404E7DA1339F934A25751C0A96E9C8B63&scp=2&sq=taking%20play%20seriously&st=cse","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9614589214,"token_count":1055,"score":2.5625,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Glasses-free 3D is something available on just a handful of TVs, which manage it only through complicated hardware, and at no small cost.\nStill, the effect is pretty smooth and no more tiresome for the eyes than glasses-assisted technology, from what we've been able to gather.\nThere is one more accomplishment that tech experts are looking for: holographic television, which offers a different perspective at the action, depending on the angle from which one beholds the TV.\nResearchers from the Massachusetts institute of Technology (MIT) claim to have created something of the sort.\nCalled Tensor Display, it uses several layers of liquid crystal displays (LCDs) with a refresh rate of 360 Hz per second.\nThe technique is different from the one used in Nintendo's 3DS\n, which has two layers of LCD screens (the bottom for light and dark bands and the top for the two slightly offset images).\nThe problem with this old method (a century old really) is that the only way so far known for creating multiple perspectives would rely on complicated hardware and algorithms. Hundreds of perspectives would have to be produced in order to suit a moving viewer, and that means that too much info has to be displayed at once.\nEvery frame of the stereo-3D video would need the screen to flicker 10 times, each with a different pattern. Thus, a convincing stereo-3D illusion would need a 1,000 Hz refresh rate.\nMIT's Tensor Display lowers that requirement by using a higher number of LCDs, although it does bring another problem: the pattern calculation becomes more complex. Fortunately, the researcher had a convenient factor to exploit: not all aspects of a scene change with the viewing angle. This reduced the amount of information that needed to be sent to the LCD screens.\nThe end result was a panel that produces stereo-3D images based on calculations similar to those behind CT, X-ray and computed tomography, of all things (they produce 3D images of internal organs).\nThe Media Lab researchers will demo a Tensor Display prototype at Siggraph 2012 (5-9 August), made of three LCD panels. A second model will have two LCDs with a sheet of lenses between them (refract light left and right), primarily for wider viewing angles (50 degrees rather than 20).\nPractical and commercial applications should appear soon, or at least sooner than any alternatives.\n\u201cHolography works, it\u2019s beautiful, nothing can touch its quality. The problem, of course, is that holograms don\u2019t move,\u201d said\nDouglas Lanman, a postdoc at the Media Lab.\n\u201cTo make them move, you need to create a hologram in real time, and to do that, you need little tiny pixels, smaller than anything we can build at large volume at low cost. So the question is, what do we have now? We have LCDs. They are incredibly mature, and they are cheap.\u201d","id":"<urn:uuid:efffa1be-d968-41f5-b3e7-ddb772865645>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/news.softpedia.com\/news\/MIT-Creates-New-Glasses-Free-Stereo-3D-TV-Technology-281825.shtml","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9489791393,"token_count":619,"score":2.734375,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Flipping the North Koreans off\nNot many people visit North korea these days but if you are one of the lucky few, more likely than not you will be led through an official guided tour of USS Pueblo \u2013 an American Intelligence vessel captured in 1968 \u2013 which remains the only American vessel currently in captivity.\nThe seizure of USS Pueblo is now one of the forgotten episodes of the Cold War. The U.S. claimed it was in the international waters, while the D.P.R.K. insisted that it was in the North Korean waters. Diplomatic and military stand-off that followed was punctuated by a series of photos, films, and letters depicting the crew of the Pueblo enjoying their comfortable captivity.\nIn reality, however, the crew was being subjected to psychical and psychological abuse. From behind the bars in one of the most isolated places on the planet, the crew nonetheless delivered a master class in political subversion. To undermine the credibility of the letters written home to suggest that they had willingly defected, the crew wrote about the events that never happened. In their press conferences, they used archaic words the Koreans didn\u2019t perfectly understand. Since none of the Koreans knew English well enough to write the confession, the vessel\u2019s commander wrote it himself. They checked the meaning of his words with a dictionary, but failed to catch the pun: \u201cWe paean the DPRK. We paean the Korean people. We paean their great leader Kim Il Sung\u201d. (\u201cPaean\u201d is homophonic with \u201cpee on\u201d.)\nAnd almost by accident, they came across the idea behind their greatest coup: in two propaganda movies, the crew noticed people giving the finger were not censored. The crew deduced that the North Koreans didn\u2019t know what the finger meant. In the subsequent propaganda photos of the crew, their middle fingers were firmly extended to the cameraman. When the North Koreans questioned, the crew described it as the \u201cHawaiian good luck sign.\u201d The ruse went on unnoticed until October 1968, when Time magazine explained the mysterious gesture appearing in many photos as one of \u201cobscene derisiveness and contempt.\u201d\nThis revelation infuriated the North Korean captors, bringing about a period of severe beatings and torture, and the propaganda letters, photos and videos stopped after this. Yet, it would take two more months for the U.S. to offer a perfunctory apology (retracted afterwards) to ensure the release of 82 crewmen. Diplomatic and morale victory hid the bitter reality that the loss of USS Pueblo was a significant blow to the intelligence services. It is now believed that the Soviets urged the North Koreans to seize the ship so that they can reverse engineer US equipment and codebooks.\nTime Magazine never responded to the repercussions that followed its very public explanation, which in its entirely is reproduced below.

{"text":"The Matter at Issue: The Throne of France\nThe Hundred Years War was fought largely over who would be the king of France. The English kings, who had originally been French nobles that invaded and conquered England in 1066, still held lands in France. The English lands in France had long been viewed uncomfortably by the French king. Through the 13th century, strong French kings had reclaimed French lands held by the English kings. By the early 14th century, three events came together. First, the English kings noted that one more push by the French would deive the English completely out of France. Second, the French were entering a period of weak kings. Third, the English throne was now occupied by the young, vigorous, able and (ultimately) long lived Edward III. In any other circumstances it would appear absurd for the English king to come up with the idea of claiming the French throne in order to protect English lands in France. But Edward III was bold and, in one of those uniquely Medieval ironies, he had law and custom on his side. The English claim to the French throne was strong, as were the English armies and Edward IIIs resolve. The resulting war outlived Edward, and his great grandson, Henry V, came within a hair of actually taking the French throne.\nThe items below explain the situation in rather more detail.\nHistorical Kings of France\nHistorical Kings of England\nThe English Position of the Throne of France\nThe French Ultimatum\nA Summary of Overlapping Claims to Various Thrones","id":"<urn:uuid:1f4f86d3-c09c-44ad-95d3-340f176f8e84>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.hyw.com\/books\/history\/France__.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9842460752,"token_count":313,"score":3.84375,"int_score":4}

The centerpiece of the autumn sky is a starry square called the Great Square of Pegasus. In mid-October it lies almost overhead from mid-northern latitudes around 10 pm.\nPegasus was the winged horse of Greek mythology, and the Great Square represents the front half of the body of Pegasus. Four stars mark the corners of the Square, boxing in an area of sky so large that you need to hold both hands out at arm\u00eds length to cover it. Sports fans in North America might think of it as a baseball diamond rather than a square.\nYou should be able to find the Square without much difficulty, but your star chart can help if you need to orient yourself. (For help, see \"Absolute Beginners \u0116 Start Observing.\" There is a link at the end of this article.)\nLooking at the Square, imagine a line from the right-hand side of the square down towards the southern horizon and you\u00edll come to a bright star called Fomalhaut. Fomalhaut is part of the constellation of Piscis Austrinus, the southern fish. In 2008, astronomers released photographs taken by the Hubble Space Telescope showing a planet in orbit around Fomalhaut.\nReturning to the Square, imagine a line upwards from the left side. This will lead you to the W-shaped constellation of Cassiopeia, one of the easiest star patterns to recognize. Continue the line northwards for the same distance to see the north pole star, Polaris.\nAlthough astronomers talk of the Great Square of Pegasus, these days only three of its stars officially belong to that constellation. In ancient times, one star was shared with neighboring Andromeda, marking her head. When, in 1930, astronomers came to define official boundaries for the constellations, they ended the practice of sharing stars. Andromeda kept her head but Pegasus lost a corner of its square.\nAndromeda represents the unfortunate daughter of Queen Cassiopeia. She was chained to a rock in sacrifice to a sea monster to atone for the sins of her boastful mother. However, you\u00edll need a good imagination to see Andromeda as more than a couple of crooked lines of stars leading away from the upper left corner of the Great Square.\nThere is, though, one great treasure to be found in the constellation. Two lines extend from the Square. Look at the more prominent of the two lines. If you count two stars along and then go two stars up, you\u00edll come to it: the Andromeda Galaxy, a spiral of stars 2.5 million light years away. On clear dark nights you can glimpse the Andromeda Galaxy with the unaided eye as a hazy wisp of light. The Andromeda Galaxy is the most distant object you can see without optical aid, but it\u00eds more prominent through binoculars and small telescopes.\nBeyond the shackled feet of Andromeda lies her heroic rescuer, Perseus. This constellation is shaped rather like a distorted capital A. In the sky he is depicted holding the severed head of Medusa the Gorgon, marked by the star Algol. Click for a diagram of the constellation Perseus. Perseus lies in a rich part of the Milky Way, so if you sweep over this area with binoculars, sparkling star fields will spring into view.\nBeyond Perseus the stars of winter lie in wait, but we\u00edll leave these for another time and return again to our starting point, the Square of Pegasus. Near it lie two well-known, but relatively inconspicuous constellations, of the zodiac. They are Aquarius the water carrier and Pisces the fishes.\nThe stars of Pisces are arranged in a large, faint V-shape below and to the left of the Great Square. The most distinctive feature of Pisces is the Circlet, a ring of stars directly beneath the Square of Pegasus, representing the body of one of the two fish visualized here by ancient astronomers.\nBelow and to the right of the Circlet of Pisces lies Aquarius. This constellation\u00eds most distinctive feature is a trefoil-shaped group of four stars that marks the water carrier\u00eds jar. From the jar, a stream of faint stars cascades down towards bright Fomalhaut.\nThe Monthly Sky Guide, by Ian Ridpath and Wil Tirion\nContent copyright \u00a9 2013 by Mona Evans.

{"text":"October 2004 | Volume 55, Issue 5\nAs America goes into its fifty-fifth presidential election, we should remember that there might have been only one\u2014if we hadn\u2019t had the only candidate on earth who could do the job\nLooking back over two hundred years of the American Presidency, it seems safe to say that no one entered the office with more personal prestige than Washington, and only two Presidents\u2014Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt\u2014faced comparable crises. The Civil War and the Great Depression, though now distant in time, remain more recent and raw in our collective memory than the American founding, so we find it easier to appreciate the achievements of Lincoln and Roosevelt. Washington\u2019s achievement must be recovered before it can be appreciated, which means that we must recognize that there was no such thing as a viable American nation when he took office as President, that the opening words of the Constitution (\u201cWe the people of the United States\u201d) expressed a fervent but fragile hope rather than a social reality. The roughly four million settlers spread along the coastline and streaming over the Alleghenies felt their primary allegiance\u2014to the extent they felt any allegiance at all \u2014to local, state, and regional authorities. No republican government had ever before exercised control over a population this diffuse or a land this large, and the prevailing assumption among the best-informed European observers was that, to paraphrase Lincoln\u2019s later formulation, a nation so conceived and so dedicated could not endure.\nNot much happened at the Executive level during the first year of Washington\u2019s Presidency, which was exactly the way he wanted it. His official correspondence was dominated by job applications from veterans of the war, former friends, and total strangers. They all received the same republican response\u2014namely, that merit rather than favoritism must determine federal appointments. As for the President himself, it was not clear whether he was taking the helm or merely occupying the bridge. Rumors began to circulate that he regarded his role as primarily ceremonial and symbolic, that after a mere two years he intended to step down, having launched the American ship of state and contributed his personal prestige as ballast on its maiden voyage.\nAs it turned out, even ceremonial occasions raised troubling questions because no one knew how the symbolic centerpiece of a republic should behave or even what to call him. Vice President John Adams, trying to be helpful, ignited a fiery debate in the Senate by suggesting such regal titles as \u201cHis Elective Majesty\u201d and \u201cHis Mightiness,\u201d which provoked a lethal combination of shock and laughter, as well as the observation that Adams himself should be called \u201cHis Rotundity.\u201d Eventually the Senate resolved on the most innocuous option available: The President of the United States should be called exactly that. Matters of social etiquette\u2014how the President should interact with the public, where he should be accessible and where insulated\u2014prompted multiple memorandums on the importance of what Alexander Hamilton called \u201ca pretty high tone\u201d that stopped short of secluding the President entirely. The solution was a weekly open house called the levee, part imperial court ceremony with choreographed bows and curtsies, part drop-in parlor social. The levee struck the proper middle note between courtly formality and republican simplicity, though at the expense of becoming a notoriously boring and wholly scripted occasion.\nThe very awkwardness of the levee fitted Washington\u2019s temperament nicely since he possessed a nearly preternatural ability to remain silent while everyone around him was squirming under the pressure to fill that silence with conversation. (Adams later claimed that this \u201cgift of silence\u201d was Washington\u2019s greatest political asset, which Adams deeply envied because he lacked it altogether.) The formal etiquette of the levee and Washington\u2019s natural dignity (or was it aloofness?) combined to create a political atmosphere unimaginable in any modern-day national capital. In a year when the French Revolution broke out in violent spasms destined to reshape the entire political landscape of Europe, and the new Congress ratified a Bill of Rights that codified the most sweeping guarantee of individual freedoms ever enacted, no one at the levees expected Washington to comment on those events.\nEven matters of etiquette and symbolism, however, could have constitutional consequences, as Washington learned in August of 1789. The treaty-making power of the President required that he seek \u201cthe Advice and Consent of the Senate.\u201d Washington initially interpreted the phrase to require his personal appearance in the Senate and the solicitation of senatorial opinion on specific treaty provisions in the mode of a large advisory council. But when he brought his proposals for treaties with several Southern Indian tribes to the Senate, the debate became a prolonged shouting match over questions of procedure. The longer the debate went on, the more irritated Washington became. Finally he declared, \u201cThis defeats every purpose of my coming here,\u201d and abruptly stalked out. From that time on, the phrase advice and consent meant something less than direct Executive solicitation of senatorial opinion, and the role of the Senate as an equal partner in the Grafting of treaties came to be regarded as a violation of the separation-of-powers principle.\nThough he never revisited the Senate, Washington did honor his pledge to visit all the states in the Union. In the fall of 1789 he set off on a tour of New England that carried him through 60 towns and hamlets. Everywhere he went, the residents turned out in droves to glimpse America\u2019s greatest hero parading past. And everywhere he went, New Englanders became Americans. Since Rhode Island had not yet ratified the Constitution, he skipped it, then made a separate trip the following summer to welcome the proudly independent latecomer into the new nation. During a visit to the Jewish synagogue in Newport he published an address on religious freedom that turned out to be the most uncompromising endorsement of the principle he ever made. (One must say \u201cmade\u201d rather than \u201cwrote\u201d because there is considerable evidence that Thomas Jefferson wrote it.) Whatever sectional suspicions New Englanders might harbor toward that faraway thing called the federal government, when it appeared in their neighborhoods in the form of George Washington, they saluted, cheered, toasted, and embraced it as their own.\nThe Southern tour was a more grueling affair, covering nearly 2,000 miles during the spring of 1791. Instead of regarding it as a threat to his health, however, Washington described it as a tonic; the real risk, he believed, was the sedentary life of a deskbound President. The entourage of 11 horses included his white parade steed, Prescott, whom he mounted at the edge of each town in order to make an entrance that accorded with the heroic mythology already surrounding his military career. Prescott\u2019s hooves were painted and polished before each appearance, and Washington usually brought along his favorite greyhound, mischievously named Cornwallis, to add to the dramatic effect. Like a modern political candidate on the campaign trail, Washington made speeches at each stop that repeated the same platitudinous themes, linking the glory of the War for Independence with the latent glory of the newly established United States. The ladies of Charleston fluttered alongside their fans when Washington took the dance floor; Prescott and the four carriage horses held up despite the nearly impassable or even nonexistent roads; Cornwallis, however, wore out and was buried on the banks of the Savannah River in a brick vault with a marble tombstone that local residents maintained for decades as a memorial to his master\u2019s visit. In the end all the states south of the Potomac could say they had seen the palpable version of the flag, Washington himself.\nDuring the Southern tour one of the earliest editorial criticisms of Washington\u2019s embodiment of authority appeared in the press. He was being treated at each stop like a canonized American saint, the editorial complained, or perhaps like a demigod \u201cperfumed by the incense of addresses.\u201d The complaint harked back to the primordial fear haunting all republics: \u201cHowever highly we may consider the character of the Chief Magistrate of the Union, yet we cannot but think the fashionable mode of expressing our attachment... favors too much of Monarchy to be used by Republicans, or to be received with pleasure by the President of a Commonwealth.\u201d\nSuch doubts were rarely uttered publicly during the initial years of Washington\u2019s Presidency. But they lurked in the background, exposing how double-edged the political imperatives of the American Revolution had become. To secure the revolutionary legacy on the national level required a person who embodied national authority more visibly than any collective body like Congress could convey. Washington had committed himself to playing that role by accepting the Presidency. But at the core of the Revolutionary legacy lay a deep suspicion of any potent projection of political power by a \u201csingular figure.\u201d And since the very idea of a republican Chief Executive was a novelty, there was no vocabulary for characterizing such a creature except the verbal tradition surrounding European courts and kings. By playing the part he believed history required, Washington made himself vulnerable to the most virulent apprehensions about monarchical power.\nHe could credibly claim to be the only person who had earned the right to be trusted with power. He could also argue, as he did to several friends throughout his first term, that no man was more eager for retirement, that he sincerely resented the obligations of his office as it spread a lengthening shadow of public responsibility over his dwindling days on earth. If critics wished to whisper behind his back that he looked too regal riding a white stallion with a leopard-skin cloth and gold-rimmed saddle, so be it. He knew he would rather be at Mount Vernon. In the meantime he would play his assigned role as America\u2019s presiding presence: as so many toasts in his honor put it, \u201cthe man who unites all hearts.\u201d\nExercising Executive authority called for completely different talents than symbolizing it. Washington\u2019s administrative style had evolved through decades of experience as master of Mount Vernon and commander of the Continental Army. (In fact, he had fewer subordinates to supervise as President than he had had in those earlier jobs.) The Cabinet system he installed represented a civilian adaptation of his military staff, with Executive sessions of the Cabinet resembling the councils of war that had provided collective wisdom during crises. As Thomas Jefferson later described it, Washington made himself \u201cthe hub of the wheel,\u201d with routine business delegated to the department heads at the rim. It was a system that maximized Executive control while also creating essential distance from details. Its successful operation depended upon two skills that Washington had developed over his lengthy career: first, identifying and recruiting talented and ambitious young men, usually possessing formal education superior to his own, then trusting them with considerable responsibility and treating them as surrogate sons in his official family; second, knowing when to remain the hedgehog who keeps his distance and when to become the fox who dives into the details.\nOn the first score, as a judge of talent, Washington surrounded himself with the most intellectually sophisticated collection of statesmen in American history. His first recruit, James Madison, became his most trusted consultant on judicial and Executive appointments and his unofficial liaison with Congress. The precocious Virginian was then at the peak of his powers, having just completed a remarkable string of triumphs as the dominant force behind the nationalist agenda at the Constitutional Convention and the Virginia ratifying convention, as well as being co-author of The Federalist Papers . From his position in the House of Representatives he drafted the address welcoming Washington to the Presidency, then drafted Washington\u2019s response to it, making him a one-man shadow government. Soon after the inaugural ceremony he showed Washington his draft of 12 amendments to the Constitution, subsequently reduced to 10 and immortalized as the Bill of Rights. Washington approved the historic proposal without changing a word and trusted Madison to usher it through Congress with his customary proficiency.\nOne of Madison\u2019s early assignments was to persuade his reluctant friend from Monticello to serve as Secretary of State. Thomas Jefferson combined nearly spotless Revolutionary credentials with five years of diplomatic experience in Paris, all buoyed by a lyrical way with words and ideas most famously displayed in his draft of the Declaration of Independence.\nAlexander Hamilton was the third member of this talented trinity and probably the brightest of the lot. While Madison and Jefferson had come up through the Virginia school of politics, which put a premium on an understated style that emphasized indirection and stealth, Hamilton had come out of nowhere (actually, impoverished origins in the Caribbean) to display a dashing, out-of-my-way style that imposed itself ostentatiously. As Washington\u2019s aide-de-camp during the war, he had occasionally shown himself to be a headstrong surrogate son, always searching for an independent command beyond Washington\u2019s shadow. But his loyalty to his mentor was unquestioned, and his affinity for the way he thought was unequaled. Moreover, throughout the 1780s Hamilton had been the chief advocate for fiscal reform as the essential prerequisite for an energetic national government, making him the obvious choice as Secretary of Treasury once Robert Morris had declined.\nThe inner circle was rounded out by three appointments of slightly lesser luster. Gen. Henry Knox, appointed Secretary of War, had served alongside Washington from Boston to Yorktown and had long since learned to subsume his own personality so thoroughly within his chief\u2019s that disagreements became virtually impossible. More than just a cipher, as some critics of Washington\u2019s policies later claimed, Knox joined Vice President Adams as a seasoned New England voice within the councils of power. John Jay, the new Chief Justice, added New York\u2019s most distinguished legal and political mind to the mix, and also extensive foreign policy experience. As the first Attorney General, Edmund Randolph lacked Jay\u2019s gravitas and Knox\u2019s experience, but his reputation for endless vacillation was offset by solid political connections within the Tidewater elite, reinforced by an impeccable bloodline. Washington\u2019s judgment of the assembled team was unequivocal. \u201cI feel myself supported by able co-adjutors,\u201d he observed in June of 1790, \u201cwho harmonize extremely well together.\u201d\nIn three significant areas of domestic policy, each loaded with explosive political and constitutional implications, Washington chose to delegate nearly complete control to his \u201cco-adjutors.\u201d Although his reasons for maintaining a discreet distance differed in each case, they all reflected his recognition that Executive power still lived under a monarchical cloud of suspicion and could be exercised only selectively. Much like his Fabian role during the war, when he learned to avoid an all-or-nothing battle with the British, choosing when to avoid conflict struck him as the essence of effective Executive leadership.\nThe first battle he evaded focused on the shape and powers of the federal courts. The Constitution offered even less guidance on the judiciary than it did on the Executive branch. Once again the studied ambiguity reflected apprehension about any projection of federal power that upset the compromise between state and federal sovereignty. Washington personally preferred a unified body of national law, regarding it as a crucial step in creating what the Constitution called \u201ca more perfect union.\u201d In nominating Jay to head the Supreme Court, he argued that the federal judiciary \u201cmust be considered as the Key-Stone of our political fabric\u201d since a coherent court system that tied the states and regions together with the ligaments of law would achieve more in the way of national unity than any other possible reform.\nBut that, of course, was also the reason it proved so controversial. The debate over the Judiciary Act of 1789 exposed the latent hostility toward any consolidated court system. The act created a six-member Supreme Court, 3 circuit courts, and 13 district courts but left questions of original or appellate jurisdiction intentionally blurred so as to conciliate the advocates of state sovereignty. Despite his private preferences, Washington deferred to the tradeoffs worked out in congressional committees, chiefly a committee chaired by Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut, which designed a framework of overlapping authorities that was neither rational nor wholly national in scope. In subsequent decades John Marshall, Washington\u2019s most loyal and influential disciple, would move this ambiguous arrangement toward a more coherent version of national law. But throughout Washington\u2019s Presidency the one thing the Supreme Court could not be, or appear to be, was supreme, a political reality that Washington chose not to contest.\nA second occasion for calculated Executive reticence occurred in February of 1790 when the forbidden subject of slavery came before Congress. Two Quaker petitions, one arguing for an immediate end to the slave trade, the other advocating the gradual abolition of slavery itself, provoked a bitter debate in the House. The petitions would almost surely have been consigned to legislative oblivion except for the signature of Benjamin Franklin on the second one, which transformed a beyond-the-pale protest into an unavoidable challenge to debate the moral compatibility of slavery with America\u2019s avowed Revolutionary principles. In what turned out to be his last public act, Franklin was investing his enormous prestige to force the first public discussion of the sectional differences over slavery at the national level. (The debates at the Constitutional Convention had occurred behind closed doors, and their records remained sealed.) If only in retrospect, the discussions in the House during the spring of 1790 represented the Revolutionary generation\u2019s final opportunity to place slavery on the road to ultimate extinction.\nWashington shared Franklin\u2019s view of slavery as a moral and political anachronism. On three occasions during the 1780s he let it be known that he favored adopting some kind of gradual emancipation scheme and would give his personal support to such a scheme whenever it materialized. Warner Mifflin, one of the Quaker petitioners who knew of Washington\u2019s previous statements, obtained a private interview in order to plead that the President step forward in the manner of Franklin. As the only American with more prestige than Franklin, Washington could make the decisive difference in removing this one massive stain on the Revolutionary legacy, as well as on his own.\nWe can never know what might have happened if Washington had taken this advice. He listened politely to Mifflin\u2019s request but refused to commit himself, on the grounds that the matter was properly the province of Congress and \u201cmight come before me for official decision.\u201d He struck a more cynical tone in letters to friends back in Virginia: \u201d. . . the introduction of the Quaker Memorial, rejecting slavery, was to be sure, not only an ill-judged piece of business, but occasioned a great waste of time.\u201d He endorsed Madison\u2019s deft management of the debate and behind-the-scenes maneuvering in the House, which voted to prohibit any further consideration of ending the slave trade until 1808, as the Constitution specified; more significantly, Madison managed to take slavery off the national agenda by making any legislation seeking to end it a state rather than federal prerogative. Washington expressed his satisfaction that the threatening subject \u201chas at last been put to sleep, and will scarcely awake before the year 1808.\u201d\nWhat strikes us as a poignant failure of moral leadership appeared to Washington as a prudent exercise of political judgment. There is no evidence that he struggled over the decision. Whatever his personal views on slavery may have been, his highest public priority was the creation of a unified American nation. The debates in the House only dramatized the intractable sectional differences he had witnessed from the chair at the Constitutional Convention. They reinforced his conviction that slavery was the one issue with the political potential to destroy the republican experiment in its infancy.\nFinally, in the most dramatic delegation of all, Washington gave total responsibility for rescuing the debt-burdened American economy to his charismatic Secretary of the Treasury. Before Hamilton was appointed, in September of 1789, Washington requested financial records from the old confederation government and quickly discovered that he had inherited a messy mass of state, domestic, and foreign debt. The records were bedeviled by floating bond rates, complicated currency conversion tables, and guesswork revenue projections that, taken together, were an accountant\u2019s worst nightmare. After making a heroic effort of his own that merely confirmed his sense of futility, Washington handed the records and fiscal policy of the new nation to his former aide-de-camp, who turned out to be, among other things, a financial genius.\nHamilton buried himself in the numbers for three months, then emerged with a 40,000-word document titled Report on Public Credit. His calculations revealed that the total debt of the United States had reached the daunting (for then) size of $77.1 million, which he divided into three separate ledgers: foreign debt ($11.7 million), federal debt ($40.4 million), and state debt ($25 million). Several generations of historians and economists have analyzed the intricacies of Hamilton\u2019s Report and created a formidable body of scholarship on its technical complexities, but for our purposes it is sufficient to know that Hamilton\u2019s calculations were accurate and his strategy simple: Consolidate the messy columns of foreign and domestic debt into one central pile. He proposed funding the federal debt at par, assuming all the state debts, then creating a national bank to manage all the investments and payments at the federal level.\nThis made excellent economic sense, as the resultant improved credit rating of the United States in foreign banks and surging productivity in the commercial sector demonstrated. But it also proved to be a political bombshell that shook Congress for more than a year. For Hamilton had managed to create, almost single-handedly, an unambiguously national economic policy that presumed the sovereign power of the federal government. He had pursued a bolder course than the more cautious framers of the Judiciary Act had followed in designing the court system, leaving no doubt that control over fiscal policy would not be brokered to accommodate the states. All three ingredients in his plan\u2014funding, assumption, and the bank\u2014were vigorously contested in Congress, with Madison leading the opposition. The watchword of the critics was consolidation, an ideological cousin to monarchy.\nWashington did not respond. Indeed, he played no public role at all in defending Hamilton\u2019s program during the fierce congressional debates. For his part, Hamilton never requested presidential advice or assistance, regarding control over his own bailiwick as his responsibility. A reader of their correspondence might plausibly conclude that the important topics of business were the staffing of lighthouses and the proper design of Coast Guard cutters to enforce customs collections. But no public statements were necessary, in part because Hamilton was a one-man army in defending his program, \u201ca host unto himself,\u201d as Jefferson later called him, and by February of 1791 the last piece of the Hamiltonian scheme, the bank, had been passed by Congress and now only required the presidential signature.\nBut the bank proved to be the one controversial issue that Washington could not completely delegate to Hamilton. As a symbol it was every bit as threatening, as palpable an embodiment of federal power, as a sovereign Supreme Court. As part of a last-ditch campaign to scuttle the bank, the three Virginians within Washington\u2019s official family mobilized to attack it on constitutional grounds. Jefferson, Madison, and Randolph submitted separate briefs, all arguing that the power to create a corporation was nowhere specified by the Constitution and that the Tenth Amendment clearly stated that powers not granted to the federal government were retained by the states. Before rendering his own verdict, Washington sent the three negative opinions to Hamilton for rebuttal. His response, which exceeded 13,000 words, became a landmark in American legal history, arguing that the \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d clause of the Constitution (Article 1, Section 8) granted implied powers to the federal government beyond the explicit powers specified in the document. Though there is some evidence that Washington was wavering before Hamilton delivered his opinion, it was not the brilliance of the opinion that persuaded him. Rather, it provided the legal rationale he needed to do what he had always wanted to do. For the truth was that Washington was just as much an economic nationalist as Hamilton, a fact that Hamilton\u2019s virtuoso leadership throughout the yearlong debate had conveniently obscured.\nAs both a symbolic political centerpiece and a deft delegator of responsibility, Washington managed to levitate above the political landscape. That was his preferred position, personally because it made his natural aloofness into an asset, politically because it removed the Presidency from the partisan battles on the ground. In three policy areas, however\u2014the location of the national capital, foreign policy, and Indian affairs\u2014he reverted to the kind of meticulous personal management he had pursued at Mount Vernon.\nWhat was called \u201cthe residence question\u201d had its origins in a provision of the Constitution mandating Congress to establish a \u201cseat of government\u201d without specifying the location. By the spring of 1790 the debates in Congress had deteriorated into a comic parody on the gridlock theme. Sixteen different sites had been proposed, then rejected, as state and regional voting blocs mobilized against each alternative in order to preserve their own preferences. One frustrated congressman suggested that perhaps they should put the new capital on wheels and roll it from place to place. An equally frustrated newspaper editor observed that \u201csince the usual custom is for the capital of new empires to be selected by the whim or caprice of a despot,\u201d and since Washington \u201chad never given bad advice to his country,\u201d why not \u201clet him point to a map and say \u2018here\u2019?\u201d\nThat is not quite how the Potomac site emerged victorious. Madison had been leading the fight in the House for a Potomac location, earning the nickname \u201cBig Knife\u201d for cutting deals to block the other alternatives. (One of Madison\u2019s most inspired arguments was that the geographic midpoint of the nation on a north-south axis was not just the mouth of the Potomac, but Mount Vernon itself, a revelation of providential proportions.) Eventually a private bargain was struck over dinner at Jefferson\u2019s apartment, subsequently enshrined in lore as the most consequential dinner party in American history, where Hamilton agreed to deliver sufficient votes from several Northern states to clinch the Potomac location in return for Madison\u2019s pledge to permit passage of Hamilton\u2019s assumption bill. Actually, there were multiple behind-the-scenes bargaining sessions going on at the same time, but the notion that an apparently intractable political controversy could be resolved by a friendly conversation over port and cigars has always possessed an irresistible narrative charm. The story also conjured up the attractive picture of brotherly cooperation within his official family that Washington liked to encourage.\nSoon after the Residence Act designating a Potomac location passed, in July of 1790, that newspaper editor\u2019s suggestion (give the whole messy question to Washington) became fully operative. Jefferson feared that the Potomac site would be sabotaged if the endless management details for developing a city from scratch were left to Congress. So he proposed a thoroughly imperial solution: Bypass Congress altogether by making all subsequent decisions about architects, managers, and construction schedules an Executive responsibility, \u201csubject to the President\u2019s direction in every point.\u201d\nAnd so they were. What became Washington, D.C., was aptly named, for while the project had many troops involved in its design and construction, it had only one supreme commander. He selected the specific site on the Potomac between Rock Creek and Goose Creek, while pretending to prefer a different location to hold down the purchase price for the lots. He appointed the commissioners, who reported directly to him rather than to Congress. He chose Pierre L\u2019Enfant as chief architect, personally endorsing L\u2019Enfant\u2019s plan for a huge tract encompassing nine and a half square miles and thereby rejecting Jefferson\u2019s preference for a small village that would gradually expand in favor of a massive area that would gradually fill up. When L\u2019Enfant\u2019s grandiose vision led to equivalently grandiose demands\u2014he refused to take orders from the commissioners and responded to one stubborn owner of a key lot by blowing up his house\u2014Washington fired him. He approved the sites for the presidential mansion and the Capitol as well as the architects who designed them. All in all, he treated the nascent national capital as a public version of his Mount Vernon plantation, right down to the supervision of the slave labor force that did much of the work.\nIt helped that the construction site was located near Mount Vernon, so he could make regular visits to monitor progress on his trips home from the capital in Philadelphia. It also helped that Jefferson and Madison could confer with him at the site on their trips back to Monticello and Montpelier. At a time when both Virginians were leading the opposition to Hamilton\u2019s financial program, their cooperation on this ongoing project served to bridge the widening chasm within the official family over the Hamiltonian vision of federal power. However therapeutic the cooperation, it belied a fundamental disagreement over the political implications of their mutual interests in the Federal City, as it was then called. For Jefferson and Madison regarded the Potomac location of the permanent capital as a guarantee of Virginia\u2019s abiding hegemony within the Union, as a form of geographic assurance, if you will, that the government would always speak with a Southern accent. Washington thought more expansively, envisioning the capital as a focusing device for national energies that would overcome regional jealousies, performing the same unifying function geographically that he performed symbolically. His personal hobbyhorse became a national university within the capital, where the brightest young men from all regions could congregate and share a common experience as Americans that helped to \u201crub off\u201d their sectional habits and accents.\nHis hands-on approach toward foreign policy was only slightly less direct than his control of the Potomac project, and the basic principles underlying Washington\u2019s view of the national interest were present from the start. Most elementally, he was a thoroughgoing realist. Though he embraced republican ideals, he believed that the behavior of nations was driven not by ideals but by interests. This put him at odds ideologically and temperamentally with his Secretary of State, since Jefferson was one of the most eloquent spokesmen for the belief that American ideals were American interests. Jefferson\u2019s recent experience in Paris as a witness to the onset of the French Revolution had only confirmed his conviction that a global struggle on behalf of those ideals had just begun and that it had a moral claim on American support. Washington was pleased to receive the key to the Bastille from Lafavette; he also knew as well as or better than anyone else that the victory over Great Britain would have been impossible without French economic and military assistance. But he was determined to prevent his warm memories of Rochambeau\u2019s soldiers and de Grasse\u2019s ships at Yorktown from influencing his judgment about the long-term interests of the United States.\nThose interests, he was convinced, did not lie across the Atlantic but across the Alleghenies. The chief task, as Washington saw it, was to consolidate control of the North American continent east of the Mississippi. Although Jefferson had never been west of the Blue Ridge Mountains, he shared Washington\u2019s preference for Western vistas. (During his own Presidency Jefferson would do more than anyone to expand those vistas beyond the Mississippi to the Pacific.)\nTight presidential control over foreign policy was unavoidable at the start because Jefferson did not come on board until March of 1790. Washington immediately delegated all routine business to him but preserved his own private lines of communication on French developments, describing reports of escalating bloodshed he received from Paris \u201cas if they were the events of another planet.\u201d His cautionary posture toward revolutionary France received reinforcement from Gouverneur Morris, a willfully eccentric and thoroughly irreverent American in Paris whom Washington cultivated as a correspondent. Morris described France\u2019s revolutionary leaders as \u201ca Fleet at Anchor in the fog,\u201d and he dismissed as a hopelessly romantic illusion Jefferson\u2019s view that a Gallic version of 1776 was under way. The American Revolution, Morris observed, had been guided by experience and light, while the French were obsessed with experiment and lightning.\nWashington\u2019s supervisory style, as well as his realistic foreign-policy convictions, was put on display when a potential crisis surfaced in the summer of 1790. A minor incident involving Great Britain and Spain in Nootka Sound (near modern-day Vancouver) prompted a major appraisal of American national interests. The British appeared poised to use the incident to launch an invasion from Canada down the Mississippi, to displace Spain as the dominant European power in the American West. This threatened to change the entire strategic chemistry on the continent and raised the daunting prospect of another war with Great Britain.\nWashington convened his Cabinet in Executive session, thereby making clear for the first time that the Cabinet and not the more cumbersome Senate would be his advisory council on foreign policy. He solicited written opinions from all the major players, including Adams, Hamilton, Jay, Jefferson, and Knox. The crisis fizzled away when the British decided to back off, but during the deliberations two revealing facts became clearer, first that Washington was resolved to avoid war at any cost, convinced that the fragile American Republic was neither militarily nor economically capable of confronting the British leviathan at this time, and second that Hamilton\u2019s strategic assessment, not Jefferson\u2019s, was more closely aligned with his own, which turned out to be a preview of coming attractions.\nStrictly speaking, the federal government\u2019s relations with the Native American tribes were also a foreign-policy matter. From the start, however, with Jefferson arriving late on the scene, Indian affairs came under the authority of the Secretary of War. As ominous as this might appear in retrospect, Knox took responsibility for negotiating the disputed terms of several treaties approved by the Confederation Congress. For both personal and policy reasons Washington wanted his own hand firmly on this particular tiller, and his intimate relationship with Knox assured a seamless coordination guided by his own judgment. He had been present at the start of the struggle for control of the American interior, and he regarded the final fate of the Indian inhabitants as an important piece of unfinished business that must not be allowed to end on a tragic note.\nAt the policy level, if America\u2019s future lay to the west, as Washington believed, it followed that the region between the Alleghenies and the Mississippi merited Executive attention more than the diplomatic doings in Europe. Knox estimated that about 76,000 Indians lived in the region, about 20,000 of them warriors, which meant that venerable tribal chiefs like Cornplanter and Joseph Brant deserved more cultivation as valuable allies than did heads of state across the Atlantic. At the personal level, Washington had experienced Indian power firsthand. As commander of the Virginia Regiment during the French and Indian War, he saw Native Americans not as exotic savages but as familiar and formidable adversaries fighting for their own independence, behaving pretty much as he would do in their place. Moreover, the letters the new President received from several tribal chiefs provided poignant testimony that they now regarded him as their personal protector. \u201cBrother,\u201d wrote one Cherokee chief, \u201cwe give up to our white brothers all the land we could any how spare, and have but little left. . . and we hope you wont let any people take any more from us without our consent. We are neither Birds nor Fish; we can neither fly in the air nor live under water. . . .We are made by the same hand and in the same shape as yourselves.\u201d\nSuch pleas did not fall on deaf ears. Working closely with Knox, Washington devised a policy designed to create several sovereign Indian \u201chomelands.\u201d He concurred when Knox insisted that \u201cthe independent tribes of indians ought to be considered as foreign nations, not as the subjects of any particular State.\u201d Treaties with these tribes ought to be regarded as binding contracts with the federal government, whose jurisdiction could not be compromised: \u201cIndians being the prior occupants possess the right of the Soil. . . . To dispossess them . . . would be a gross violation of the fundamental Laws of Nature and of that distributive Justice which is the glory of a nation.\u201d A more coercive policy of outright confiscation, Washington believed, would constitute a moral failure that \u201cwould stain the character of the nation.\u201d He sought to avoid the outcome\u2014Indian removal\u2014that occurred more than 40 years later under Andrew Jackson. Instead, he envisioned multiple sanctuaries under tribal control that would be bypassed by the surging wave of white settlers and whose occupants would gradually, over the course of the next century, become assimilated as full-fledged American citizens.\nAttempting to make this vision a reality occupied more of Washington\u2019s time and energy than any other foreign or domestic issue during his first term. Success depended on finding leaders willing to negotiate yet powerful enough to impose a settlement on other tribes. Knox and Washington found a charismatic Creek chief of mixed blood named Alexander McGillivray, a literate man whose diplomatic skills and survival instincts made him the Indian version of France\u2019s Talleyrand, and in the summer of 1790 Washington hosted McGillivray and 26 chiefs for several weeks of official dinners, parades, and diplomatic ceremonies more lavish than any European delegation enjoyed. (McGillivray expected and received a personal bribe of $1,200 a year to offset the bribe the Spanish were already paying him not to negotiate with the Americans.) Washington and the chiefs locked arms in Indian style and invoked the Great Spirit, and then the chiefs made their marks on the Treaty of New York, redrawing the borders for a sovereign Creek Nation. Washington reinforced the terms of the treaty by issuing the Proclamation of 1790, an Executive Order forbidding private or state encroachments on all Indian lands guaranteed by treaty with the United States.\nBut the President soon found that it was one thing to proclaim and quite another to sustain. The Georgia legislature defied the proclamation by making a thoroughly corrupt bargain to sell more than 15 million acres on its western border to speculators calling themselves the Yazoo Companies, thereby rendering the Treaty of New York a worthless piece of paper. In the northern district above the Ohio, no equivalent to McGillivray could be found, mostly because the Six Nations, which Washington could remember as a potent force in the region, had been virtually destroyed in the War for Independence and could no longer exercise hegemony over the Ohio Valley tribes.\nWashington was forced to approve a series of military expeditions into the Ohio Valley to put down uprisings by the Miamis, Wyandots, and Shawnees, even though he believed that the chief culprits were white vigilante groups determined to provoke hostilities. The Indian side of the story, he complained, would never make it into the history books: \u201cThey, poor wretches, have no press thro\u2019 which their grievances are related; and it is well known, that when one side only of a Story is heard, and often repeated, the human mind becomes impressed with it, insensibly.\u201d Worse still, the expedition commanded by Arthur St. Clair was virtually annihilated in the fall of 1791\u2014reading St. Clair\u2019s battle orders is like watching Custer prepare for the Little Bighorn\u2014thereby creating white martyrs and provoking congressional cries for reprisals in what had become an escalating cycle of violence that defied Washington\u2019s efforts at conciliation.\nEventually the President was forced to acknowledge that his vision of secure Indian sanctuaries could not be enforced. \u201cI believe scarcely any thing short of a Chinese wall,\u201d he lamented, \u201cwill restrain Land jobbers and the encroachment of settlers upon the Indian country.\u201d Knox concurred, estimating that federal control on the frontier would require an arc of forts from Lake Erie to the Gulf of Mexico, garrisoned by no less than 50,000 troops. This was a logistical, economic, and political impossibility. Washington\u2019s vision of peaceful coexistence also required that federal jurisdiction over the states as the ultimate guarantor of all treaties be recognized as supreme, which helps explain why he was so passionate about the issue, but also why it could never happen. If a just accommodation with the Native American populations was the major preoccupation of his first term, it was also the singular failure.\nBy the spring of 1792, then, what Washington had imagined as a brief caretaker Presidency with mostly ceremonial functions had grown into a judicious but potent projection of Executive power. The Presidency so vaguely defined in the Constitution had congealed into a unique synthesis of symbolism and substance, its occupant the embodiment of that work in progress called the United States and the chief magistrate with supervisory responsibility for all domestic and foreign policy, in effect an elected king and prime minister rolled into one. There was a sense at the time, since confirmed by most historians of the Presidency, that no one else could have managed this political evolution so successfully, indeed that under anyone else the experiment with republican government would probably have failed at the start. Eventually the operation of the federal government under the Constitution would be described as \u201ca machine that ran itself.\u201d At the outset, however, the now venerable checks and balances of the Constitution required a trusted leader who had internalized checks and balances sufficiently to understand both the need for Executive power and the limitations of its effectiveness. He made the Presidency a projection of himself.\nWashington tried to step down after those first four years and, perhaps predictably, failed. His second term was increasingly full of rancor, with dramatic developments in Europe and mounting tensions between Jefferson and Hamilton within his Cabinet that together threatened to destroy all he had accomplished.

{"text":"In response to growing demand from western U.S. and Canadian outdoor fruit and berry producers, Biobest is developing a native western bumblebee for outdoor pollination.\nBumblebees are important pollinators of many cultivated crops. By pollinating our fruits and vegetables, they not only help deliver our healthy meals, but are also vital to overall food security. Bumblebees have the edge when it comes to effective pollination. They produce their own heat, which in combination with their furry coats enables them to fly early in the season when it is still far too cold for honeybees and other insects. Unlike honeybees, they also buzz or shake flowers to collect pollen, which assures effective pollination.\nThe use of bumblebees has allowed growers to produce higher-yielding, better-quality and safer crops. In food crops like greenhouse tomatoes, bumblebees have for many years successfully replaced physical pollination or chemicals previously used to induce fruit set.\nThe demand for bumblebees to help guarantee crop yield has increased in recent years as honeybees and other natural pollinators have declined, but because native western species have not been available commercially, western U.S. and Canadian growers of field crops like berries, top fruit and canola have been at a disadvantage,\nunable to share in the many benefits these pollinators offer.\nBiobest recognizes the ecological and economic benefits of using native species for pollination. Having pioneered the use of bumblebees for crop pollination, Biobest has now developed a native western bumblebee species especially for the western U.S. and Canada. Biobest has been successful in rearing a range of native western bumblebee species, allowing them to select the right candidate for the western U.S. market.\nThe company says that only the species that proves most successful in crop pollination will be launched for use in its native territory.

{"text":"The Oregon Trail opened the way west for intrepid settlers and enterprising miners. Once it was well established and the roads were cleared and expanded, once towns had grown up along the route and locations in the Rockies and further west were settled, it was only natural that a new method of transportation would take over: stagecoaches.\nThe technology behind stagecoaches wasn\u2019t new. Carriages were the primary form of mass transportation in the pre-locomotive age. What made stagecoaches different from regular carriages were their size and the way they were supported on the wheel frame. Rather than relying on springs, which jostled a rider up and down, stagecoaches made use of thoroughbraces, leather straps that supported the body of the stagecoach and gave it more of a rocking motion.Stagecoaches could generally fit nine passengers inside and six outside. Inside, as you can probably guess, meant that passengers traveled inside the body of the coach. They would ride on three benches, two facing forward and the foremost one facing backwards, three riders to a bench. As you can imagine, it was a tight squeeze. Passengers in the first two benches would often have to wedge their knees between one another to make room. They would carry their baggage and often have mail under their feet. But if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, the six passengers riding outside of the carriage would be just as cramped and exposed to the elements.\nBut what passengers lost in comfort, they made up for in speed. The most common type of stagecoach was the Concord stagecoach, manufactured in Concord, New Hampshire. These stagecoaches rarely broke down. They were drawn by a team of six horses and could cut through the new roadways of the west much faster than any wagon train ever could.\nThis is part of the reason that almost all stagecoaches carried mail as well as passengers. More than just mail, in fact. It was common for stagecoaches to carry gold and cash being transported on behalf of one bank or another. This, of course, meant that there was a real danger of robberies along the road.\nThe first major stagecoach robbery in California took place in 1852 when Reelfoot Williams and his gang robbed a Nevada City coach. The gang had set up a network of informants to monitor when stages were coming and what money and passengers they were carrying. They carried off the heist, setting a precedent that many would follow. For that reason, and because of the very real threat of attacks by Native Americans, passengers were advised to carry guns and knives with them and drivers were well armed.\nSo, you might ask yourself. Who was in charge of all these stagecoaches? You probably already know the answer without knowing it. There were several stagecoach companies in the east that had been in operation even before the 19th century. But one of the biggest and most successful companies developed in the 1830s as a service to deliver packages between Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. Adams & Company gradually moved west as steamships replaced overland routes for fast transportation between the major eastern cities.\nAdams & Company did well in California after the gold rush, until mismanagement and the emergence of a serious competitor changed everything. That competitor was a little company started by two men, Henry Wells and William G. Fargo. The company that Wells and Fargo started offered more than just stagecoach service. It offered banking and mail services as well. In fact, by the time the 1850s rolled around, Wells Fargo was widely known to be faster and more reliable about delivering the mail than the U.S. Postal service.\nThen came the Panic of 1855. The California banking system, puffed up on speculation of continued profits from the Gold Rush, collapsed. Many businesses, including Adams & Company, folded. But Wells Fargo managed to hold on. Not only did it hold on, it emerged as one of the only viable options in stagecoach transportation.\nSince Wells Fargo pretty much had a monopoly on stagecoach transportation in the west after 1855, they could make the rules. And some of those rules were:\nAbstinence from liquor is requested, but if you must drink share the bottle. To do otherwise makes you appear selfish and unneighborly.\nIf ladies are present, gentlemen are urged to forego smoking cigars and pipes as the odor of same is repugnant to the gentler sex. Chewing tobacco is permitted, but spit with the wind, not against it.\nGentlemen must refrain from the use of rough language in the presence of ladies and children.\nBuffalo robes are provided for your comfort in cold weather. Hogging robes will not be tolerated and the offender will be made to ride with the driver.\nDon\u2019t snore loudly while sleeping or use your fellow passenger\u2019s shoulder for a pillow; he or she may not understand and friction may result.\nFirearms may be kept on your person for use in emergencies. Do not fire them for pleasure or shoot at wild animals as the sound riles the horses.\nIn the event of runaway horses remain calm. Leaping from the coach in panic will leave you injured, at the mercy of the elements, hostile Indians and hungry coyotes.\nForbidden topics of conversation are: stagecoach robberies and Indian uprisings.\nGents guilty of unchivalrous behavior toward lady passengers will be put off the stage. It\u2019s a long walk back. A word to the wise is sufficient.*\nSo there you have it. Stagecoach transportation in the Old West. Traveling by stagecoach was the only way to go in those days \u2026 until the railroad came along and changed everything\u2026.","id":"<urn:uuid:44892bde-dc4e-4668-88dc-48f754c76b11>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/merryfarmer.net\/2012\/08\/08\/western-wednesday-stagecoaches\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9819564223,"token_count":1181,"score":3.84375,"int_score":4}

{"text":"\"GOT NOTHING BUT BLUE SKIES\"\nIt is September 19,1783. The place, Lyons, France. Preparations are being made for a journey. A journey that will eventually take man from his secure environment of terra firma, and place him in a hostile environment called the atmosphere. The vehicle to be used is a hot air balloon. The brainchild behind this trek is a wealthy paper maker named Joseph Montgolfier. There has been much speculation over just how Montgolfier made the discovery of the hot air balloon. The most commonly-believed story is that his wife was standing too close to a fire and that the smoke caused her skirt to be inflated and lifted above her knees. This caused Montgolfier to wonder-if this smoke, and its magical lifting powers, could be captured in a very large container, it might rise and lift a passenger along with it.\nSo, Montgolfier went about building the first hot air balloon. In 1783,\nnot much was known about the atmosphere and its effects on human beings.\nUpon examination of the occupants for any ill effects caused by this lofty height, it was discovered that the duck had a broken wing. Could this have been an effect of exposure to altitude? Actually, several observers noted that as the balloon left the ground, the sheep had an anxiety attack and kicked the duck. Montgolfier reasoned that it would be safe for humans to ascend to altitude. So on November 21, 1783, Jean Francois Pilatre de Rozier (a surgeon) became the first aeronaut and flight surgeon. Over 200 years have passed since that first flight. Technology has allowed us to ascend through the atmosphere and into space, but the hazards of high altitude flight (hypoxia, altitude-induced decompression sickness, and trapped gases) will always be present. That is because humans are best suited to live in what is known as the \"physiological efficient zone\". This zone extends from sea level to 12,000 feet. When humans are exposed to altitudes above this zone, they are subjected to physiological hazards beyond their natural ability to adapt.\nOne thing to keep in mind is that everything that occupies space and exerts weight is considered to be matter. All matter is made up of atoms and molecules in varying densities. These particles within the matter are kinetic and in constant motion. The slower the motion of the particles, the more dense the matter becomes. Also, as the particles are pushed closer together, the matter also becomes more dense. The best way to slow down kinetic molecules is to cool the matter. The best way to get them to move closer together is to add pressure to the matter. Inversely, when you remove the pressure or heat any material, the molecules within the material moves faster and further apart, thus making the material less dense.\nThe least dense form of matter is, of course, gas. If a gas is cooled and compressed, at some point it will become a liquid. If that liquid is then cooled further, then at some point it will become a solid. Also, when you take the pressure off any gas or liquid, that material will grow less dense and expand. This is essentially what happens to the gaseous molecules of our atmosphere.\nOur atmosphere contains approximately 79% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, a constant ratio until you reach an altitude of about 270,000 feet. So the question that always comes up is; \"If I have 21% oxygen at sea level and 21% at 40,000 feet, why do I succumb to the effects of hypoxia within 20 seconds at that altitude?\"\nThe answer is, ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE! If you could picture all the gaseous nitrogen and oxygen molecules in the atmosphere, they would stack up from the surface of the earth to the fringe of space. All these molecules stacking on top each other create a great deal of weight, or pressure. At sea level, one square-inch of any surface has about 15 pounds of air sitting on top of it. At 18,000 feet, that same square inch has only 7.5 pounds per square-inch (psi) exerted on it. What has caused this atmospheric pressure drop? The answer is simple: There is more air stacked up at sea level than above 18,000 feet, and therefore, more weight.\nAs you recall, when molecules are subjected to this pressure, they are going to move closer together. This will make the air more dense with oxygen and nitrogen molecules. For example, if at sea level you take in a breath of air that has an atmospheric pressure of 15 psi, then that air may contain 500 billion molecules of oxygen (this a fictitious number to be used only as an example); if you go to 18,000 feet and take the same breath where atmospheric pressure is 7.5 psi, then you will pull in only 250 billion molecules of oxygen. But, you require 500 billion per breath to function normally, and you're getting only half of what you need. That's HYPOXIA!\nNot only do gaseous molecules in the atmosphere expand with reduced total pressure, gases in the human body are also subject to the same expansion. There are several areas in the body- ears, sinuses, lungs, gastro-intestinal tract, and teeth - where these gases can expand and cause a variety of problems. As long as the gas can expand and escape, there will be no problem. But if the gas becomes trapped, then pain will be the usual result.\nAs we have discussed earlier, the air we breathe contains about 79% nitrogen. Nitrogen is inhaled into the lungs and distributed and stored throughout the body. According to gas laws, gases of higher pressure always exert force towards areas of low pressure. When you inhale nitrogen, it will be stored at a pressure of about 12 psi (79% nitrogen) of 15 psi (total atmospheric pressure), equal to about 12 psi).\nWhen you ascend to altitude and the pressure around your body begins to drop, this creates a pressure gradient (higher nitrogen in the body than outside the body) and the nitrogen will try to equalize and escape outside the body. Sometimes this nitrogen can leave so quickly and in such quantify that it may form a bubble. If this bubble forms at a body joint, the pain it causes is know as \"the bends.\"\nThese are just a few of the problems that can occur when the human body is exposed to high altitude conditions. These problems will always be there for aviation. But through education and knowledge of the mechanisms that cause these problems, we can take steps toward protection and prevention so that your BLUE SKIES won't give you a case of the blues.\nby J.R.

Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman had made for her a little red riding-hood; which became the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding-Hood.\nOne day her mother, having made some custards, said to her:\n\"Go, my dear, and see how thy grandmamma does, for I hear she has been very ill; carry her a custard, and this little pot of butter.\"\nLittle Red Riding-Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village.\nAs she was going through the wood, she met with Gaffer Wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some faggot-makers hard by in the forest. He asked her whither she was going. The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and hear a wolf talk, said to him:\n\"I am going to see my grandmamma and carry her a custard and a little pot of butter from my mamma.\"\n\"Does she live far off?\" said the Wolf.\n\"Oh! aye,\" answered Little Red Riding-Hood; \"it is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house in the village.\"\n\"Well,\" said the Wolf, \"and I'll go and see her too. I'll go this way and you go that, and we shall see who will be there soonest.\"\nThe Wolf began to run as fast as he could, taking the nearest way, and the little girl went by that farthest about, diverting herself in gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and making nosegays of such little flowers as she met with. The Wolf was not long before he got to the old woman's house. He knocked at the door\u2014tap, tap.\n\"Your grandchild, Little Red Riding-Hood,\" replied the Wolf, counterfeiting her voice; \"who has brought you a custard and a little pot of butter sent you by mamma.\"\nThe good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out:\n\"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"The Wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then presently he fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it was above three days that he had not touched a bit. He then shut the door and went into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding-Hood, who came some time afterward and knocked at the door\u2014tap, tap.\nLittle Red Riding-Hood, hearing the big voice of the Wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had got a cold and was hoarse, answered:\n\"\u2019Tis your grandchild, Little Red Riding-Hood, who has brought you a custard and a little pot of butter mamma sends you.\"\nThe Wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could:\n\"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\nLittle Red Riding-Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.\nThe Wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bed-clothes:\n\"Put the custard and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come and lie down with me.\"\nLittle Red Riding-Hood undressed herself and went into bed, where, being greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her night-clothes, she said to her:\n\"Grandmamma, what great arms you have got!\"\n\"That is the better to hug thee, my dear.\"\n\"Grandmamma, what great legs you have got!\"\n\"That is to run the better, my child.\"\n\"Grandmamma, what great ears you have got!\"\n\"That is to hear the better, my child.\"\n\"Grandmamma, what great eyes you have got!\"\n\"It is to see the better, my child.\"\n\"Grandmamma, what great teeth you have got!\"\n\"That is to eat thee up.\"\nAnd, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding-Hood, and tried to start eating her. Red Riding Hood screamed \u201cSomeone Help Me!\u201d over and over again.\nThe woodcutter, who was felling trees nearby, heard Red Riding Hood\u2019s screams for help and ran to the cottage. He burst in to find the wolf trying to eat Red Riding Hood.\nHe swung his axe, and with one blow killed the bad wolf for which Red Riding Hood was ever so grateful.\nGreat Book!

{"text":"[Note: in Japan, it is customary to refer to a person with their last name first. We have retained this practice in the below excerpt from Kurosawa\u2019s text.]\nThe gate was growing larger and larger in my mind\u2019s eye. I was location-scouting in the ancient capital of Kyoto for Rashomon, my eleventh-century period film. The Daiei management was not very happy with the project. They said the content was difficult and the title had no appeal. They were reluctant to let the shooting begin. Day by day, as I waited, I walked around Kyoto and the still-more-ancient capital of Nara a few miles away, studying the classical architecture. The more I saw, the larger the image of the Rashomon gate became in my mind.\nAt first I thought my gate should be about the size of the entrance gate to Toji Temple in Kyoto. Then it became as large as the Tengaimon gate in Nara, and finally as big as the main two-story gates of the Ninnaji and Todaiji temples in Nara. This image enlargement occurred not just because I had the opportunity to see real gates dating from that period, but because of what I was learning, from documents and relics, about the long-since-destroyed Rashomon gate itself.\n\u201cRashomon\u201d actually refers to the Rajomon gate; the name was changed in a Noh play written by Kanze Nobumitsu. \u201cRajo\u201d indicates the outer precincts of the castle, so \u201cRajomon\u201d means the main gate to the castle\u2019s outer grounds. The gate for my film Rashomon was the main gate to the outer precincts of the ancient capital--\u2013--\u2013Kyoto was at that time called \u201cHeian-Kyo.\u201d If one entered the capital through the Rajomon gate and continued due north along the main thoroughfare of the metropolis, one came to the Shujakumon gate at the end of it, and the Toji and Saiji temples to the east and west, respectively. Considering this city plan, it would have been strange had the outer main gate not been the biggest gate of all. There is tangible evidence that it in fact was: The blue roof tiles that survive from the original Rajomon gate show that it was large. But, no matter how much research we did, we couldn\u2019t discover the actual dimensions of the vanished structure.\nAs a result, we had to construct the Rashomon gate to the city based on what we could learn from looking at extant temple gates, knowing that the original was probably different. What we built as a set was gigantic. It was so immense that a complete roof would have buckled the support pillars. Using the artistic device of dilapidation as an excuse, we constructed only half a roof and were able to get away with our measurements. To be historically accurate, the imperial palace and the Shujakumon gate should have been visible looking north through our gate. But on the Daiei back lot such distances were out of the question, and even if we had been able to find the space, the budget would have made it impossible. We made do with a cut-out mountain to be seen through the gate. Even so, what we built was extraordinarily large for an open set.\nWhen I took this project to Daiei, I told them the only sets I would need were the gate and the tribunal courtyard wall where all the survivors, participants and witnesses of the rape and murder that form the story of the film are questioned. Everything else, I promised them, would be shot on location. Based on this low-budget set estimate, Daiei happily took on the project.\nLater, Kawaguchi Matsutaro, at that time a Daiei executive, complained that they had really been fed a line. To be sure, only the gate set had to be built, but for the price of that one mammoth set they could have had over a hundred ordinary sets. But, to tell the truth, I hadn\u2019t intended so big a set to begin with. It was while I was kept waiting all that time that my research deepened and my image of the gate swelled to its startling proportions.\nWhen I had finished Scandal for the Shochiku studios, Daiei asked if I wouldn\u2019t direct one more film for them. As I cast about for what to film, I suddenly remembered a script based on the short story \u201cYabu no naka\u201d (\u201cIn a Grove\u201d) by Akutagawa Ryunosuke. It had been written by Hashimoto Shinobu, who had been studying under director Itami Mansaku. It was a very well-written piece, but not long enough to make into a feature film. This Hashimoto had visited my home, and I talked with him for hours. He seemed to have substance, and I took a liking to him. He later wrote the screenplays for Ikiru (1952) and Shichinin no samurai (Seven Samurai, 1954) with me. The script I remembered was his Akutagawa adaptation called \u201cMale-Female.\u201d\nProbably my subconscious told me it was not right to have put that script aside; probably I was\u2014without being aware of it\u2013wondering all the while if I couldn\u2019t do something with it. At that moment the memory of it jumped out of one of those creases in my brain and told me to give it a chance. At the same time I recalled that \u201cIn a Grove\u201d is made up of three stories, and realized that if I added one more, the whole would be just the right length for a feature film. Then I remembered the Akutagawa story \u201cRashomon.\u201d Like \u201cIn a Grove,\u201d it was set in the Heian period (794-1184). The film Rashomon took shape in my mind.\nSince the advent of the talkies in the 1930s, I felt, we had misplaced and forgotten what was so wonderful about the old silent movies. I was aware of the aesthetic loss as a constant irritation. I sensed a need to go back to the origins of the motion picture to find this peculiar beauty again; I had to go back into the past.\nIn particular, I believed that there was something to be learned from the spirit of the French avant-garde films of the 1920s. Yet in Japan at this time we had no film library. I had to forage for old films, and try to remember the structure of those I had seen as a boy, ruminating over the aesthetics that had made them special.\nRashomon would be my testing ground, the place where I could apply the ideas and wishes growing out of my silent-film research. To provide the symbolic background atmosphere, I decided to use the Akutagawa \u201cIn a Grove\u201d story, which goes into the depths of the human heart as if with a surgeon\u2019s scalpel, laying bare its dark complexities and bizarre twists. These strange impulses of the human heart would be expressed through the use of an elaborately fashioned play of light and shadow. In the film, people going astray in the thicket of their hearts would wander into a wider wilderness, so I moved the setting to a large forest. I selected the virgin forest of the mountains surrounding Nara, and the forest belonging to the Komyoji temple outside Kyoto.\nThere were only eight characters, but the story was both complex and deep. The script was done as straightforwardly and briefly as possible, so I felt I should be able to create a rich and expansive visual image in turning it into a film. Fortunately, I had as cinematographer a man I had long wanted to work with, Miyagawa Kazuo; I had Hayasaka to compose the music and Matsuyama as art director. The cast was Mifune Toshiro, Mori Masayuki, Kyo Machiko, Shimura Takashi, Chiaki Minoru, Ueda Kichijiro, Kato Daisuke and Honma Fumiko; all were actors whose temperaments I knew, and I could not have wished for a better line-up. Moreover, the story was supposed to take place in summer, and we had, ready to hand, the scintillating midsummer heat of Kyoto and Nara. With all these conditions so neatly met, I could ask nothing more. All that was left was to begin the film.\nHowever, one day just before the shooting was to start, the three assistant directors Daiei had assigned me came to see me at the inn where I was staying. I wondered what the problem could be. It turned out that they found the script baffling and wanted me to explain it to them. \u201cPlease read it again more carefully,\u201d I told them. \u201cIf you read it diligently, you should be able to understand it because it was written with the intention of being comprehensible.\u201d But they wouldn\u2019t leave. \u201cWe believe we have read it carefully, and we still don\u2019t understand it at all; that\u2019s why we want you to explain it to us.\u201d For their persistence I gave them this simple explanation:\nHuman beings are unable to be honest with themselves about themselves. They cannot talk about themselves without embellishing. This script portrays such human beings\u2013the kind who cannot survive without lies to make them feel they are better people than they really are. It even shows this sinful need for flattering falsehood going beyond the grave\u2014even the character who dies cannot give up his lies when he speaks to the living through a medium. Egoism is a sin the human being carries with him from birth; it is the most difficult to redeem. This film is like a strange picture scroll that is unrolled and displayed by the ego. You say that you can\u2019t understand this script at all, but that is because the human heart itself is impossible to understand. If you focus on the impossibility of truly understanding human psychology and read the script one more time, I think you will grasp the point of it.\nAfter I finished, two of the three assistant directors nodded and said they would try reading the script again. They got up to leave, but the third, who was the chief, remained unconvinced. He left with an angry look on his face. (As it turned out, this chief assistant director and I never did get along. I still regret that in the end I had to ask for his resignation. But, aside from this, the work went well.)\nDuring the rehearsals before the shooting I was left virtually speechless by Kyo Machiko\u2019s dedication. She came in to where I was still sleeping in the morning and sat down with the script in her hand. \u201cPlease teach me what to do,\u201d she requested, and I lay there amazed. The other actors, too, were all in their prime. Their spirit and enthusiasm was obvious in their work, and equally manifest in their eating and drinking habits.\nThey invented a dish called Sanzoku-yaki, or \u201cMountain Bandit Broil,\u201d and ate it frequently. It consisted of beef strips saut\u00e9ed in oil and then dipped in a sauce made of curry powder in melted butter. But while they held their chopsticks in one hand, in the other they\u2019d hold a raw onion. From time to time they\u2019d put a strip of meat on the onion and take a bite out of it. Thoroughly barbaric.\nThe shooting began at the Nara virgin forest. This forest was infested with mountain leeches. They dropped out of the trees onto us, they crawled up our legs from the ground to suck our blood. Even when they had had their fill, it was no easy task to pull them off, and once you managed to rip a glutted leech out of your flesh, the open sore seemed never to stop bleeding. Our solution was to put a tub of salt in the entry of the inn. Before we left for the location in the morning we would cover our necks, arms and socks with salt. Leeches are like slugs\u2014they avoid salt.\nIn those days the virgin forest around Nara harbored great numbers of massive cryptomerias and Japanese cypresses, and vines of lush ivy twined from tree to tree like pythons. It had the air of the deepest mountains and hidden glens. Every day I walked in this forest, partly to scout for shooting locations and partly for pleasure. Once a black shadow suddenly darted in front of me: a deer from the Nara park that had returned to the wild. Looking up, I saw a pack of monkeys in the big trees about my head.\nThe inn we were housed in lay at the foot of Mount Wakakusa. Once a big monkey who seemed to be the leader of the pack came and sat on the roof of the inn to stare at us studiously throughout our boisterous evening meal. Another time the moon rose from behind Mount Wakakusa, and for an instant we saw the silhouette of a deer framed distinctly against its full brightness. Often after supper we climbed up Mount Wakakusa and formed a circle to dance in the moonlight. I was still young and the cast members were even younger and bursting with energy. We carried out our work with enthusiasm.\nWhen the location moved from the Nara Mountains to the Komyoji temple forest in Kyoto, it was Gion Festival time. The sultry summer sun hit with full force, but even though some members of my crew succumbed to heat stroke, our work pace never flagged. Every afternoon we pushed through without even stopping for a single swallow of water. When work was over, on the way back to the inn we stopped at a beer hall in Kyoto\u2019s downtown Shijo-Kawaramachi district. There each of us downed about four of the biggest mugs of draft beer they had. But we ate dinner without any alcohol and, upon finishing, split up to go about our private affairs. Then at ten o\u2019clock we\u2019d gather again and pour whiskey down our throats with a vengeance. Every morning we were up bright and clear-headed to do our sweat-drenched work.\nWhere the Komyoji temple forest was too thick to give us the light we needed for shooting, we cut down trees without a moment\u2019s hesitation or explanation. The abbot of Komyoji glared fearfully as he watched us. But as the days went on, he began to take the initiative, showing us where he thought trees should be felled.\nWhen our shoot was finished at the Komyoji location, I went to pay my respects to the abbot. He looked at me with grave seriousness and spoke with deep feeling. \u201cTo be honest with you, at the outset we were very disturbed when you went about cutting down the temple trees as if they belonged to you. But in the end we were won over by your wholehearted enthusiasm. \u2018Show the audience something good.\u2019 This was the focus of all your energies, and you forgot yourselves. Until I had the chance to watch you, I had no idea that the making of a movie was a crystallization of such effort. I was very deeply impressed.\u201d\nThe abbot finished and set a folding fan before me. In commemoration of our filming, he had written on the fan three characters forming a Chinese poem: \u201cBenefit All Mankind.\u201d I was left speechless.\nWe set up a parallel schedule for the use of the Komyoji location and open set of the Rashomon gate. On sunny days we filmed at Komyoji; on cloudy days we filmed the rain scenes at the gate set. Because the gate set was so huge, the job of creating rainfall on it was a major operation. We borrowed fire engines and turned on the studio\u2019s fire hoses to full capacity. But when the camera was aimed upward at the cloudy sky over the gate, the sprinkle of the rain couldn\u2019t be seen against it, so we made rainfall with black ink in it. Every day we worked in temperatures of more than 85\u00ba Fahrenheit, but when the wind blew through the wide-open gate with the terrific rainfall pouring down over it, it was enough to chill the skin.\nI had to be sure that this huge gate looked huge to the camera. And I had to figure out how to use the sun itself. This was a major concern because of the decision to use the light and shadows of the forest as the keynote of the whole film. I determined to solve the problem by actually filming the sun. These days it is not uncommon to point the camera directly at the sun, but at the time Rashomon was being made it was still one of the taboos of cinematography. It was even thought that the sun\u2019s rays shining directly into your lens would burn the film in your camera. But my cameraman, Miyagawa Kazuo, boldly defied this convention and created superb images. The introductory section in particular, which leads the viewer through the light and shadow of the forest into a world where the human heart loses its way, was truly magnificent camera work. I feel that this scene, later praised at the Venice International Film Festival as the first instance of a camera entering the heart of a forest, was not only one of Miyagawa\u2019s masterpieces but a world-class masterpiece of black-and-white cinematography.\nAnd yet, I don\u2019t know what happened to me. Delighted as I was with Miyagawa\u2019s work, it seems I forgot to tell him. When I said to myself, \u201cWonderful,\u201d I guess I thought I had said \u201cWonderful\u201d to him at the same time. I didn\u2019t realize I hadn\u2019t until one day Miyagawa\u2019s old friend Shimura Takashi (who was playing the woodcutter in Rashomon) came to me and said, \u201cMiyagawa\u2019s very concerned about whether his camera work is satisfactory to you.\u201d Recognizing my oversight for the first time, I hurriedly shouted \u201cOne hundred percent! One hundred for camera work! One hundred plus!\u201d\nThere is no end to my recollections of Rashomon. If I tried to write about all of them, I\u2019d never finish, so I\u2019d like to end with one incident that left an indelible impression on me. It has to do with the music.\nAs I was writing the script, I heard the rhythms of a bolero in my head over the episode of the woman\u2019s side of the story. I asked Hayasaka to write a bolero kind of music for the scene. When we came to the dubbing of that scene, Hayasaka sat down next to me and said, \u201cI\u2019ll try it with the music.\u201d In his face I saw uneasiness and anticipation. My own nervousness and expectancy gave me a painful sensation in my chest. The screen lit up with the beginning of the scene, and the strains of the bolero music softly counted out the rhythm. As the scene progressed, the music rose, but the image and the sound failed to coincide and seemed to be at odds with each other. \u201cDamn it,\u201d I thought. The multiplication of sound and image that I had calculated in my head had failed, it seemed. It was enough to make me break out in a cold sweat.\nWe kept going. The bolero music rose yet again, and suddenly picture and sound fell into perfect unison. The mood created was positively eerie. I felt an icy chill run down my spine, and unwittingly I turned to Hayasaka. He was looking at me. His face was pale, and I saw that he was shuddering with the same eerie emotion I felt. From that point on, sound and image proceeded with incredible speed to surpass even the calculations I had made in my head. The effect was strange and overwhelming.\nAnd that is how Rashomon was made. During the shooting there were two fires at the Daiei studios. But because we had mobilized the fire engines for our filming, they were already primed and drilled, so the studios escaped with very minor damage.\nAfter Rashomon I made a film of Dostoevsky\u2019s The Idiot (Hakuchi, 1951) for the Shochiku studios. This Idiot was ruinous. I clashed directly with the studio heads, and then when the reviews on the completed film came out, it was as if they were a mirror reflection of the studio\u2019s attitude toward me. Without exception, they were scathing. On the heels of this disaster, Daiei rescinded its offer for me to do another film with them.\nI listened to this cold announcement at the Chofu studios of Daiei in the Tokyo suburbs. I walked out through the gate in the gloomy daze, and, not having the will even to get on the train, I ruminated over my bleak situation as I walked all the way home to Komae. I concluded that for some time I would have to \u201ceat cold rice\u201d and resigned myself to this fact. Deciding that it would serve no purpose to get excited about it, I set out to go fishing at the Tamagawa River. I cast my line into the river. It immediately caught on something and snapped in two. Having no replacement with me, I hurriedly put my equipment away. Thinking this was what it was like when bad luck catches up with you, I headed back home.\nI arrived home depressed, with barely enough strength to slide open the door to the entry. Suddenly my wife came bounding out. \u201cCongratulations!\u201d I was unwittingly indignant: \u201cFor what?\u201d \u201cRashomon has the Grand Prix.\u201d Rashomon had won the Grand Prix at the Venice International Film Festival, and I was spared from having to eat cold rice.\nOnce again an angel had appeared out of nowhere. I did not even know that Rashomon had been submitted to the Venice Film Festival. The Japan representative to Italiafilm, Giuliana Stramigioli, had seen it and recommended it to Venice. It was like pouring water into the sleeping ears of the Japanese film industry.\nLater Rashomon won the American Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Japanese critics insisted that these two prizes were simply reflections of Westerners\u2019 curiosity and taste for Oriental exoticism, which struck me then, and now, as terrible. Why is it that Japanese people have no confidence in the worth of Japan? Why do they elevate everything foreign and denigrate everything Japanese? Even the woodblock prints of Utamoro, Hokusai and Sharaku were not appreciated by Japanese until they were first discovered by the West. I don\u2019t know how to explain this lack of discernment. I can only despair of the character of my own people.\nExcerpted from Something Like an Autobiography, trans., Audie E. Bock. Translation Copyright \u00a91982 by Vintage Books.

Risk messages are difficult to formulate in ways that are accurate, clear, and not rn~sTeading. One reads, for example, that \"radon risk can equal or exceed the 2%o risk of death in an auto accident, . . . for anyone who lives 20 years at levels exceeding about 25 picocuries per liter\" (Kerr, 1988~. This statement places an unfamiliar risk (radon exposure in homes) in juxtaposition to a more familiar risk (death in an auto accident), which may help people understand the magnitude of this unfamiliar risk. But this simple comparison may be misleading because it does not specify the respective levels of exposure, leaves out potentially relevant nonlethal consequences, and uses language (picocuries per liter) unfamiliar to most people. This report addresses these and other problems confronting risk communication. 1\nOCR for page 2\n2 IMPROVING RISK COMMUNICATION Risk messages can be controversial for many reasons. The haz- ards they describe are often themselves centers of controversy. Fre- quently, there is enough uncertainty in the underlying knowledge to allow different experts to draw contradictory conclusions. Experts are frequently accused of hiding their subjective preferences behind technical jargon and complex, so-called objective analyses. Often a message that is precise and accurate must be so complex that only an expert can understand it. Messages that nonexperts can under- stand necessarily present selected information and are thus subject to challenge as being inaccurate, incomplete, or manipulative. In the past the term risk communication has commonly been thought of as consisting only of one-way messages from experts to nonexperts. In this report the Committee on Risk Perception and Communication takes a different perspective. Because much of the controversy seems to center on the content of specific messages, it was tempting to proceed along the lines of many previous discussions about risk communication and concentrate on message design. We found a focus on one-way messages too limiting, however. Instead, we make a crucial distinction between risk messages and the risk communication process. We see risk communication as an interactive process of exchange of information and opinion among individuals, groups, and institutions. When risk communication is viewed in this way, significant, though perhaps less obvious, underlying problems can be better discerned and treated. We view success in risk communication in a different way also. Some take the position that risk communication is successful when recipients accept the views or arguments of the communicator. We construe risk communication to be successful to the extent that it raises the level of understanding of relevant issues or actions for those involved and satisfies them that they are adequately informed within the limits of available knowledge. Finally, it should be noted that one of the most difficult issues we faced concerned the extent to which public officials in a demo- cratic society should attempt to influence individuals-that is, to go beyond merely informing them concerning risks and such risk- reducing actions as quitting smoking. Government officials must be accountable for their decisions and will likely find their efforts to influence contested if they stray from accepted scientific views or if they challenge popular consensus. A public official should be aware of the political risks and of the legitimate constraints placed upon government in advocacy. Procedural strategies such as independent\nOCR for page 3\nSUMMARY 3 review processes can be used to determine the appropriateness of the use of influencing techniques. Where an unusually strong degree of advocacy seems warranted, officials should seek legitimization of such actions through the democratic process. COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT RISE COMMUNICATION Several important misconceptions need to be dispelled before the real problems of risk communication can be addressed. Con- trary to what some think, there is no single overriding problem and thus no simple way of making risk communication easy. Risk mes- sages necessarily compress technical information, which can lead to misunderstanding, confusion, and distrust. Many people including some scientists, decision makers, and members of the public-have unrealistic expectations about what can be accomplished by risk communication. For example, it is mistaken to expect improved risk communication to always reduce conflict and smooth risk management. Risk management decisions that benefit some citizens can harm others. In addition, people do not all share common interests and values, so better understanding may not lead to consensus about controversial issues or to uniform personal behavior. But even though good risk communication cannot always be expected to improve a situation, poor risk communication will nearly always make it worse. It is also mistaken to think, as some do, that if people understood and used risk comparisons it would be easy for them to make decisions. Comparing risks can help people comprehend the unfamiliar magnitudes associated with risks, but risk comparison alone cannot establish levels of acceptable risk or ensure systematic minimization of risk. Factors other than the level of risk-such as the voluntariness of exposure to the hazard and the degree of dread associated with the consequences must be considered in determining the acceptability of risk associated with a particular activity or phenomenon. Some risk communication problems derive from mistaken beliefs about scientific research on the nature of how risks are assessed and managed and on risk communication itself. Scientific information, for example, cannot be expected to resolve all important risk issues. All too often research that would answer the question has not been done or the results are disputed. Although a great deal of research has been done on the dissemination and preparation of risk messages,\nOCR for page 4\n4 IMPROVING RISK COMMUNICATION there has been much less attention devoted to the risk communication process. In addition, even when valid scientific data are available, experts are unlikely to agree completely about the meaning of these data for risk management decisions. Finally, it is unrealistic to expect easy identification and understanding of the values, preferences, and information needs of the intended recipients of risk messages. Other misconceptions involve stereotypes about the way inter- mediaries and recipients react to risk messages. It is mistaken, for example, to view journalists and the media always as significant, independent causes of problems in risk communication. Rather, the problem is often at the interface between science and journalism. Both sides need to better understand the pressures and constraints of the other instead of complaining about the sometimes disappointing results. Scientists and risk managers should recognize the importance of the part journalists play in identifying disputes and maintaining the flow of information during resolution of conflicts; journalists need to understand how to frame the technical and social dimensions of risk issues. It is also important to recognize the differences between the broadcast ant! the print media and between the national and the regional or local press corps. Finally, even though most people prefer simplicity to complex- ity, it is mistaken to expect the public to want simple, cut-and-dried answers as to what to do in every case. The public is not homoge- neous. People diner in the degree to which they exercise control over exposure to hazards or remediation of undesirable consequences, the importance they attach to various consequences, and their tendency to be risk averse or risk seeking. Often at least part of the public seeks considerable information about the risks they face. PROBLEMS OF RISK COMMUNICATION We distinguish two major types of problems in risk communica- tion. Problems deriving from institutional and political systems are problems for which little can be done beyond trying to understand them by those involved in risk communication. Nevertheless, these problems can have a considerable impact on actions and events. Problems of risk communicators and recipients can be addressed more directly and are therefore more amenable to improvement or solution.\nOCR for page 5\nSUMMARY 5 Problems Deriving Mom the Institutional and Political Systems Several kinds of legal considerations, including statutory man- dates, liability, and informed consent and \"right-to-know\" require- ments, influence the options available to risk managers and thus the content of their risk messages. These considerations generally either limit the possible responses to the risk in question or require that certain actions be taken in given circumstances. For example, some- times statutes require consideration of certain factors (the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act explicitly includes con- sideration of economic benefits) or the exclusion of others (the Clean Water Act specifies that the best available technology should be used regardless of the financial burden imposed). Although not necessar- ily problems as such, these considerations often constitute important influences on risk messages and risk communication processes. It is often difficult to understand why risk messages appear as they do without consideration of these factors. Communicating with citizens about risks can increase their desire to participate in or otherwise influence decisions about the control of those risks, thereby making risk management even more cumber- some. The interests of citizens and their motivation to participate in the political process can introduce difficult challenges when the implementation of risk control measures is necessarily decentralized and local preferences (generally to avoid exposure to a particular risk) preclude solutions in the broader interest. Many hazardous waste facilities operate under these pressures. Divided authority, not only among Congress, the executive branch, and the courts at the federal level but also among federal, state, and local or regional jurisdictions, creates incentives for each actor to gain as much leverage as possible from the limited portion he or she controls. Such fragmentation makes communicating about risks harder because it makes government regulation and risk reduc- tion programs more complex and makes it more difficult to determine who is responsible for the eventual outcomes. Government and industry spend large amounts of money on research, and thus their concerns are usually well reflected in the information developed by that research. Individuals and citizens' groups do not usually have the financial resources to fund research and thus do not enjoy this sort of access to information and influence over its generation. If a group of people that a risk corr~municator is trying to reach feels that the system for generating information relied\nOCR for page 6\n6 IMPROVING RISK COMMUNICATION upon by that source does not consider the group's concerns, it may reject the information from that source as a basis for decisions about risks. It is reasonable to speculate that this may, in part, explain why it is so difficult to affect young people's attitudes and behavior about drugs and the AIDS epidemic the information presented is based on facts that they do not consider very important in the face of their immediate concerns of peer pressure and personal image. There also may be systematic biases in the provision of informa- tion. Those most strongly motivated to communicate about risk are often also those with the ' strongest interest in the decision. When- ever a personal or social decision affects interested groups or organi- zations, conflicting messages reflecting the interests of those groups or organizations may be expected. The U.S. Environmental Protec- tion Agency administrator's statement in 1984 that EDB (ethylene dibromide)'contamination was a Tong-term health problem being ade- quately handled by tolerance guidelines, for example, was in the news at about the same time that public health officials in Massachusetts and Florida were removing grain products with EDB contamination from grocery store shelves. Experts from the food industry joined in, downplaying the risks, while scientists from environmental groups criticized the government's inaction. The beliefs, predispositions, and interests of risk communicators and the groups they represent create incentives to slant, or even distort or misrepresent, informa- tion. This can skew messages in many different directions on the same Issue. Problems of Risk Communicators and Recipients The problems encountered by the sources and recipients of risk messages center on the following topics: establishing and recognizing credibility, making the messages understandable, preparing messages in an emergency, capturing and focusing attention, and getting in- formation. Lack of credibility alters the communication process by adding distrust and acrimony. The most important factors affecting the credibility of a source and its messages relate to the accuracy of the messages and the legitimacy of the process by which the contents were determined, as perceived by the recipients. Recipients' views about the accuracy of a message are adversely affected by (1) real or perceived advocacy by the source of a position in the message that is not consistent with a careful assessment of the facts; (2)\nOCR for page 7\nSUMMARY 7 a reputation for deceit, misrepresentation, or coercion on the part , ~ . positions taken by the source that do not support the current message; (4) self-serving framing of information in the message; (5) contradictory messages from other credible sources; and (6) actual or perceived professional incompetence or impropriety on the part of the source. The perceived legitimacy of the process by which the contents of a message were determined depends on (1) the legal standing of the source with respect to the risks addressed; (2) the justification provided for the communication program; (3) the access afforded affected parties to the decision-making process; and (4) the degree to which conflicting claims are given fair and balanced review. Ideally, risk information should use language and concepts re- cipients already understand. It is difficult to present scientific and technical information that uses everyday language and magnitudes common in ordinary experience and that is sensitive to such psycho- Togical needs on the part of recipients as the desire for clear, decisive answers or the fear of the unfamiliar and unknown. Sometimes risk communicators must disseminate messages when there are not enough relevant data to allow them to draw satisfactory conclusions and there is no time to obtain better information. This usually occurs when an emergency requires that action be taken im- mediately or not at all or when events lead to requests for information prior to the completion of study or analysis. Many things compete with risk messages for attention, and it is often difficult to get the intended recipients to attend to the issues the risk communicator thinks are important. From the risk com- municator's standpoint, there are two aspects of this: stimulating the attention of the ultimate recipient and interacting with the news media and other intermediaries. There are, of course, several differ- ent ways that messages can reach the final recipients: face-to-face (physician to patient, friend to friend, within the family), in groups (work sites, cIassrooms), through professional or volunteer organi- zations (American Medical Association, Red Cross), through the mass media (radio, television, magazines, newspapers, direct mail, billboards), and through community service agencies (at libraries, hospitals, mails, fairs). Recipients of risk messages may have difficulty deciding which issues to attend to or what to do because they cannot get information from officials and other message sources that satisfactorily answers their questions. This can happen when authorities do not listen of the source; t3) previous statements or\nOCR for page 8\n8 IMPROVING RISK CO~UNICATION and therefore do not provide what the recipient considers relevant information or because the individual is unable to find a trusted source or interpreter of already available information. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS In formulating recommendations we focused on the preparation and dissemination of formal risk messages to audiences that include nonexperts and on only two of the many types of risk-managing organizations: government agencies and large private corporations. Nevertheless, our recommendations are intended to attack the prob- lems of recipients of risk messages as well. The goal cannot be only to make those who disseminate formal risk messages more effective by improving their credibility, understandability, and so on. Such an approach might serve their interests, but it could well degrade the overall quality of risk communication if it merely meant that they could advance their viewpoints with greater influence. Risk commu- nication can be improved only if recipients are also helped to solve their problems at the same time. The risk communication process usually with many messages from many sources-can be considered successful only to the extent that it, first, improves or increases the base of accurate information that decision makers use, be they government officials, industry man- agers, or individual citizens, and, second, satisfies those involved that they are adequately informed within the limits of available knowI- edge. This does not always result in the responses a particular source might wish, nor does it always lead to consensus about controver- sial issues or to uniform personal behavior. People do not all share common interests and values, and so better understanding will not necessarily lead them all to the same conclusion. Improving risk communication is therefore more than merely crafting \"better messages.\" Risk communication procedures as well as risk message content must be improved. Because risk communi- cation is so tightly linked to the management of risks, solutions to the problems of risk communication often entail changes in risk man- agement and risk analysis. Once the constraints, limitations, and incentives affecting the preparation and dissemination of messages- as well as how these factors become manifest in what we call the risk communication process-are understood, improvements can be implemented.\nOCR for page 9\nSUMMARY . \", . \u00b7 . 9 This is not to imply, however, that there is a single shortcut to improving the nation's risk communication efforts. The needed improvement can come only incrementally and only from careful attention to many details. Risk managers need to consider risk com- munication as an important and integral aspect of risk management. Four sets of recommendations are presented: (1) recommenda- tions that pertain to the processes that source organizations use to generate decisions, knowledge, and risk messages; (2) recommenda- tions that pertain to the content of individual risk messages; (3) a call for a \"consumer's guide\" that will enhance the ability of other groups or individuals to understand and participate in risk manage- ment activities; and (4) a brief summary of research needs. Two broad themes run through the process and content recom- mendations. The first is the recognition that risk communication efforts should be more systematically oriented to the intended au- diences. The most effective risk messages are those that quite self- consciously address the audiences' perspectives and concerns. The second is that openness is the surest policy. A central premise of democratic government the existence of an informed electorate- implies a free flow of information. Suppression of relevant infor- mation is not only wrong but also, over the longer term, usually ineffective. . Management of the Process We identified four process objectives that are key elements in improving risk communication: (1) goal setting, (2) openness, (3) balance, and (4) competence. Setting Realistic Goals Risk communication activities ought to be matters of conscious design. Practical goals should be established that explicitly accom- modate the political\/legal mandates and constraints bounding the process and the roles of the potential recipients of the organization's risk messages, on the one hand, and clearly show the contribution to improved understanding of issues and actions on the other. Ex- plicit consideration of such factors encourages realistic expectations, clarification of motives and objectives (both within the source orga- nization and among outside groups and individuals), and evaluation of performance.\nOCR for page 10\n10 Safeguarding Openness IMPROVING RISK COMMUNICATION Risk communication should be a two-way street. Organizations that communicate about risks should ensure effective dialogue with potentially affected outsiders. This two-way process should exhibit (1) a spirit of open exchange in a common undertaking rather than a series of \"canned\" briefings restricted to technical \"nonemotional\" issues and (2) early and sustained interchange that includes the media and other message intermediaries. Openness does not ordinarily, however' imply empowerment to determine the host organization's risk management decisions. To avoid misunderstanding, the limits of participation should be made clear from the outset. Safeguarding Balance and Accuracy in Risk Messages In order to help ensure that risk messages are not distorted and do not appear to be distorted, those who manage the generation of risk assessments and risk messages should (1) hold the preparers of messages accountable for detecting and reducing distortion; (2) consider review by recognized independent experts of the underly- ing assessment and, when feasible, the message; (3) subject draft messages, if possible, to outside preview to determine if audiences detect any overlooked distortions; and (4) prepare and release for comment a \"white paper\" on the risk assessment and risk reduction assessment. Fostering Competence Risk managers need to use procedures that incorporate two dis- tinct types of expertise: on the risk subject matter (e.g., carcinogenic risk, occupational safety) and on risk communication. Organizations that communicate about risk should take steps to ensure that the preparation of risk messages becomes a deliberate, specialized under- taking, taking care that in the process they do not sacrifice scientific quality. Such steps include (1) deliberately considering the makeup of the intended audience and demonstrating how the choice of me- dia and message reflects an understanding of the audience and its concerns; (2) attracting appropriate communications specialists and training technical staff in communications; (3) requiring systematic assurance that substantive risk experts within the organization have\nOCR for page 11\nSUMMARY 11 a voice in producing accurate assessments and the derivative risk message; (4) establishing a thoughtful program of evaluating the past performance of risk communication efforts; and (5) ensuring that their organizations improve their understanding of the roles of intermediaries, particularly media reporters and editors, including an understanding of the factors that make a risk story newsworthy, of the practical time and space constraints, and of the limited technical background of most media personnel. Risk Communication in Crisis Conditions The process for risk communication in crisis conditions requires special care. Risk managers should ensure that (l) where there is a foreseeable potential for emergency, advance plans for communica- tion are drafted, and (2) there is provision for coordinating among the various authorities that might be involved and, to the extent feasible, a single place where the public and the media can obtain authoritative and current information. Content of Risk Messages We identified four generic issues that have been the source of difficulty in the past over a broad range of risk communication efforts: (1) audience orientation, (2) uncertainty, (3) risk comparisons, and (4) completeness. Relating the Message to the Audiences' Perspectives 7 Risk messages should closely reflect the perspectives' technical capacity, and concerns of the target audiences. A message should (1) emphasize information relevant to any practical actions that in- dividuals can take; (2) be couched in clear and plain language; (3) respect the audience and its concerns; and (4) seek to inform the recipient, unless conditions clearly warrant the use of influencing techniques. One of the most difficult issues in risk communication in a democratic society is the extent to which public officials should attempt to influence individuals that is, to go beyond merely in- form~ng them concerning risks and such risk-reducing actions as quitting smoking.\nOCR for page 12\n12 Handling Uncertainty IMPROVING RISK COMMUNICATION Risk messages and supporting materials should not minimize the existence of uncertainty. Data gaps and areas of significant disagreement among experts should be disclosed. Some indication of the level of confidence of estimates and the significance of scientific uncertainty should be conveyed. Comparing Risks Risk comparisons can be helpful, but they should be presented with caution. Comparison must be seen as only one of several inputs to risk decisions, not as the primary determinant. There are proven pitfalls when risks of diverse character are compared, especially when the intent of the comparison can be seen as that of rn~nimizing a risk (by equating it to a seemingly trivial one). More useful are comparisons of risks that help convey the magnitude of a particular risk estimate, that occur in the same decision context (e.g., risks from flying and driving to a given destination), and that have a similar outcome. Multiple comparisons may avoid some of the worst pitfalls. More work needs to be done to develop constructive and helpful forms of risk comparison. Ensuring Completeness A complete information base would contain five types of infor- mation: (1) on the nature of the risk, (2) on the nature of the benefits that might be changed if risk were reduced, (3) on the avail- able alternatives, (4) on uncertainty in knowledge about risks and benefits, and (5) on management issues. There are major advantages in putting the information base into written form as an adjunct to the risk message. A Consumer's Guide to Risk and Risk Commnnication Major government and private organizations that sustain risk communication efforts should jointly fund the development of a Con- sumer's Guide to Risk and Risk Communication. The purpose of this guide would be to articulate key terms, concepts, and trade-offs in risk communication and risk management for the lay audience, to\nOCR for page 13\nSUMMARY 13 help audiences discern rn~sleading and incomplete information, and to facilitate the needed general participation in risk issues. Such a guide should (1) involve support from, but not control by, the fed- eral government and other sources of risk messages; (2) be under the editorial control of a group that is clearly oriented toward the recipients of risk messages and under administrative management by an organization that is known for its independence and familiarity with lay perspectives and that can undertake the needed outreach and public information effort; and (3) cover subjects such as the nature of risk communication, concepts of zero risk and comparative risk, evaluation of risk messages, and others designated by project participants. Research Needs As a result of our cleliberations, we have identified nine research topics for attention: (1) risk comparison, (2) risk characterization, (3) role of message intermediaries, (4) pertinency and sufficiency of risk information, (5) psychological stress, (6) the \"mental models\" of recipients, (7) risk literacy, (8) retrospective case studies of risk communication, and (9) contemporaneous assessment of risk man- agement and risk communication. Two criteria guided their selection: (1) that additional knowledge would lead to material improvement in risk communication practices and (2) that creation of such knowI- edge is likely given past results and current research methods. We have not assigned priorities among the nine topics.\nRepresentative terms from entire chapter:","id":"<urn:uuid:9f69d5bc-2625-4084-a8a2-75590717b6ec>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.nap.edu\/openbook.php?record_id=1189&page=1","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.936747551,"token_count":5575,"score":2.90625,"int_score":3}

Microbiol. [online]. 2003, vol.34, n.4, pp. 283-300. ISSN 1517-8382. http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1590\/S1517-83822003000400001.\nIt is estimated that 25 to 50% of the crops harvested worldwide are contaminated with mycotoxins. Because of the toxic and carcinogenic potential of mycotoxins, there is an urgent need to develop detection methods that are rapid and highly specific. The highly advanced physico-chemical methods for the analysis of mycotoxins in use, have the disadvantage that highly sophisticated clean-up and\/or derivatization procedures must be applied. An alternative could be the detection of the mycotoxigenic moulds themselves, especially as molecular techniques have been introduced recently as powerful tools for detecting and identifying fungi. PCR methods for the detection of aflatoxigenic Aspergilli, patulin-producing Penicillum and trichothecene- as well as fumonisin-producing Fusaria strains have been described. The usefulness of the PCR methods developed so far to monitor quality and safety in the food an feed industry was already demonstrated. Thus, PCR may be applied to the screening of agricultural commodities for the absence of mycotoxin producers prior to or even after processing. Negative results in this assay indicate that a sample should be virtually free of mycotoxins. Only the positive samples left must be analyzed for the presence of mycotoxins using physico-chemical standard methods. This review does not only summarize the so far developed qualitative and quantitative PCR assays for the detection of mycotoxigenic fungi in agricultural commodities, foods and animal feeds, but describes also strategies to develop new specific PCR assays for such a detection.\nPalabras llave : aflatoxin; fumonisin; patulin; polymerase chain reaction; trichothecene.","id":"<urn:uuid:9e0b8718-5c6a-4f7d-b008-332f3c35160f>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.scielo.br\/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&pid=S1517-83822003000400001&lng=es&nrm=iso","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.8895821571,"token_count":463,"score":2.75,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Issued from the woods of the Loess Hills a few miles east of\nNATCHEZ, MISSISSIPPI, USA\nApril 29, 2012\n|CATTLE EGRETS AMONG CATTLE\nAs in Mexico, around here if you pass by a pasture you're likely to see Cattle Egrets standing among or on the cows, as shown at http:\/\/www.backyardnature.net\/n\/12\/120429eg.jpg.\nCattle Egrets in their breeding plumage, like the ones in the picture, can be distinguished from other white egrets and herons by the patches of light orange-brown on their crests and chests. Nonbreeding Cattle Egrets can be all white, and then their relatively thick, yellow beaks and thicker, shorter necks separate them from similar-sized, white herons and egrets found here, such as Snowy Egrets and juvenile Little Blue Herons.\nI remember the first time Cattle Egrets were spotted in the rural part of western Kentucky where I grew up, possibly in 1963. Their appearance was so unusual that a farmer not particularly interested in Nature called my parents and said that a whole flock of big white birds had appeared in his pasture, and we went up to take a look. I was in college before I learned that they were Cattle Egrets, BUBULCUS IBIS.\nMy ornithology teacher told how the birds were undergoing one of the fastest and most widely ranging expansions of distribution ever seen among birds. Originally Cattle Egrets were native to southern Spain and Portugal, tropical and subtropical Africa and humid tropical and subtropical Asia. In the late 1800s they began expanding their range into southern Africa, and were first sighted in the Americas, on the boundary of Guiana and Suriname, in 1877, apparently having flown across the Atlantic Ocean. They didn't get permanently established there until the 1930s, though, but then they began expanding into much of the rest of the Americas, reaching western Kentucky around the early 60s. The species appears still to be expanding northward in western North America, but in the Northeast it seems to be in decline. Though they can turn up as far north as southern Canada, coast to coast, mostly they breed in the US Southeast.\nThe Wikipedia expert says that Cattle Egrets eat ticks and flies from cattle. They do that, but anyone who watches our birds awhile sees that mainly as the cattle move around they stir up creatures in the grass, which the egrets prey on. The cows' fresh manure also attracts flies for them.\nMATING BOX TURTLES\nIt's interesting to see how turtles manage it, but for many readers familiar with box turtles in other parts of North America the picture may raise the question of why those in our picture bear different colors and patterns than theirs. What's happening is that Box Turtles are represented by six intergrading subspecies.\nHillary's Gulf Coast location is supposed to be home to the Gulf Coast subspecies, Terrapene carolina ssp. major. However, that subspecies is described as having a brownish top shell, or carapace, sometimes with a few dull spots or rays, but nothing like these bright, yellow lines. I can't say what's going on. Apparently Box Turtle taxonomy is a bit tricky.\nRESTING CRANE FLY\nThat looks like a mosquito but you can see from how much of the leaf he covers that he's far too large to be any mosquito species found here. Also, he lacks the hypodermic-like proboscis mosquitoes use to suck blood. No conspicuous mouthparts are visible on our crane fly because adult crane flies generally hardly eat at all, only occasionally lapping up a bit of pollen or sugar-rich flower nectar. Their maggot-like larvae feed on plant roots. Some species can damage crops.\nOosterbroek's monumental, 2012 Catalogue of the Craneflies of the World -- free and online at http:\/\/ip30.eti.uva.nl\/ccw\/ --recognizes 15,345 cranefly species, 1630 of them just in our Nearctic ecozone, which embraces the US, Canada, Greenland, and most of northern Mexico.\nThat's why when I shipped the picture to volunteer identifier Bea in Ontario it took more time than usual for her verdict to come in, and she was comfortable only with calling it the genus TIPULA.\nWhatever our species, it's a pleasure to take the close shown at http:\/\/www.backyardnature.net\/n\/12\/120429cg.jpg.\nWhat are those things below the wings looking like needles with droplets of water at their ends? Those are \"halteres,\" which commonly occur among the Fly Order of Insects, the Diptera. Though their purpose isn't known with certainty, it's assumed that they help control flight, enabling flies to make sudden mid-air changes in direction. From the evolutionary perspective, halteres are modified back wings. Most insects have two pairs, or four, wings, but not the Diptera, as the name implies -- di-ptera, as they say \"two-wings\" in classical Greek.\nADMIRING THE WHITE OAK\nIn that picture I'm holding a leaf so you can see its underside, much paler than other leaves' topsides. The tree's gray bark of narrow, vertical blocks of scaly plates is shown at http:\/\/www.backyardnature.net\/n\/12\/120429qc.jpg.\nI'm accustomed to seeing White Oaks on relatively dry upland soils so I was a little surprised when the tree in the picture showed up on a stream bank growing among Sycamores. In fact, White Oaks are fairly rare around here, completely absent in many upland forests where I'd expect them to be. Years ago I mentioned this in a Newsletter and a local reader responded that in this region White Oaks were wiped out many years ago by people cutting them as lumber and, more importantly, using them in the whisky distilling business. The online Flora of North America says that \"In the past Quercus alba was considered to be the source of the finest and most durable oak lumber in America for furniture and shipbuilding.\"\nThere beside the stream, last year's crop of our White Oak's acorns had been washed away, but this season's were there in their first stages of growth, as seen at http:\/\/www.backyardnature.net\/n\/12\/120429qb.jpg.\nTraditionally early North Americans regarded the inner bark of White Oaks as highly medicinal. Extracts made from soaking the inner bark in water are astringent (puckery) and were used for gargling, and the old herbals describe the extract as tonic, stimulating and antiseptic. Other listed uses include for \"putrid sore throat,\" diphtheria, hemorrhages, spongy or bleeding gums, and hemorrhoids. Many applications suggest adding a bit of capsicum, or hot pepper, to the extract.\nBasically the notion seems to be that the bark's tannin -- the puckery element -- does the main medicinal service. Other oaks actually have more tannin than White Oak, but medicines made with them can be too harsh. White Oak extracts seem to have just the right amount.\nThe same tannin situation exists with regard to the edibility of acorns. The acorns of other oaks contain more tannin so they require more time and effort to make them edible. White Oak acorns have much less tannin, but even still there's enough to make them too bitter for humans to eat without treatment, which traditionally has been leaching acorn pulp in running water.\nBy the way, instructions for the kitchen leaching of acorn pulp appear at http:\/\/www.ehow.com\/how_8427141_leach-acorns.html.\nAMERICAN HOLLY FLOWERING\nAmerican Hollies are a different species from the English Holly often planted as ornamentals. American Holly bears larger leaves and produces fewer fruits. Hollies come in male or female trees (they're dioecious), and you can tell from the flowers in the upper, left of the above picture that here we have a male tree. A close-up of a male flower with its four out-thrusting stamens is at http:\/\/www.backyardnature.net\/n\/12\/120429hp.jpg.\nOn a female flower the stamens would be rudimentary and there'd be an ovary -- the future fruit -- in the blossom's center.\nMaybe because people are so used to seeing English Hollies planted up north often it's assumed that they're northern trees. In fact, American Holly is mainly native to the US Southeast, though along the Coastal Plain it reaches as far north as southern Connecticut. Around here it's strictly an understory tree.\nThe fruits are mildly toxic but you must eat a lot of them to get sick. Birds, deer, squirrels and other animals eat the fruits, which are drupes bearing several hard \"stones.\" No critter seems to relish them, though, saving them mostly to serve as \"emergency food\" when other foods run out. That might explain why we see hollies holding their red fruits deep into the winter.\n\"BEGGAR'S LICE\" ON MY SOCKS\nSeveral kinds of plants produce stickery little fruits like that and they all can be called Beggar's Lice. When I tracked down the plant attaching its fruits to me, it was what's shown at http:\/\/www.backyardnature.net\/n\/12\/120429my.jpg.\nSeveral beggar's-lice-producing plants are similar to that, so before being sure what I really had I had to \"do the botany.\" Here are details I focused on:\nLeaves and stems were hairy, and leaves were rounded toward the base, sometimes clasping the stem, as shown at http:\/\/www.backyardnature.net\/n\/12\/120429mw.jpg.\nA close-up of a \"beggar's louse\" is shown stuck in my arm hairs at http:\/\/www.backyardnature.net\/n\/12\/120429mx.jpg.\nThat last picture is sort of tricky. For, you expect the thing stuck to you to be a fruit with hooked spines, but the thing in the picture isn't a fruit. It's actually a baglike calyx surrounding much smaller fruit-like things. I crumbled some calyxes between my fingers and part of what resulted is shown at http:\/\/www.backyardnature.net\/n\/12\/120429mv.jpg.\nThe four shiny things are not seeds. Maybe you've seen that the ovary of most mint flowers is divided into four more-or-less distinct parts. Each of those parts is called a nutlet, and that's what you're seeing. But other plant families beside the Mint produce nutlets.\nOur beggar's-louse-producing plant is MYOSOTIS DISCOLOR, a member of the Borage Family, the Boraginaceae, which on the phylogenetic Tree of Life is adjacent to the Mint Family. Myosotis discolor is an invasive from Europe that so far has set up residence here and there in eastern and western North America, but so far seems to be absent in the center.\nThe English name is often given as Changing Forget-me-not, because Myosotis is the Forget-me-not genus, and in Latin dis-color says \"two-colored,\" apparently referring to the fact that the flowers can be white or blue, though all I've seen here are white. But, this rangy little plant you never notice until its calyxes stick to you seems to have nothing to do with Forget-me-nots, unless you look at technical features. I think some editor must have made up the name \"Changing Forget-me-not.\" Our plant very clearly is one of several \"Beggar's Lice.\"\nOATS ALONG THE ROAD\nA spikelet plucked from the panicle is shown at http:\/\/www.backyardnature.net\/n\/12\/120429ov.jpg.\nThe same spikelet opened to show the florets inside the glumes at http:\/\/www.backyardnature.net\/n\/12\/120429ou.jpg.\nThis is Oat grass, AVENA SATIVA, the same species producing the oats of oatmeal. Oat spikelets differ from those of the vast majority of other grasses by the very large, boat-shaped glumes subtending the florets.\nGlumes are analogous to a regular flower's calyx, so in that last picture of a spikelet, the glumes are the two large, green-and-white striped items at the left in the photograph. The vast majority of grass spikelets bear glumes much shorter than the florets above them. Also, notice that the slender, stiff, needlelike item, the awn, arises from a floret inside the spikelet and not from a glum.\nRemember that you can review grass flower terminology at http:\/\/www.backyardnature.net\/fl_grass.htm.\nThe spikelets of most Oat plants don't bear needlelike awns. You're likely to see both awned and awnless kinds growing as weeds in our area. When I first saw the awns I thought this might be one of the \"Wild Oat\" species, for several species reside in the Oat genus Avena, and one of those grows wild in the US Southeast. However, florets of the other species bear long, brownish hairs, and you can see that ours are hairless, or \"glabrous.\" The other species' awns also are twisted, but regular Oat awns, when present, are rigid and straight. Both Oat species are native to Eurasia.\nHow did that Oat plant make its way to the side of our isolated Mississippi backroad? Near where the grass grew there was a large game farm where exotic animals are kept so hunters can pay high fees to kill them. I'm betting that the animals are fed oats. Our plant was in an often-flooded spot downstream from the farm, so maybe an oat grain had washed there.\nThat's a roadcut through a special kind of very fine-grained clay called loess. The word loess derives from the German L\u00f6\u00df. A deep mantel of loess was deposited here at the end of the last Ice Age about 10,000 years ago. Deep loess deposits occur in a narrow band of upland immediately east of the Mississippi River over most of its entire course. The loess region sometimes is called the Loess Hills. Loess profoundly affects the area's ecology. For one thing, the farther east you go from the Mississippi River, the thinner the loess is, the poorer and more acidic the soil becomes, and the more pines you get instead of broadleaf deciduous trees.\nLoess is so important here, and so interesting, that years ago I developed a web portal called \"Loess Hills of the Lower Mississippi Valley,\" at http:\/\/www.backyardnature.net\/loess\/loess.html.\nI had hoped to engage local folks in an effort to recognize the Loess Hills as a very interesting, scenic and biologically important, distinct region with ecotourism potential, but nothing ever came from it. At that site you can learn how \"loess\" can be pronounced, how it came to exist here, what's special about it, and much more.\nOne thing special about loess is that it erodes into vertical-sided roadcuts as in the picture. People such as road engineers who try to create gentle slopes are doomed to failure. I wish my farming Maya friends in the Yucatan, who must deal with very thin, rocky soil, could see the thick mantel of rich loess we have here.\nNO MORE EMAILED NEWSLETTERS\nFrom now on, to read the Newsletters you'll just have to remember to check out the most recently issued edition at http:\/\/www.backyardnature.net\/n\/.\nToday's Newsletter is there now waiting for readers, with stories about Cattle Egrets, mating Box Turtles, craneflies, flowering holly trees, Beggar's Lice and more.\nIf you're on Facebook you can find the Facebook Newsletter page by searching for \"Jim Conrad's Naturalist Newsletter.\" The weekly message left there will link to individual pages with images embedded in text. In today's message, for instance, you can click on \"Cattle Egrets\" and see a regular web page with text and a photo. I've configured my Facebook page to have a subscribe tab but so far one hasn't appeared. My impression is that if you \"like\" the Newsletter page, each week you'll receive a message with its link. Maybe not. I'm still figuring it out.\nSo, this is the end of eleven years of weekly delivered emails.\nAt first I was upset and annoyed, and thought of writing the 2,158 subscribers suggesting that complaints be made to FatCow at email@example.com. However, something interesting has happened.\nLast week about a dozen subscribers accepted my invitation to check out the Newsletter's Facebook page. When they \"liked\" the page, I got to see their pictures, or at least their avatars. There were all kinds of folks, old and young, skinny and fat, white and brown, serious and joking, one fellow on a boat in Maine, a lady in India with a dot, or Bindi, in the middle of her forehead, someone's baby picture... What an amazing thing that all these people were interested in what I'd written!\nSo, in a way, FatCow.com's treatment has been a gift. It's resensitized me to my readership. Also, it's nudged me into a mental space where now I'm mentally prepared for the whole BackyardNature.net site to be removed permanently, for whatever reason they come up with. That extra sense of independence means a lot to me. Now if need be I'm ready to write Newsletters and just keep them in my computer, or write them in a notebook hidden in my trailer, or write them on leaves that I let float down the Mississippi River. I've already learned how to make ink from oak galls.\nSo, we're evolving here. I'm yielding when it's clear that the forces against us control critical resources, but I'm ready to experiment with new possibilities as they appear, and I continue to think, feel and write about the world around us, and share when I'm allowed to.\nGood luck in your own evolutions. And thanks for these years of weekly inviting me into your lives.\nBest wishes to all Newsletter readers,\nTo subscribe OR unsubscribe to this Newsletter, go to www.backyardnature.net\/news\/natnat.php.\nPost your own backyard-nature observations and thoughts at http:\/\/groups.google.com\/group\/backyard-nature\/\nAll previous Newsletters are archived at www.backyardnature.net\/n\/.\nVisit Jim's backyard nature site at www.backyardnature.net","id":"<urn:uuid:ed524a66-2327-4328-a7fc-f00a0d14d470>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.backyardnature.net\/n\/12\/120429.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9592416883,"token_count":4095,"score":3.59375,"int_score":4}
{"text":"Your Toddler 18 - 36 Months\n- Your 18-24 month old: Your toddler learns new things every day! He or she may carry books around and pretend to read, recognize favorite books, and develop a routine with a caregiver that involves reading.\n- By the age of 2, children have a constantly growing vocabulary of between 1,000 and 2,000 words. He or she may use words in simple combinations such as \"all done\" or \"pick up.\"\n- Your 24-36 month old: Your toddler will be speaking in sentences, and will ask and answer simple questions. He or she will imitate sounds, actions, and words in books, as well as label parts of illustrations. Your toddler will enjoy hearing his or her favorite stories read aloud repeatedly and will enjoy reading being a part of daily routines.\n- By age 3, children often demonstrate obvious enjoyment of reading, and will label items in illustrations. Toddlers at this age may also begin creating scribbles that resemble printing.\nTips for reading with your toddler:\n- Discuss the books that you read with your child. Ask who, what, where, when, why, and how questions.\n- Your child will enjoy the chance to answer questions like \"what is this animal?\" or \"what do you think will happen next?\" Be sure to give your child enough time to answer questions before telling them the answer or moving on. Counting to ten silently in your head will help you to wait long enough for a response. This will show your child that you have respect for their developing thinking and speaking skills.\n- Choose books that show characters doing things that your toddler does too (eating, playing, going to bed).\n- Keep books on low shelves so that your toddler has easy access to them.\n- Choose non-fiction books about colors, shapes, animals, families, etc.\n- Teach your toddler how to handle books correctly and carefully.\n- Share stories with repetitive text and encourage your child to repeat familiar parts along with you.\n- Recite rhymes and sing songs during daily routines.\nBooks for Toddlers:\n- Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? by Bill Martin\n- Chicka Chicka Boom Boom by Bill Martin Jr. and John Archambault\n- Freight Train by Donald Crews\n- From Head to Toe by Eric Carle\n- Gingerbread Baby by Jan Brett\n- My Car by Byron Barton\n- Planes by Byron Barton\n- The Little Red Hen by Bryon Barton\n- The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle\n- We're Going on a Bear Hunt by Michael Rosen and Helen Oxenbury","id":"<urn:uuid:4b584e78-e3d4-489e-a76b-dbbde1eadcad>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/literacynyc.org\/eightteenm.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.947761178,"token_count":545,"score":3.421875,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Let\u2019s start with the understanding that the Federal Trade Commission states that if scrap generated in the manufacturing process is reused for manufacturing new product, it can not be calculated as post-industrial recycled content, as this reuse of scrap is a part of the typical manufacturing process.
