{"text":"Wars have given us the Jeep, the computer and even the microwave.\nWill the war in Iraq give us the Tiger?\nMilitary scientists at Edgewood Chemical Biological Center at Aberdeen Proving Ground hope so. The machine - its full name is the Tactical Garbage to Energy Refinery - combines a chute, an engine, chemical tanks and other components, giving it the appearance of a lunar rover. It's designed to turn food and waste into fuel. If it works, it could save scores of American and Iraqi lives.\nAmong the biggest threats that soldiers face in the war in Iraq are the roadside bombs that have killed or maimed thousands since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. Because some military bases lack a landfill, transporting garbage to dumps miles away in the desert has become a potentially fatal routine for U.S. troops and military contractors.\nThe Tiger would attempt to solve two problems at once: It would sharply reduce those trash hauls and provide the military with an alternative source of fuel.\nIt is the latest in a long line of wartime innovations, from can openers to desert boots. The conflict in Iraq has produced innovations such as \"warlocks,\" which jam electronic signals from cell phones, garage door openers and other electronic devices that insurgents use to detonate roadside bombs, according to Inventors Digest.\n\"In wartime, you're not worried about making a profit necessarily. You're worried about getting the latest technology on the street,\" said Peter Kindsvatter, a military historian at Aberdeen Proving Ground, who added that money is spent more freely for research when a nation is at war. \"Basically, you find yourself in a technology race with your enemy.\"\nThe Tiger, now being tested in Baghdad, would not be the first device to turn garbage into energy - a large incinerator near Baltimore's downtown stadiums does it. But it would be among the first to attempt to do it on a small scale. Its creators say it could one day become widely used in civilian life, following the lead of other wartime innovations.\nDuring World War II, contractors developed the Jeep to meet the military's desire for a light, all-purpose vehicle that could transport supplies.\nThe development of radar technology to spot Nazi planes led to the microwave, according to historians.\nThe World War II era also gave birth to the first electronic digital computer, the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, or ENIAC. Funded by the Defense Department, the machine was built to compute ballistics tables that soldiers used to mechanically aim large guns. For years it was located at Aberdeen Proving Ground.\nThis decade, the Pentagon determined that garbage on military bases poses a serious logistical problem.\n\"When you're over in a combat area and people are shooting at you, you still have to deal with your trash,\" said John Spiller, project officer with the Army's Rapid Equipping Force, which is funding the Tiger project. \"How would you feel if somebody was shooting at you every other time you pushed it down the curb?\"\nHe and other Army officials said they could not recall any specific attacks against troops or contractors heading to dumpsites.For years, large incinerators have burned trash to generate power. Baltimore Refuse Energy Systems Co., the waste-to-energy plant near the stadiums, consumes up to 2,250 tons of refuse a day while producing steam and electricity.\nThe process is so expensive that it has only made sense to do it on a large scale, scientists say.\nThe military has spent almost $3 million on two Tiger prototypes, each weighing nearly 5 tons and small enough to fit into a 20- to 40-foot wide container. The project is being developed by scientists from the Edgewood, Va.-based Defense Life Sciences LLC and Indiana's Purdue University.\nThe biggest challenge was getting the parts to work together, said Donald Kennedy, an Edgewood spokesman. Because the Tiger is a hybrid consisting of a gasifier, bioreactor and generator, much of it is built with off-the-shelf items, including a grinder.\nAnother big challenge: expectations.\n\"When we would initially talk to people about the Tiger system, a large percentage would refuse to believe it could actually work,\" Kennedy wrote in an e-mail. \"Alternatively, a similar percentage would be so intrigued by the idea that they would demand to know when they could buy one for their neighborhood.\"\nThe Tiger works like this: A shredder rips up waste and soaks it in water. A bioreactor metabolizes the sludge into ethanol. A pelletizer compresses undigested waste into pellets that are fed into a gasification unit, which produces composite gas.\nThe ethanol, composite gas and a 10-percent diesel drip are injected into a diesel generator to produce electricity, according to scientists. It takes about six hours for the Tiger to power up. When it works, the device can power a 60-kilowatt generator.\nThe prototypes are being tested at Camp Victory in Baghdad\nInitial runs proved successful. The prototypes have been used to power an office trailer. At their peak, they could power two to three trailers.\nIn recent weeks, the scientists suffered a setback: The above-100 degree temperatures caused a chiller device to overheat and shut off occasionally. A new chiller from Edgewood just arrived at the site, Kennedy said.\nAfter the 90-day testing phase that ends Aug. 10, the Army will decide whether to fund the project further.\nIts developers envision the device being used to respond to crises such as Hurricane Katrina, when there is no lack of garbage but a great need for electricity.\nSpiller, of the Army's Rapid Equipping Force, said he is optimistic.\n\"The mere fact we wrote a check means we think it's got a high chance of success,\" Spiller said.","id":"<urn:uuid:749f4f2e-01bf-42ab-ac03-1dfa84af34dc>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/articles.baltimoresun.com\/2008-07-21\/news\/0807200131_1_garbage-aberdeen-proving-ground-war-in-iraq","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9598866701,"token_count":1205,"score":2.828125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"World Bulletin \/ News Desk\nWheat experts are stepping up monitoring of a crop disease first found in Africa in 1999 to minimise the spread of a deadly fungus that is also a threat in Asia, experts said on Friday.\nA \"Rust-Tracker\", using data supplied by farmers and scientists, could now monitor the fungus in 27 developing nations across 42 million hectares (103 million acres) of wheat - an area the size of Iraq or California.\n\"It's the most serious wheat disease,\" Ronnie Coffman, vice-chair of the Borlaug Global Rust Initiative (BGRI), told Reuters ahead of a meeting of wheat experts in Beijing from Sept. 1-4.\n\"If it gets started...it's like a biological firestorm,\" he said. Experts will review progress in combating the disease, with fungicides and 20 new resistant varieties developed in recent years.\nThe stem rust disease, forming reddish patches on plants like rust on metal, is known as Ug99 after it was found in Uganda in 1999. It has since spread as far as South Africa and north to Yemen and Iran.\nThe fungus, which can destroy entire wheat fields, is likely eventually to be carried worldwide on the winds. The biggest threat in coming years is a spread across Asia to Pakistan, India and China, the world's top producer, Coffman said.\n\"Effective control often depends on finding out what is happening in distant regions, and the Rust-Tracker can help scientists assess the status of stem rust and other rust diseases,\" said Dave Hodson, the developer of Rust-Tracker.\nAbout 85 percent of wheat now in production worldwide was reckoned to be vulnerable to Ug99 and its variants, the BGRI estimated. Rich nations are far less vulnerable because they can afford to switch to new varieties or deploy fungicides.\nAmong developing nations, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Egypt, India, Kenya, Nepal and Pakistan are on the front line of deploying rust-resistant varieties.\nCoffman said that relatively minor amounts of wheat output had been lost so far. \"The only country under immediate threat of a dramatic loss of production is Ethiopia,\" he said.\nIn Kenya, for instance, Ug99 had been brought largely under control because of shifts to new varieties. Another threat was from yellow rust, which has struck nations from Morocco to Uzbekistan in recent years.\nThe Ug99 fungus is among threats to food supplies. A U.N. panel of scientists says that heat waves, floods and droughts -- like the one affecting the United States this year -- are likely to become more frequent because of manmade climate change.\nScientists were also studying ways to limit a woody plant known as barberry, where the fungus also lives. Efforts to eradicate the plant in the 20th century seem to have reduced rust.\nAnd the rust had overcome a genetic resistance to the disease developed for wheat in the early 1970s by Norman Borlaug, the father of the \"Green Revolution\" that introduced higher-yielding crop varieties, Coffman said.\nHe said that rust had been known at least since Roman times. About 40 percent of the U.S. crop was destroyed in the early 1950s when rust swept up from Mexico.","id":"<urn:uuid:dc0c51bb-cc80-441a-9079-4085b22f183b>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.worldbulletin.net\/?aType=haber&ArticleID=94739","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9674349427,"token_count":658,"score":3.15625,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Wood Anemone - Dainty Spring Bloomers for the Woodland Garden\nIt's time to read and vote for your favorite article in the 2013 Write-Off Contest! The four finalist's articles are featured in the May 13 newsletter and can be found through this link. Hurry! Voting ends May 18.\nIf your garden is has dappled shade and you are looking for a lovely spring woodlander to combine with spring bulbs, Trillium and Hepatica, then try growing wood anemone, Anemone nemorosa. Available in white, pink or blue shades, this charming spring flower is sure to delight you!\n(Editor's Note: This article was originally published on June 5, 2010. Your comments are welcome, but please be aware that authors of previously published articles may not be able to promptly respond to new questions or comments.)\nOne of the harbingers of the European spring is drifts of wood anemone growing under the deciduous forests of beech, oak and maple.Botanically, wood anemones are called Anemone nemorosa. Plants produce wiry stems to 10 to 25 cm.Each stem produces a whorl of three, trisected leaves and is topped with a single 2 to 3 cm diameter flower.Each bloom normally has 6 to 8 tepals (the \u2018petals' are actually modified sepals).In the wild, white is the normal colour but pink and blue forms do exist.Plants may be grown from seed but the seed needs to be sown as soon as it is ripe (they quickly lose viability if left dry on a shelf).They require a stratification period (essentially a winter) before they will germinate.\nDue to the fussy nature of seed germination, plants are more commonly grown by division of their narrow rhizomes.If happy, wood anemone will multiply quite rapidly via underground rhizomes to produce a large-size colony.If dug after flowering, you can separate the plants into numerous plantlets. All you need is a growing stem and a couple of inches of the rhizome.\nIn the garden, wood anemones prefer dappled shade.Their soil should be moderately moist and organic-rich.They make admirable groundcovers under deciduous trees but in warm climates, may go dormant by mid summer.In cool climates, they will stay green well into September.\nWood anemones have been grown as garden ornamentals for hundreds of years.As a result of their natural variation, many named varieties now exist, most which were selected many years ago.While the wild form has small 2 to 3 cm diameter flowers, some selected forms have flowers approaching 6 cm in diameter.\nAvailability of this woodland anemone is variable. Generally you will need to seek out a specialty woodland plant nursery.\u2018Lychette' has white flowers twice the size of the wild type.Two of the largest-flowered selections include \u2018Allenii' and \u2018Robinsoniana'.Both have lavender flowers but the outside of the tepals is lilac-blue on \u2018Allenii' while the exterior is more grey-blue on \u2018Robinsoniana'.Also quite large-flowered is \u2018Blue Beauty' and \u2018Blue Bonnet', both which are pale blue. The richest blue colour is found on \u2018Royal Blue' but its flowers are a little smaller than the previous selections.\nShown above is 'Allenii' (top left), 'Robinsoniana' (top right), 'Royal Blue' (bottom left) and 'Blue Eyes' (bottom right)\n\u2018Rosea' and \u2018Westwell Pink' have very pale pink flowers that age to deep pink.One of the prettiest is \u2018Vestal'.This selection has small flowers that are white but has a double, pompom-like center.\u2018Monstrosa' has flowers double flowers that are a mix of white and green while \u2018Blue Eyes' has double white flowers with a blue center.If unusual flowers are your thing then try \u2018Green Fingers' whose white flowers have a small, central leafy tuft.More bizarre still is \u2018Bracteata' whose tepals are replaced by tiny green leaves!\nShown above is 'Vestal' (top left), 'Green Fingers' (top right), 'Monstrosa' (bottom left) and 'Westwell Pink' (bottom right)\nClosely related to wood anemone and sometimes growing in the same area isA. ranunculoides with small buttercup-yellow flowers.In areas where the two species overlap, you many encounter a natural hybrid called A. x lipsiensis.From this hybrid comes the selection \u2018Pallida' whose flowers are 3 cm and a pretty butter yellow.\nShown above is A. ranunculoides (left) and A. X lipsiensis.\nI would like to thank the following people for the use of their pictures: Galanthophile ('Green Fingers'), KMAC ('Westwell Pink'), kniphofia ('Monstrosa') and wallaby1 ('Blue Eyes').\nAbout Todd Boland\nI reside in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada.

{"text":"Are the cables in your living room creating a jungle? Don't worry \u2013 we'll help you untangle things so that Digital Television makes sense. Just pick the category that describes your problem, and we'll guide you through it \u2013 step-by-step.\nLast Updated: Thu, 09 Jun 2011 > Related Articles\nThis article addresses FAQs about HDTV including: picture quality, picture display, and common terms.\nHDTV (high definition TV) is a TV display technology that provides a higher picture and sound quality than standard TV sets.\nRoughly half of prime time TV programs of the major networks are available in the HDTV format (16:9). The other half are available in the standard-definition format (4:3). The aspect ratio of the content is controlled by the content providers; example: HBO and Showtime. You can access the providers website to see which programming is released in the HDTV format (16:9).\n- When a standard-definition (4:3 aspect ratio) program is viewed on a HDTV (16:9 aspect ratio), the HDTV centers the image on the screen with black or gray bars on either side.\n- When HDTV (16:9 aspect ratio) content is displayed on a standard-definition TV (4:3 aspect ratio), black bars will appear at the top and bottom of the screen.\nRefer to your TV user guide for directions on removing the bars. If you have a Scientific Atlanta cable box, use the stretch and zoom HD settings to fill the TV screen area with the image.\n- A TV is considered to have burn-in when the HDTV colors are not evenly displayed across the screen.\n- To avoid burn-in, use the stretch and zoom HD settings to fill the TV screen area with the image. In some cases you can substitute gray bars for black bars to minimize burn in. You can also try turning your contrast down to 50 percent or lower.\n- Burn in is usually not covered under warranty, and ONLY affects the following TV displays:\n- Direct-view CRT\n- Plasma flat-panel\n- CRT-based rear projection\nThe 4:3 aspect ratio is the shape of the standard TV monitor (square).\nThe 16:9 aspect ratio is the shape of most HDTV monitors (rectangular). HDTVs have been manufactured in both 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratios.\nWidescreen is a term used for the 16:9 aspect ratio which is larger than the standard definition TV screen.\n- 1080p is the shorthand identification for a category of HDTV video modes. The number 1080 represents 1,080 lines of vertical resolution (1,080 horizontal scan lines), while the letter p stands for progressive scan (meaning the image is not interlaced). The term usually assumes a widescreen aspect ratio of 16:9, implying a horizontal resolution of 1920 pixels.\n- 1080i is a (HDTV) video mode. The term usually assumes a widescreen aspect ratio of 16:9, implying a horizontal resolution of 1920 pixels and a frame resolution of 1920\u00d71080 or about 2.07 million pixels.\n- 720p is the shorthand name for a category of HDTV video modes. The number 720 stands for the 720 horizontal scan lines of display resolution (also known as 720 pixels of vertical resolution), while the letter p stands for progressive scan or non-interlaced.\n- 720 or 1080 lines of resolution from both the channel broadcast and the HDTV monitor (Note: A 480i DVD is not high definition, even though the image quality is considerably higher than a standard definition TV broadcast on a standard definition TV.)\n- Ability to display 16x9 aspect ratio pictures\n- Y Pb Pr video component connections from the cable receiver to the HDTV\n- Audio in the Dolby Digital (AC-3) format to support \"5.1\" surround sound\nMost HDTV monitors can display an SDTV (480i) signal. If \"sidebars\" appear, you can press the SETTINGS button on the remote control twice to access the HDTV settings. Then select the 480i Stretch setting, which will stretch the 4:3 program to fill the entire screen area.","id":"<urn:uuid:71129903-65ce-4171-bbdb-1ed8cf3c14d3>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/ww2.cox.com\/residential\/arkansas\/support\/tv\/article.cox?articleId=%7Be7126e70-6fdb-11df-ebb3-000000000000%7D","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.8435667753,"token_count":870,"score":2.515625,"int_score":3}
{"text":"A 2012 survey conducted by the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention found 52.5 percent of dogs and 58.3 percent of cats to be overweight or obese by their veterinarian. This translates to nearly 80 million dogs and cats in America with a weight problem. Dr. George Banta, chair of the Veterinary Technology department at Brown Mackie College - Akron and Dr. Mary Jo Wagner, attending veterinarian at Argosy University, Twin Cities, offer useful information for pet owners.\nHow can you tell if your pet is overweight? \u201cIt\u2019s not the number of pounds, it\u2019s how the animal carries the weight,\u201d says Banta. \u201cThe number on the Body Condition Score is more important than pounds.\u201d The Body Condition Score offers a way to assess the condition of an animal, usually on a scale from one to five, taking into account height, weight, and relative proportions of muscle and fat.\nWith a little knowledge, you can use sight and touch to figure your pet\u2019s general condition. \u201cWhen looking down on a dog or cat from above,\u201d says Banta, \u201cthe body should slim to a discernable waist. An animal is too thin if you can see the spine or ribs; however, you should be able to feel them beneath the fur.\u201d An animal of ideal weight will also display a pelvic tuck when viewed from the side.\n\u201cJust like humans, when animals overeat, they face increased risk for health problems like diabetes, heart disease, gastrointestinal problems and cancer,\u201d continues Banta. In fact, these risks also include a shortened life expectancy.\nMany owners feed pets according to the manufacturer\u2019s suggested amounts; however, this instruction may not be right for your pet. \u201cThese guidelines are meant to cover all animals of a certain weight range,\u201d says Wagner. \u201cAn owner must consider the age and activity level of each pet. The more active they are, the more calories they will burn in a day.\u201d\nMetabolism rates vary in animals the same way they do in people. Metabolism is the body process in which food is broken down for energy; another factor that affects the amount of food a pet needs. Wagner advises owners to keep an eye on body condition to judge whether a pet is eating properly. \u201cIf your pet shows signs of being overweight, simply cut back the amount of food given at each meal. Then weigh the pet in two or three weeks to see if it has made a difference,\u201d she says.\nChoosing the right food for your pet is important as well. Different brands of pet food contain varying amounts of protein, fat, carbohydrates and calories. \u201cAs a general rule, young, active dogs need high protein food,\u201d says Wagner. \u201cOlder dogs need higher fiber to keep the gastrointestinal (GI) tract moving.\u201d Ingredients listed on the package appear in descending order of volume; the first item on the list is most abundant in the food.\nMost of us love to give treats, but many of us don\u2019t realize how many we offer each day. \u201cA 40-pound dog is one quarter the size of a 160-pound person,\u201d Wagner says. \u201cThey have smaller stomachs. Look at calories in everything your pet eats. After that, it\u2019s simple math.\u201d\n\u201cTable scraps are a definite no. Zip, zilch, nada,\u201d says Banta. \u201cThey are not good for two reasons. First, foods like chocolate, caffeine, grapes and raisins can be toxic to dogs. Second, the high fat content associated with table scraps, especially holiday trimmings, can lead to the onset of acute pancreatitis, which can be fatal.\u201d\nHe recommends offering a kibble of food or a carrot instead of a cookie. If you must give cookies, try breaking them in half. \u201cPets do enjoy treats as a reward; however, attention from you is also a reward. It\u2019s important to praise animals. In some ways, spending time with them is better than a treat,\u201d Wagner says.","id":"<urn:uuid:5c0c1ba8-b765-4c27-8bb8-2a3fc0a82934>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/dvalnews.com\/matchbin_businesses?state=ME&cat=Pet%20Care&ara=Pets","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9484106302,"token_count":869,"score":3.296875,"int_score":3}

He came in looking as though he had the utmost difficulty not to burst out laughing again. Behind him Razumihin strode in gawky and awkward, shamefaced and red as a peony, with an utterly crestfallen and ferocious expression. His face and whole figure really were ridiculous at that moment and amply justified Raskolnikov\u2019s laughter. Raskolnikov, not waiting for an introduction, bowed to Porfiry Petrovitch, who stood in the middle of the room looking inquiringly at them. He held out his hand and shook hands, still apparently making desperate efforts to subdue his mirth and utter a few words to introduce himself. But he had no sooner succeeded in assuming a serious air and muttering something when he suddenly glanced again as though accidentally at Razumihin, and could no longer control himself: his stifled laughter broke out the more irresistibly the more he tried to restrain it. The extraordinary ferocity with which Razumihin received this \u201cspontaneous\u201d mirth gave the whole scene the appearance of most genuine fun and naturalness. Razumihin strengthened this impression as though on purpose.\n\u201cFool! You fiend,\u201d he roared, waving his arm which at once struck a little round table with an empty tea-glass on it. Everything was sent flying and crashing.\n\u201cBut why break chairs, gentlemen? You know it\u2019s a loss to the Crown,\u201d Porfiry Petrovitch quoted gaily.\nRaskolnikov was still laughing, with his hand in Porfiry Petrovitch\u2019s, but anxious not to overdo it, awaited the right moment to put a natural end to it. Razumihin, completely put to confusion by upsetting the table and smashing the glass, gazed gloomily at the fragments, cursed and turned sharply to the window where he stood looking out with his back to the company with a fiercely scowling countenance, seeing nothing. Porfiry Petrovitch laughed and was ready to go on laughing, but obviously looked for explanations. Zametov had been sitting in the corner, but he rose at the visitors\u2019 entrance and was standing in expectation with a smile on his lips, though he looked with surprise and even it seemed incredulity at the whole scene and at Raskolnikov with a certain embarrassment. Zametov\u2019s unexpected presence struck Raskolnikov unpleasantly.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to think of that,\u201d he thought. \u201cExcuse me, please,\u201d he began, affecting extreme embarrassment. \u201cRaskolnikov.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all, very pleasant to see you\u2026 and how pleasantly you\u2019ve come in\u2026. Why, won\u2019t he even say good-morning?\u201d Porfiry Petrovitch nodded at Razumihin.\n\u201cUpon my honour I don\u2019t know why he is in such a rage with me. I only told him as we came along that he was like Romeo\u2026 and proved it. And that was all, I think!\u201d\n\u201cPig!\u201d ejaculated Razumihin, without turning round.\n\u201cThere must have been very grave grounds for it, if he is so furious at the word,\u201d Porfiry laughed.\n\u201cOh, you sharp lawyer!... Damn you all!\u201d snapped Razumihin, and suddenly bursting out laughing himself, he went up to Porfiry with a more cheerful face as though nothing had happened. \u201cThat\u2019ll do! We are all fools. To come to business. This is my friend Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov; in the first place he has heard of you and wants to make your acquaintance, and secondly, he has a little matter of business with you. Bah! Zametov, what brought you here? Have you met before? Have you known each other long?\u201d\n\u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d thought Raskolnikov uneasily.\nZametov seemed taken aback, but not very much so.\n\u201cWhy, it was at your rooms we met yesterday,\u201d he said easily.\n\u201cThen I have been spared the trouble. All last week he was begging me to introduce him to you. Porfiry and you have sniffed each other out without me. Where is your tobacco?\u201d\nPorfiry Petrovitch was wearing a dressing-gown, very clean linen, and trodden-down slippers. He was a man of about five and thirty, short, stout even to corpulence, and clean shaven. He wore his hair cut short and had a large round head, particularly prominent at the back. His soft, round, rather snub-nosed face was of a sickly yellowish colour, but had a vigorous and rather ironical expression. It would have been good-natured except for a look in the eyes, which shone with a watery, mawkish light under almost white, blinking eyelashes. The expression of those eyes was strangely out of keeping with his somewhat womanish figure, and gave it something far more serious than could be guessed at first sight.\nAs soon as Porfiry Petrovitch heard that his visitor had a little matter of business with him, he begged him to sit down on the sofa and sat down himself on the other end, waiting for him to explain his business, with that careful and over-serious attention which is at once oppressive and embarrassing, especially to a stranger, and especially if what you are discussing is in your opinion of far too little importance for such exceptional solemnity. But in brief and coherent phrases Raskolnikov explained his business clearly and exactly, and was so well satisfied with himself that he even succeeded in taking a good look at Porfiry. Porfiry Petrovitch did not once take his eyes off him. Razumihin, sitting opposite at the same table, listened warmly and impatiently, looking from one to the other every moment with rather excessive interest.\n\u201cFool,\u201d Raskolnikov swore to himself.\n\u201cYou have to give information to the police,\u201d Porfiry replied, with a most businesslike air, \u201cthat having learnt of this incident, that is of the murder, you beg to inform the lawyer in charge of the case that such and such things belong to you, and that you desire to redeem them\u2026 or\u2026 but they will write to you.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s just the point, that at the present moment,\u201d Raskolnikov tried his utmost to feign embarrassment, \u201cI am not quite in funds\u2026 and even this trifling sum is beyond me\u2026 I only wanted, you see, for the present to declare that the things are mine, and that when I have money\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s no matter,\u201d answered Porfiry Petrovitch, receiving his explanation of his pecuniary position coldly, \u201cbut you can, if you prefer, write straight to me, to say, that having been informed of the matter, and claiming such and such as your property, you beg\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOn an ordinary sheet of paper?\u201d Raskolnikov interrupted eagerly, again interested in the financial side of the question.\n\u201cOh, the most ordinary,\u201d and suddenly Porfiry Petrovitch looked with obvious irony at him, screwing up his eyes and, as it were, winking at him. But perhaps it was Raskolnikov\u2019s fancy, for it all lasted but a moment. There was certainly something of the sort, Raskolnikov could have sworn he winked at him, goodness knows why.\n\u201cHe knows,\u201d flashed through his mind like lightning.\n\u201cForgive my troubling you about such trifles,\u201d he went on, a little disconcerted, \u201cthe things are only worth five roubles, but I prize them particularly for the sake of those from whom they came to me, and I must confess that I was alarmed when I heard\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you were so much struck when I mentioned to Zossimov that Porfiry was inquiring for everyone who had pledges!\u201d Razumihin put in with obvious intention.\nThis was really unbearable. Raskolnikov could not help glancing at him with a flash of vindictive anger in his black eyes, but immediately recollected himself.\n\u201cYou seem to be jeering at me, brother?\u201d he said to him, with a well-feigned irritability. \u201cI dare say I do seem to you absurdly anxious about such trash; but you mustn\u2019t think me selfish or grasping for that, and these two things may be anything but trash in my eyes. I told you just now that the silver watch, though it\u2019s not worth a cent, is the only thing left us of my father\u2019s. You may laugh at me, but my mother is here,\u201d he turned suddenly to Porfiry, \u201cand if she knew,\u201d he turned again hurriedly to Razumihin, carefully making his voice tremble, \u201cthat the watch was lost, she would be in despair! You know what women are!\u201d\n\u201cNot a bit of it! I didn\u2019t mean that at all! Quite the contrary!\u201d shouted Razumihin distressed.\n\u201cWas it right? Was it natural? Did I overdo it?\u201d Raskolnikov asked himself in a tremor. \u201cWhy did I say that about women?\u201d\n\u201cOh, your mother is with you?\u201d Porfiry Petrovitch inquired.\n\u201cWhen did she come?\u201d\nPorfiry paused as though reflecting.\n\u201cYour things would not in any case be lost,\u201d he went on calmly and coldly. \u201cI have been expecting you here for some time.\u201d\nAnd as though that was a matter of no importance, he carefully offered the ash-tray to Razumihin, who was ruthlessly scattering cigarette ash over the carpet. Raskolnikov shuddered, but Porfiry did not seem to be looking at him, and was still concerned with Razumihin\u2019s cigarette.\n\u201cWhat? Expecting him? Why, did you know that he had pledges there?\u201d cried Razumihin.\nPorfiry Petrovitch addressed himself to Raskolnikov.\n\u201cYour things, the ring and the watch, were wrapped up together, and on the paper your name was legibly written in pencil, together with the date on which you left them with her\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHow observant you are!\u201d Raskolnikov smiled awkwardly, doing his very utmost to look him straight in the face, but he failed, and suddenly added:\n\u201cI say that because I suppose there were a great many pledges\u2026 that it must be difficult to remember them all\u2026. But you remember them all so clearly, and\u2026 and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cStupid! Feeble!\u201d he thought. \u201cWhy did I add that?\u201d\n\u201cBut we know all who had pledges, and you are the only one who hasn\u2019t come forward,\u201d Porfiry answered with hardly perceptible irony.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been quite well.\u201d\n\u201cI heard that too. I heard, indeed, that you were in great distress about something. You look pale still.\u201d\n\u201cI am not pale at all\u2026. No, I am quite well,\u201d Raskolnikov snapped out rudely and angrily, completely changing his tone. His anger was mounting, he could not repress it. \u201cAnd in my anger I shall betray myself,\u201d flashed through his mind again. \u201cWhy are they torturing me?\u201d\n\u201cNot quite well!\u201d Razumihin caught him up. \u201cWhat next! He was unconscious and delirious all yesterday. Would you believe, Porfiry, as soon as our backs were turned, he dressed, though he could hardly stand, and gave us the slip and went off on a spree somewhere till midnight, delirious all the time! Would you believe it! Extraordinary!\u201d\n\u201cReally delirious? You don\u2019t say so!\u201d Porfiry shook his head in a womanish way.\n\u201cNonsense! Don\u2019t you believe it! But you don\u2019t believe it anyway,\u201d Raskolnikov let slip in his anger. But Porfiry Petrovitch did not seem to catch those strange words.\n\u201cBut how could you have gone out if you hadn\u2019t been delirious?\u201d Razumihin got hot suddenly. \u201cWhat did you go out for? What was the object of it? And why on the sly? Were you in your senses when you did it? Now that all danger is over I can speak plainly.\u201d\n\u201cI was awfully sick of them yesterday.\u201d Raskolnikov addressed Porfiry suddenly with a smile of insolent defiance, \u201cI ran away from them to take lodgings where they wouldn\u2019t find me, and took a lot of money with me. Mr. Zametov there saw it. I say, Mr. Zametov, was I sensible or delirious yesterday; settle our dispute.\u201d\nHe could have strangled Zametov at that moment, so hateful were his expression and his silence to him.\n\u201cIn my opinion you talked sensibly and even artfully, but you were extremely irritable,\u201d Zametov pronounced dryly.\n\u201cAnd Nikodim Fomitch was telling me to-day,\u201d put in Porfiry Petrovitch, \u201cthat he met you very late last night in the lodging of a man who had been run over.\u201d\n\u201cAnd there,\u201d said Razumihin, \u201cweren\u2019t you mad then? You gave your last penny to the widow for the funeral. If you wanted to help, give fifteen or twenty even, but keep three roubles for yourself at least, but he flung away all the twenty-five at once!\u201d\n\u201cMaybe I found a treasure somewhere and you know nothing of it? So that\u2019s why I was liberal yesterday\u2026. Mr. Zametov knows I\u2019ve found a treasure! Excuse us, please, for disturbing you for half an hour with such trivialities,\u201d he said, turning to Porfiry Petrovitch, with trembling lips. \u201cWe are boring you, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n\u201cOh no, quite the contrary, quite the contrary! If only you knew how you interest me! It\u2019s interesting to look on and listen\u2026 and I am really glad you have come forward at last.\u201d\n\u201cBut you might give us some tea! My throat\u2019s dry,\u201d cried Razumihin.\n\u201cCapital idea! Perhaps we will all keep you company. Wouldn\u2019t you like\u2026 something more essential before tea?\u201d\n\u201cGet along with you!\u201d\nPorfiry Petrovitch went out to order tea.\nRaskolnikov\u2019s thoughts were in a whirl. He was in terrible exasperation.\n\u201cThe worst of it is they don\u2019t disguise it; they don\u2019t care to stand on ceremony! And how if you didn\u2019t know me at all, did you come to talk to Nikodim Fomitch about me? So they don\u2019t care to hide that they are tracking me like a pack of dogs. They simply spit in my face.\u201d He was shaking with rage. \u201cCome, strike me openly, don\u2019t play with me like a cat with a mouse. It\u2019s hardly civil, Porfiry Petrovitch, but perhaps I won\u2019t allow it! I shall get up and throw the whole truth in your ugly faces, and you\u2019ll see how I despise you.\u201d He could hardly breathe. \u201cAnd what if it\u2019s only my fancy? What if I am mistaken, and through inexperience I get angry and don\u2019t keep up my nasty part? Perhaps it\u2019s all unintentional. All their phrases are the usual ones, but there is something about them\u2026. It all might be said, but there is something. Why did he say bluntly, \u2018With her\u2019? Why did Zametov add that I spoke artfully? Why do they speak in that tone? Yes, the tone\u2026. Razumihin is sitting here, why does he see nothing? That innocent blockhead never does see anything! Feverish again! Did Porfiry wink at me just now? Of course it\u2019s nonsense! What could he wink for? Are they trying to upset my nerves or are they teasing me? Either it\u2019s ill fancy or they know! Even Zametov is rude\u2026. Is Zametov rude? Zametov has changed his mind. I foresaw he would change his mind! He is at home here, while it\u2019s my first visit. Porfiry does not consider him a visitor; sits with his back to him. They\u2019re as thick as thieves, no doubt, over me! Not a doubt they were talking about me before we came. Do they know about the flat? If only they\u2019d make haste! When I said that I ran away to take a flat he let it pass\u2026. I put that in cleverly about a flat, it may be of use afterwards\u2026. Delirious, indeed\u2026 ha-ha-ha! He knows all about last night! He didn\u2019t know of my mother\u2019s arrival! The hag had written the date on in pencil! You are wrong, you won\u2019t catch me! There are no facts\u2026 it\u2019s all supposition! You produce facts! The flat even isn\u2019t a fact but delirium. I know what to say to them\u2026. Do they know about the flat? I won\u2019t go without finding out. What did I come for? But my being angry now, maybe is a fact! Fool, how irritable I am! Perhaps that\u2019s right; to play the invalid\u2026. He is feeling me. He will try to catch me. Why did I come?\u201d\nAll this flashed like lightning through his mind.\nPorfiry Petrovitch returned quickly. He became suddenly more jovial.\n\u201cYour party yesterday, brother, has left my head rather\u2026. And I am out of sorts altogether,\u201d he began in quite a different tone, laughing to Razumihin.\n\u201cWas it interesting? I left you yesterday at the most interesting point. Who got the best of it?\u201d\n\u201cOh, no one, of course. They got on to everlasting questions, floated off into space.\u201d\n\u201cOnly fancy, Rodya, what we got on to yesterday. Whether there is such a thing as crime. I told you that we talked our heads off.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is there strange? It\u2019s an everyday social question,\u201d Raskolnikov answered casually.\n\u201cThe question wasn\u2019t put quite like that,\u201d observed Porfiry.\n\u201cNot quite, that\u2019s true,\u201d Razumihin agreed at once, getting warm and hurried as usual. \u201cListen, Rodion, and tell us your opinion, I want to hear it. I was fighting tooth and nail with them and wanted you to help me. I told them you were coming\u2026. It began with the socialist doctrine. You know their doctrine; crime is a protest against the abnormality of the social organisation and nothing more, and nothing more; no other causes admitted!...\u201d\n\u201cYou are wrong there,\u201d cried Porfiry Petrovitch; he was noticeably animated and kept laughing as he looked at Razumihin, which made him more excited than ever.\n\u201cNothing is admitted,\u201d Razumihin interrupted with heat.\n\u201cI am not wrong. I\u2019ll show you their pamphlets. Everything with them is \u2018the influence of environment,\u2019 and nothing else. Their favourite phrase! From which it follows that, if society is normally organised, all crime will cease at once, since there will be nothing to protest against and all men will become righteous in one instant. Human nature is not taken into account, it is excluded, it\u2019s not supposed to exist! They don\u2019t recognise that humanity, developing by a historical living process, will become at last a normal society, but they believe that a social system that has come out of some mathematical brain is going to organise all humanity at once and make it just and sinless in an instant, quicker than any living process! That\u2019s why they instinctively dislike history, \u2018nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it,\u2019 and they explain it all as stupidity! That\u2019s why they so dislike the living process of life; they don\u2019t want a living soul! The living soul demands life, the soul won\u2019t obey the rules of mechanics, the soul is an object of suspicion, the soul is retrograde! But what they want though it smells of death and can be made of India-rubber, at least is not alive, has no will, is servile and won\u2019t revolt! And it comes in the end to their reducing everything to the building of walls and the planning of rooms and passages in a phalanstery! The phalanstery is ready, indeed, but your human nature is not ready for the phalanstery\u2014it wants life, it hasn\u2019t completed its vital process, it\u2019s too soon for the graveyard! You can\u2019t skip over nature by logic. Logic presupposes three possibilities, but there are millions! Cut away a million, and reduce it all to the question of comfort! That\u2019s the easiest solution of the problem! It\u2019s seductively clear and you musn\u2019t think about it. That\u2019s the great thing, you mustn\u2019t think! The whole secret of life in two pages of print!\u201d\n\u201cNow he is off, beating the drum! Catch hold of him, do!\u201d laughed Porfiry. \u201cCan you imagine,\u201d he turned to Raskolnikov, \u201csix people holding forth like that last night, in one room, with punch as a preliminary! No, brother, you are wrong, environment accounts for a great deal in crime; I can assure you of that.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I know it does, but just tell me: a man of forty violates a child of ten; was it environment drove him to it?\u201d\n\u201cWell, strictly speaking, it did,\u201d Porfiry observed with noteworthy gravity; \u201ca crime of that nature may be very well ascribed to the influence of environment.\u201d\nRazumihin was almost in a frenzy. \u201cOh, if you like,\u201d he roared. \u201cI\u2019ll prove to you that your white eyelashes may very well be ascribed to the Church of Ivan the Great\u2019s being two hundred and fifty feet high, and I will prove it clearly, exactly, progressively, and even with a Liberal tendency! I undertake to! Will you bet on it?\u201d\n\u201cDone! Let\u2019s hear, please, how he will prove it!\u201d\n\u201cHe is always humbugging, confound him,\u201d cried Razumihin, jumping up and gesticulating. \u201cWhat\u2019s the use of talking to you? He does all that on purpose; you don\u2019t know him, Rodion! He took their side yesterday, simply to make fools of them. And the things he said yesterday! And they were delighted! He can keep it up for a fortnight together. Last year he persuaded us that he was going into a monastery: he stuck to it for two months. Not long ago he took it into his head to declare he was going to get married, that he had everything ready for the wedding. He ordered new clothes indeed. We all began to congratulate him. There was no bride, nothing, all pure fantasy!\u201d\n\u201cAh, you are wrong! I got the clothes before. It was the new clothes in fact that made me think of taking you in.\u201d\n\u201cAre you such a good dissembler?\u201d Raskolnikov asked carelessly.\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have supposed it, eh? Wait a bit, I shall take you in, too. Ha-ha-ha! No, I\u2019ll tell you the truth. All these questions about crime, environment, children, recall to my mind an article of yours which interested me at the time. \u2018On Crime\u2019... or something of the sort, I forget the title, I read it with pleasure two months ago in the Periodical Review.\u201d\n\u201cMy article? In the Periodical Review?\u201d Raskolnikov asked in astonishment. \u201cI certainly did write an article upon a book six months ago when I left the university, but I sent it to the Weekly Review.\u201d\n\u201cBut it came out in the Periodical.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the Weekly Review ceased to exist, so that\u2019s why it wasn\u2019t printed at the time.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s true; but when it ceased to exist, the Weekly Review was amalgamated with the Periodical, and so your article appeared two months ago in the latter. Didn\u2019t you know?\u201d\nRaskolnikov had not known.\n\u201cWhy, you might get some money out of them for the article! What a strange person you are! You lead such a solitary life that you know nothing of matters that concern you directly. It\u2019s a fact, I assure you.\u201d\n\u201cBravo, Rodya! I knew nothing about it either!\u201d cried Razumihin. \u201cI\u2019ll run to-day to the reading-room and ask for the number. Two months ago? What was the date? It doesn\u2019t matter though, I will find it. Think of not telling us!\u201d\n\u201cHow did you find out that the article was mine? It\u2019s only signed with an initial.\u201d\n\u201cI only learnt it by chance, the other day. Through the editor; I know him\u2026. I was very much interested.\u201d\n\u201cI analysed, if I remember, the psychology of a criminal before and after the crime.\u201d\n\u201cYes, and you maintained that the perpetration of a crime is always accompanied by illness. Very, very original, but\u2026 it was not that part of your article that interested me so much, but an idea at the end of the article which I regret to say you merely suggested without working it out clearly. There is, if you recollect, a suggestion that there are certain persons who can\u2026 that is, not precisely are able to, but have a perfect right to commit breaches of morality and crimes, and that the law is not for them.\u201d\nRaskolnikov smiled at the exaggerated and intentional distortion of his idea.\n\u201cWhat? What do you mean? A right to crime? But not because of the influence of environment?\u201d Razumihin inquired with some alarm even.\n\u201cNo, not exactly because of it,\u201d answered Porfiry. \u201cIn his article all men are divided into \u2018ordinary\u2019 and \u2018extraordinary.\u2019 Ordinary men have to live in submission, have no right to transgress the law, because, don\u2019t you see, they are ordinary. But extraordinary men have a right to commit any crime and to transgress the law in any way, just because they are extraordinary. That was your idea, if I am not mistaken?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean? That can\u2019t be right?\u201d Razumihin muttered in bewilderment.\nRaskolnikov smiled again. He saw the point at once, and knew where they wanted to drive him. He decided to take up the challenge.\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t quite my contention,\u201d he began simply and modestly. \u201cYet I admit that you have stated it almost correctly; perhaps, if you like, perfectly so.\u201d (It almost gave him pleasure to admit this.) \u201cThe only difference is that I don\u2019t contend that extraordinary people are always bound to commit breaches of morals, as you call it. In fact, I doubt whether such an argument could be published. I simply hinted that an \u2018extraordinary\u2019 man has the right\u2026 that is not an official right, but an inner right to decide in his own conscience to overstep\u2026 certain obstacles, and only in case it is essential for the practical fulfilment of his idea (sometimes, perhaps, of benefit to the whole of humanity). You say that my article isn\u2019t definite; I am ready to make it as clear as I can. Perhaps I am right in thinking you want me to; very well. I maintain that if the discoveries of Kepler and Newton could not have been made known except by sacrificing the lives of one, a dozen, a hundred, or more men, Newton would have had the right, would indeed have been in duty bound\u2026 to eliminate the dozen or the hundred men for the sake of making his discoveries known to the whole of humanity. But it does not follow from that that Newton had a right to murder people right and left and to steal every day in the market. Then, I remember, I maintain in my article that all\u2026 well, legislators and leaders of men, such as Lycurgus, Solon, Mahomet, Napoleon, and so on, were all without exception criminals, from the very fact that, making a new law, they transgressed the ancient one, handed down from their ancestors and held sacred by the people, and they did not stop short at bloodshed either, if that bloodshed\u2014often of innocent persons fighting bravely in defence of ancient law\u2014were of use to their cause. It\u2019s remarkable, in fact, that the majority, indeed, of these benefactors and leaders of humanity were guilty of terrible carnage. In short, I maintain that all great men or even men a little out of the common, that is to say capable of giving some new word, must from their very nature be criminals\u2014more or less, of course. Otherwise it\u2019s hard for them to get out of the common rut; and to remain in the common rut is what they can\u2019t submit to, from their very nature again, and to my mind they ought not, indeed, to submit to it. You see that there is nothing particularly new in all that. The same thing has been printed and read a thousand times before. As for my division of people into ordinary and extraordinary, I acknowledge that it\u2019s somewhat arbitrary, but I don\u2019t insist upon exact numbers. I only believe in my leading idea that men are in general divided by a law of nature into two categories, inferior (ordinary), that is, so to say, material that serves only to reproduce its kind, and men who have the gift or the talent to utter a new word. There are, of course, innumerable sub-divisions, but the distinguishing features of both categories are fairly well marked. The first category, generally speaking, are men conservative in temperament and law-abiding; they live under control and love to be controlled. To my thinking it is their duty to be controlled, because that\u2019s their vocation, and there is nothing humiliating in it for them. The second category all transgress the law; they are destroyers or disposed to destruction according to their capacities. The crimes of these men are of course relative and varied; for the most part they seek in very varied ways the destruction of the present for the sake of the better. But if such a one is forced for the sake of his idea to step over a corpse or wade through blood, he can, I maintain, find within himself, in his conscience, a sanction for wading through blood\u2014that depends on the idea and its dimensions, note that. It\u2019s only in that sense I speak of their right to crime in my article (you remember it began with the legal question). There\u2019s no need for such anxiety, however; the masses will scarcely ever admit this right, they punish them or hang them (more or less), and in doing so fulfil quite justly their conservative vocation. But the same masses set these criminals on a pedestal in the next generation and worship them (more or less). The first category is always the man of the present, the second the man of the future. The first preserve the world and people it, the second move the world and lead it to its goal. Each class has an equal right to exist. In fact, all have equal rights with me\u2014and _vive la guerre \u00e9ternelle_\u2014till the New Jerusalem, of course!\u201d\n\u201cThen you believe in the New Jerusalem, do you?\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d Raskolnikov answered firmly; as he said these words and during the whole preceding tirade he kept his eyes on one spot on the carpet.\n\u201cAnd\u2026 and do you believe in God? Excuse my curiosity.\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d repeated Raskolnikov, raising his eyes to Porfiry.\n\u201cAnd\u2026 do you believe in Lazarus\u2019 rising from the dead?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 I do. Why do you ask all this?\u201d\n\u201cYou believe it literally?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t say so\u2026. I asked from curiosity. Excuse me. But let us go back to the question; they are not always executed. Some, on the contrary\u2026\u201d\n\u201cTriumph in their lifetime? Oh, yes, some attain their ends in this life, and then\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThey begin executing other people?\u201d\n\u201cIf it\u2019s necessary; indeed, for the most part they do. Your remark is very witty.\u201d\n\u201cThank you. But tell me this: how do you distinguish those extraordinary people from the ordinary ones? Are there signs at their birth? I feel there ought to be more exactitude, more external definition. Excuse the natural anxiety of a practical law-abiding citizen, but couldn\u2019t they adopt a special uniform, for instance, couldn\u2019t they wear something, be branded in some way? For you know if confusion arises and a member of one category imagines that he belongs to the other, begins to \u2018eliminate obstacles\u2019 as you so happily expressed it, then\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh, that very often happens! That remark is wittier than the other.\u201d\n\u201cNo reason to; but take note that the mistake can only arise in the first category, that is among the ordinary people (as I perhaps unfortunately called them). In spite of their predisposition to obedience very many of them, through a playfulness of nature, sometimes vouchsafed even to the cow, like to imagine themselves advanced people, \u2018destroyers,\u2019 and to push themselves into the \u2018new movement,\u2019 and this quite sincerely. Meanwhile the really new people are very often unobserved by them, or even despised as reactionaries of grovelling tendencies. But I don\u2019t think there is any considerable danger here, and you really need not be uneasy for they never go very far. Of course, they might have a thrashing sometimes for letting their fancy run away with them and to teach them their place, but no more; in fact, even this isn\u2019t necessary as they castigate themselves, for they are very conscientious: some perform this service for one another and others chastise themselves with their own hands\u2026. They will impose various public acts of penitence upon themselves with a beautiful and edifying effect; in fact you\u2019ve nothing to be uneasy about\u2026. It\u2019s a law of nature.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you have certainly set my mind more at rest on that score; but there\u2019s another thing worries me. Tell me, please, are there many people who have the right to kill others, these extraordinary people? I am ready to bow down to them, of course, but you must admit it\u2019s alarming if there are a great many of them, eh?\u201d\n\u201cOh, you needn\u2019t worry about that either,\u201d Raskolnikov went on in the same tone. \u201cPeople with new ideas, people with the faintest capacity for saying something new, are extremely few in number, extraordinarily so in fact. One thing only is clear, that the appearance of all these grades and sub-divisions of men must follow with unfailing regularity some law of nature. That law, of course, is unknown at present, but I am convinced that it exists, and one day may become known. The vast mass of mankind is mere material, and only exists in order by some great effort, by some mysterious process, by means of some crossing of races and stocks, to bring into the world at last perhaps one man out of a thousand with a spark of independence. One in ten thousand perhaps\u2014I speak roughly, approximately\u2014is born with some independence, and with still greater independence one in a hundred thousand. The man of genius is one of millions, and the great geniuses, the crown of humanity, appear on earth perhaps one in many thousand millions. In fact I have not peeped into the retort in which all this takes place. But there certainly is and must be a definite law, it cannot be a matter of chance.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, are you both joking?\u201d Razumihin cried at last. \u201cThere you sit, making fun of one another. Are you serious, Rodya?\u201d\nRaskolnikov raised his pale and almost mournful face and made no reply. And the unconcealed, persistent, nervous, and discourteous sarcasm of Porfiry seemed strange to Razumihin beside that quiet and mournful face.\n\u201cWell, brother, if you are really serious\u2026 You are right, of course, in saying that it\u2019s not new, that it\u2019s like what we\u2019ve read and heard a thousand times already; but what is really original in all this, and is exclusively your own, to my horror, is that you sanction bloodshed in the name of conscience, and, excuse my saying so, with such fanaticism\u2026. That, I take it, is the point of your article. But that sanction of bloodshed by conscience is to my mind\u2026 more terrible than the official, legal sanction of bloodshed\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cYou are quite right, it is more terrible,\u201d Porfiry agreed.\n\u201cYes, you must have exaggerated! There is some mistake, I shall read it. You can\u2019t think that! I shall read it.\u201d\n\u201cAll that is not in the article, there\u2019s only a hint of it,\u201d said Raskolnikov.\n\u201cYes, yes.\u201d Porfiry couldn\u2019t sit still. \u201cYour attitude to crime is pretty clear to me now, but\u2026 excuse me for my impertinence (I am really ashamed to be worrying you like this), you see, you\u2019ve removed my anxiety as to the two grades getting mixed, but\u2026 there are various practical possibilities that make me uneasy! What if some man or youth imagines that he is a Lycurgus or Mahomet\u2014a future one of course\u2014and suppose he begins to remove all obstacles\u2026. He has some great enterprise before him and needs money for it\u2026 and tries to get it\u2026 do you see?\u201d\nZametov gave a sudden guffaw in his corner. Raskolnikov did not even raise his eyes to him.\n\u201cI must admit,\u201d he went on calmly, \u201cthat such cases certainly must arise. The vain and foolish are particularly apt to fall into that snare; young people especially.\u201d\n\u201cYes, you see. Well then?\u201d\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d Raskolnikov smiled in reply; \u201cthat\u2019s not my fault. So it is and so it always will be. He said just now (he nodded at Razumihin) that I sanction bloodshed. Society is too well protected by prisons, banishment, criminal investigators, penal servitude. There\u2019s no need to be uneasy. You have but to catch the thief.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what if we do catch him?\u201d\n\u201cThen he gets what he deserves.\u201d\n\u201cYou are certainly logical. But what of his conscience?\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you care about that?\u201d\n\u201cSimply from humanity.\u201d\n\u201cIf he has a conscience he will suffer for his mistake. That will be his punishment\u2014as well as the prison.\u201d\n\u201cBut the real geniuses,\u201d asked Razumihin frowning, \u201cthose who have the right to murder? Oughtn\u2019t they to suffer at all even for the blood they\u2019ve shed?\u201d\n\u201cWhy the word ought? It\u2019s not a matter of permission or prohibition. He will suffer if he is sorry for his victim. Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart. The really great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth,\u201d he added dreamily, not in the tone of the conversation.\nHe raised his eyes, looked earnestly at them all, smiled, and took his cap. He was too quiet by comparison with his manner at his entrance, and he felt this. Everyone got up.\n\u201cWell, you may abuse me, be angry with me if you like,\u201d Porfiry Petrovitch began again, \u201cbut I can\u2019t resist. Allow me one little question (I know I am troubling you). There is just one little notion I want to express, simply that I may not forget it.\u201d\n\u201cVery good, tell me your little notion,\u201d Raskolnikov stood waiting, pale and grave before him.\n\u201cWell, you see\u2026 I really don\u2019t know how to express it properly\u2026. It\u2019s a playful, psychological idea\u2026. When you were writing your article, surely you couldn\u2019t have helped, he-he! fancying yourself\u2026 just a little, an \u2018extraordinary\u2019 man, uttering a new word in your sense\u2026. That\u2019s so, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cQuite possibly,\u201d Raskolnikov answered contemptuously.\nRazumihin made a movement.\n\u201cAnd, if so, could you bring yourself in case of worldly difficulties and hardship or for some service to humanity\u2014to overstep obstacles?... For instance, to rob and murder?\u201d\nAnd again he winked with his left eye, and laughed noiselessly just as before.\n\u201cIf I did I certainly should not tell you,\u201d Raskolnikov answered with defiant and haughty contempt.\n\u201cNo, I was only interested on account of your article, from a literary point of view\u2026\u201d\n\u201cFoo! how obvious and insolent that is!\u201d Raskolnikov thought with repulsion.\n\u201cAllow me to observe,\u201d he answered dryly, \u201cthat I don\u2019t consider myself a Mahomet or a Napoleon, nor any personage of that kind, and not being one of them I cannot tell you how I should act.\u201d\n\u201cOh, come, don\u2019t we all think ourselves Napoleons now in Russia?\u201d Porfiry Petrovitch said with alarming familiarity.\nSomething peculiar betrayed itself in the very intonation of his voice.\n\u201cPerhaps it was one of these future Napoleons who did for Alyona Ivanovna last week?\u201d Zametov blurted out from the corner.\nRaskolnikov did not speak, but looked firmly and intently at Porfiry. Razumihin was scowling gloomily. He seemed before this to be noticing something. He looked angrily around. There was a minute of gloomy silence. Raskolnikov turned to go.\n\u201cAre you going already?\u201d Porfiry said amiably, holding out his hand with excessive politeness. \u201cVery, very glad of your acquaintance. As for your request, have no uneasiness, write just as I told you, or, better still, come to me there yourself in a day or two\u2026 to-morrow, indeed. I shall be there at eleven o\u2019clock for certain. We\u2019ll arrange it all; we\u2019ll have a talk. As one of the last to be there, you might perhaps be able to tell us something,\u201d he added with a most good-natured expression.\n\u201cYou want to cross-examine me officially in due form?\u201d Raskolnikov asked sharply.\n\u201cOh, why? That\u2019s not necessary for the present. You misunderstand me. I lose no opportunity, you see, and\u2026 I\u2019ve talked with all who had pledges\u2026. I obtained evidence from some of them, and you are the last\u2026. Yes, by the way,\u201d he cried, seemingly suddenly delighted, \u201cI just remember, what was I thinking of?\u201d he turned to Razumihin, \u201cyou were talking my ears off about that Nikolay\u2026 of course, I know, I know very well,\u201d he turned to Raskolnikov, \u201cthat the fellow is innocent, but what is one to do? We had to trouble Dmitri too\u2026. This is the point, this is all: when you went up the stairs it was past seven, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d answered Raskolnikov, with an unpleasant sensation at the very moment he spoke that he need not have said it.\n\u201cThen when you went upstairs between seven and eight, didn\u2019t you see in a flat that stood open on a second storey, do you remember? two workmen or at least one of them? They were painting there, didn\u2019t you notice them? It\u2019s very, very important for them.\u201d\n\u201cPainters? No, I didn\u2019t see them,\u201d Raskolnikov answered slowly, as though ransacking his memory, while at the same instant he was racking every nerve, almost swooning with anxiety to conjecture as quickly as possible where the trap lay and not to overlook anything. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t see them, and I don\u2019t think I noticed a flat like that open\u2026. But on the fourth storey\u201d (he had mastered the trap now and was triumphant) \u201cI remember now that someone was moving out of the flat opposite Alyona Ivanovna\u2019s\u2026. I remember\u2026 I remember it clearly. Some porters were carrying out a sofa and they squeezed me against the wall. But painters\u2026 no, I don\u2019t remember that there were any painters, and I don\u2019t think that there was a flat open anywhere, no, there wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Razumihin shouted suddenly, as though he had reflected and realised. \u201cWhy, it was on the day of the murder the painters were at work, and he was there three days before? What are you asking?\u201d\n\u201cFoo! I have muddled it!\u201d Porfiry slapped himself on the forehead. \u201cDeuce take it! This business is turning my brain!\u201d he addressed Raskolnikov somewhat apologetically. \u201cIt would be such a great thing for us to find out whether anyone had seen them between seven and eight at the flat, so I fancied you could perhaps have told us something\u2026. I quite muddled it.\u201d\n\u201cThen you should be more careful,\u201d Razumihin observed grimly.\nThe last words were uttered in the passage. Porfiry Petrovitch saw them to the door with excessive politeness.\nThey went out into the street gloomy and sullen, and for some steps they did not say a word. Raskolnikov drew a deep breath.","id":"<urn:uuid:842792ff-9ed5-4959-9a6a-526b7eed61ac>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/etc.usf.edu\/lit2go\/182\/crime-and-punishment\/3410\/part-3-chapter-5\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9757550955,"token_count":10724,"score":2.609375,"int_score":3}

{"text":"The press release doesn\u2019t contain any pictures, and really doesn\u2019t do this new web tool justice, so I\u2019ve added some screencaps. In a nutshell, the new iSWA site lets you arrange graphical packages of solar images and plots oncsreen for simultaneous evaluation. Stuff that had been scattered over several solar related websites is now in one interface. Pretty cool. \u2013 Anthony\nWhen NASA\u2019s satellite operators need accurate, real-time space-weather information, they turn to the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) of the Space Weather Laboratory at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. The CCMC\u2019s newest and most advanced space-weather science tool is the Integrated Space Weather Analysis (iSWA) system.\nThe iSWA is a robust, integrated system provides information about space weather conditions past, present, and future and, unlike many other programs currently in use, has an interface that the user can customize to suit a unique set of data requirements.\n\u201cThe iSWA space-weather data analysis system offers a unique level of customization and flexibility to maintain, modify, and add new tools and data products as they become available,\u201d says Marlo Maddox, iSWA system chief developer at NASA Goddard.\niSWA draws together information about conditions from the sun to the boundary of the sun\u2019s influence, known as the heliosphere. The iSWA systems digests information from spacecraft including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s (NOAA) Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES), NASA\u2019s Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), the joint European Space Agency and NASA mission Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), and NASA\u2019s Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE).\nCitizen scientists and science enthusiasts can also use the data, models, and tools of the iSWA system. Similar to the way in which armchair astronomers have used SOHO data to discover comets, enthusiasts will find the iSWA system a wonderful resource for increasing their familiarity with the concept of space weather.\n\u201cWe are continuously evolving the iSWA system, and we hope that it will benefit not only NASA satellite operators, but also that it may also help space-weather forecasting at other agencies such as the Air Force Weather Agency and NOAA,\u201d says Michael Hesse, chief of the Space Weather Laboratory at NASA Goddard.\nSpace-weather information tends to be scattered over various Web sites. NASA Goddard space physicist Antti Pulkkinen says the iSWA system represents \u201cthe most comprehensive single interface for general space-weather-related information,\u201d providing data on past and current space-weather events. The system allows the user to configure or design custom displays of the information.\nThe system compiles data about conditions on the sun, in Earth\u2019s magnetosphere \u2014 the protective magnetic field that envelops our planet \u2014 and down to Earth\u2019s surface. It provides a user interface to provide NASA\u2019s satellite operators and with a real-time view of space weather. In addition to NASA, the iSWA system is used by the Air Force Weather agency.\nAccess to space-weather information that combines data from state-of-the-art space-weather models with concurrent observations of the space environment provides a powerful tool for users to obtain a personalized \u201cquick look\u201d at space-weather information, detailed insight into space-weather conditions, as well as tools for historical analysis of the space-weather\u2019s impact.\nDevelopment of the iSWA system has been a joint activity between the Office of the Chief Engineer at NASA Headquarters and the Applied Engineering and Technology Directorate and the Science and Exploration Directorate at NASA Goddard. The iSWA system is located at NASA Goddard.\nThe Community Coordinated Modeling Center is funded by the Heliophysics Division in the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters, and the National Science Foundation.\nLayout selector tool:","id":"<urn:uuid:ee290d5b-d6ca-45b4-9106-2c14f262df50>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/wattsupwiththat.com\/2010\/02\/24\/new-all-in-one-space-weather-tool-from-nasa\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.8825551271,"token_count":837,"score":2.640625,"int_score":3}
{"text":"From Uncyclopedia, the content-free encyclopedia\nHeliocentrism is a theory which has become an established dogma in 21st century privately-funded science, despite having been abandoned in the 20th century, according to Conservapedia. Heliocentrism is the concept that a giant magnet is located in the center of the Earth, and the planets and the universe revolve around it, attracted by the magnetic energy. Heliocentrism is criticized for ignoring the everyday observations of mountain climbers and airplane travellers.\nIt has been characterized by Sarah Palin as \"a lie perpetrated by scientists to diminish the glory of America\" and pushed onto the good, God-fearing people by ignorant pagan-types suffering from Gross Moral Turpitude.\nedit Proponents of Heliocentrism\nThe most ardent supporters of heliocentrism are found in US academia, despite or perhaps because of how the theory is being used to diminish the central role of the USA and its establishment at the center of the universe. Among those scientists that support it, the overwhelming majority also support the theories of evolution, climate change, nuclear fusion, ley line energy production, spacial time distortion, and extra-dimensional astral travel as well as using more tax dollars to fund their own research. Notable believers in heliocentrism include Charles Darwin, Lenin, Al Gore and Ellen DeGeneres.\nedit Evidence of Heliocentrism\nHeliocentrism is widely considered as being in accordance with the teaching of the holy book, which is commonly accepted as scientific evidence.

{"text":"2 Products Found\n|Results per page: 24 48 72||\nIn terms of ecologically friendly flooring, bamboo is one of the top contenders. Not only is bamboo flooring made from totally renewable resources, but it also is available in a wide variety of design options. For those who desire the look of hardwood flooring but are concerned about the environmental consequences of harvesting trees, bamboo offers the perfect solution. While bamboo is not technically wood flooring, its appearance is close enough to fool even the most discerning eye.\nWhy is Bamboo Flooring Considered Environmentally Friendly?\nAlthough bamboo is actually a type of grass, it is harder than red oak. It reaches full maturity in just 3 to 5 years rather than several decades and re-growth appears naturally without the need for replanting. Harvesting bamboo is actually somewhat required because it is so hardy that leaving it to its own devices would put a strain on the environment. It would be a terrible shame to waste the harvested material, so people have designed many ways to put it to good use from thatched roofs to flooring material.\nBamboo also has no requirements for irrigation, fertilizers, or pesticides when grown in its natural environment. Bamboo is naturally resistant to insects and pests. The lack of need for harsh chemicals during its growth only does more to keep the carbon footprint down.\nHow is Bamboo Flooring Manufactured?\nThere are several steps involved in creating a material suitable for flooring from bamboo. Upon harvest, the bamboo is boiled to remove its natural starches and moisture which could become a wonderful environment for termites if not remedied. The outer skin is then removed and the stalk is cut into strips for flooring. These strips are then boiled again to make them even harder or carbonized; the longer the carbonation process, the darker the color of the final product.\nWhen the strips are ready they are formed into flooring either by gluing strips together or gluing a single layer of bamboo strips on top of another solid surface, resulting in either solid bamboo flooring or engineered bamboo flooring respectively. The flooring also goes through other processes to strengthen it further by applying laminate materials to increase scratch resistance.\nWhat are the design options with bamboo flooring?\n- Bamboo flooring is available in widths ranging from 3 \u017e inches to 7 inches and thicknesses of 5\/8 inches and 9\/16 inches.\n- Finish options for bamboo flooring are available from unfinished and natural from the FSC Unfinished Bamboo collection to nearly black and a choice of either horizontal or vertical graining as found in the FSC Designer collection.\n- The two edge types of bamboo flooring are micro-beveled edges and square edges. Bamboo is also available in floating floor styles and nail or glue down styles.\nHow Durable is Bamboo Flooring?\nBamboo is naturally hard and durable, and the process it goes through during the manufacture of flooring only increases this strength. While one should avoid sliding furniture across the floor or allowing water to stand, bamboo flooring will do well in most any low moisture room. Bamboo flooring from the EcoBamboo Collection to the FSC Prestige Collection will be an investment in beauty and durability that is sure to add value to any home with minimal environmental impact.","id":"<urn:uuid:d0d737e4-1962-4d64-87de-fe82bc79661a>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.contempofloorcoverings.com\/floors\/bamboo-flooring.html?bamboo_usage=Light+Commercial&bamboo_width=7+inch","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.949857235,"token_count":681,"score":2.78125,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Teach your child the importance of good sportsmanship.Not too long ago, my 10-year-old daughter's indoor soccer team finished their game and lined up to do the traditional end-of-game walk with the other team. If your own child has ever played in a team sport, you likely have seen this walk a hundred times before. Win or lose, each member of the team is expected to essentially tell the other players they did well and good game. This is a classic way to end a game on a positive note and to exhibit good sportsmanship, win or lose.\nThe opposing team in this case, however, had a unique way of showing their good sportsmanship. They all licked their hands before holding them out for our own girls to \"low-five\" as they walked down the line. Our girls saw this, and they refused to touch the other girls' slimy, slobbery, germ-ridden hands. You may be wondering if our girls' team beat this other team. The truth is that they beat the other team pretty harshly, but there is no score that would justify the level of poor sportsmanship that the other team exhibited.\nAs a parent, I can only hope the parents or coach on the other team reprimanded their girls for this unsportsmanlike behavior. This is not the kind of behavior any parent would be proud to see in their own child. However, this is just one of many ways unsportsmanlike behavior is exhibited. From tears on the field to pushing, shoving, \"trash talking\" and more, there are many different behaviors that are associated with poor sportsmanship.\nThe fact is that good sportsmanship is a quality that can play a role in your child's ability to react to other situations throughout life. Competition may occur on the field, but it also plays a part in the college admission process, a run for a place on the school board, the job application process and so much more. Teaching your child how to be a good sport now can help him or her to handle wins and losses throughout life with grace. So how can you help your child build a healthy \"win-or-lose\" attitude?\nA Positive Parental Role Model\nNo parent takes pride in seeing other players, either from their child's own team or on the opposing team, be better than their own child. Parents simply want their child to be the best. However, somewhere between the desire to see your kid to aim for the stars and the truth of reality is the fact that there always will be someone or some team that is better. As a parent, you can talk negatively about these better players or better teams, or you can talk positively about them. You can use these interactions with better competition to point out areas where your own child can improve and to teach your child to respect those with skills and talents that are worthy of respect. This is a great opportunity to teach your child to turn lemons into lemonade.\nYou Win Some, You Lose Some\nVery few children really are the best at what they do. There is always someone who either is better now or who is working hard to be better in the near future. A team that was on top this season may not be the top team the next season. While you want your child to work hard and strive to win, it is unrealistic to expect a child or his or her team to win all of the time. Children will inevitably be disappointed after a loss. This is understandable and justified, especially if he or she has been working hard and did his or her personal best. As a parent, your response to a loss is every bit as important as your response to a win. The fact is that an entire team can play their best, and they may simply be out-matched. Teaching kids that losses do happen, even when they try their hardest, can help them to cope with their defeat. Show them that you are proud of their performance and effort at each game rather than letting the tally mark under the \"W\" column dictate this.\nA Lesson Learned\nThe fact is that a child or a team simply will not improve very quickly when they are blowing out the competition on a regular basis. To be the best, you have to play the best. You have to be challenged by the best, and sometimes this means a loss will occur. Within each game, whether a win or loss, lies an opportunity for growth, development and improvement. After each game, regardless of the outcome, talk to your child about what he or she did well and what he or she thinks could have been done better. Rather than tell your child what you think, ask your child his or her personal opinion on the matter and what the coach said. Then, remind your child that these are areas that he or she can work on for the next game.\nNobody likes to lose, but challenge and loss are the motivators that make us all better. Whether on the field, in the workplace or any number of other environments, challenge and loss are vital to developing that ever-important trait that true winners in life have. That trait is perseverance.Content by Kim Daugherty .","id":"<urn:uuid:efad95cf-5021-4697-ab61-7e73bd8414e7>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/shine.yahoo.com\/team-mom\/building-healthy-win-lose-attitude-161700902.html?.tsrc=attcf","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9801746011,"token_count":1056,"score":2.75,"int_score":3}
{"text":"There are many aspects to learning the creation of interactive fiction. Here we mostly undertake to explain approaches to using Inform, and leave the larger questions of craft and design for elsewhere.\nThe two manuals\nThere are two interlinked manuals built into every copy of the Inform application: if you've downloaded Inform, you already have them. But they are also available to read or download separately from this website.\nWriting with Inform is an overview of the language, beginning with the simplest kinds of construction (such as building a map of rooms, objects, and doors) and working its way up to more advanced tasks. It is meant to be read more or less sequentially, since later chapters build on the ideas in earlier ones; though some of the late chapters (such as those covering numbers, activities, or advanced text) might reasonably be read out of order.\nThe Recipe Book approaches the problem of authorship from a different perspective. Instead of trying to teach the language from start to finish, it is organized for the author who wants to accomplish something specific, such as asking the player's name at the start of play or implementing a system of measured liquids. It shares the same set of examples that are keyed to Writing with Inform, but organizes them into a new order and accompanies them with text about design problems in creating interactive fiction, rather than explanation of language features.\nFollowing requests from partially sighted Inform users, we've also made two plain vanilla versions of the manual available - they have as little decoration or web design as possible, which means less clutter for screen-reading software to cope with. We offer a choice of:\nMinimally tagged HTML provides an archive containing the pages of the manuals and examples as vanilla-flavoured HTML files.\nWriting with Inform in plain text format is just what it claims to be - one single file containing only text, with no marking-up of any kind. This contains all of the examples, following the text in numerical order, but not the Recipe Book. (The whole idea of two interleaved manuals can't really be achieved in one flat text file.)\nWe receive occasional questions about publishing a printed form of the manuals. The answer is that we intend to do exactly that, in due course, but that we expect the current text will be revised wholesale once the system is more mature. (The same thing happened with Inform 6, with the appearance of the printed Designer's Manual in 2001 essentially marking the end of its design cycle.)","id":"<urn:uuid:c705459a-3198-4027-997b-597db9ccd8f1>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/inform7.com\/learn\/manuals\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9500200152,"token_count":504,"score":3.0,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Deciphering the function and regulation of AUTS2\nUniversity of California, San Francisco\nAutism is a neurodevelopmental disorder with complex genetic and environmental causes. Many gene mutations have been associated with autism; however, they explain only a small part of the genetic cause for this disorder. 98% of our genome does not encode for protein and is thus termed noncoding. In this noncoding space are gene regulatory sequences that tell genes when, where and at what amount to turn on or off. Mutations in these gene regulatory elements could thus be an important cause of autism. Despite the potential importance of these noncoding gene regulatory regions in autism susceptibility, very few studies have been performed trying to implicate them in this disorder. This pilot study focuses on a strong autism candidate gene, the autism susceptibility candidate 2 (AUTS2) gene. Mutations in its regulatory elements have been associated with autism and its function is not well known. Using both zebrafish and mice as the model organisms, the project aims to identify noncoding gene regulatory sequences of AUTS2. The fellow will then look to see if any individuals with autism have mutations in the regulatory regions identified. They will also reduce the expression of this gene in zebrafish and look for abnormalities to further clarify its function. This study promises to further our understanding of how differences in the noncoding region of the genome can lead to autism. It also aims to advance our understanding of a gene of unknown function that has been implicated in autism.","id":"<urn:uuid:b119f23a-e8b4-478b-8b57-2472864187b9>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.autismspeaks.org\/genetics\/grants\/deciphering-function-and-regulation-auts2","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9440978765,"token_count":307,"score":2.53125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Last Updated: Feb 17, 2012\nFair trade is a sales model that honors each participant in the production and purchase process. It focuses on sustainability and protection of the environment, and is rooted in fair economic practices and interpersonal connections. When you purchase an item labeled as fair trade, you are helping support fair prices, environmental protections, direct trade, fair labor conditions, and local communities.\nWhy Buy Fair Trade\nOur modern world economy puts a heavy focus on the bottom line: in the decision between two similar products, price is usually the deciding factor. However, this practice often discriminates against small farmers, craftsmen, and labor cooperatives, since their per-unit production and materials costs are higher than those of mass producers. Additionally, major manufacturers may employ unjust business practices, such as low wages or poor worker rights, to maintain low prices for their finished products.\nFair trade, on the other hand, honors the developing world's small businesses and promotes equal rights for workers and producers around the world. Additionally, this business model supports social development, helping fund schools and community growth, and directly benefits some of the world's poorest communities.\nFair Price & Fair Labor\nThe international Fair Trade Labeling Organization sets the price for all Fair Trade Certified\u2122 products, ensuring that each item is priced justly. By these standards, a fair price adequately covers the cost the production and living wages for workers. A living wage is defined as sufficient to cover medical care, education, food, shelter and cost of living.\nFair trade companies, farmers and artisans respect their environment and engage in sustainable production. For example, fair trade farmers avoid the use of most agrochemicals by employing natural methods like crop rotation and biological pest control. Almost 85% of Fair Trade Certified\u2122 coffee is produced organically.\nThe conventional supply chain employs many intermediaries \u2013 buyers, exporters, and importers, among others. Fair trade supports a more direct route, connecting a producer or cooperative to a fair trade distributor, then to the store. This process allows for less profit dilution, and fosters long-term relationships between producers and importers.\nSupport Local Communities\nWithout fair trade, artisans, farmers and cooperatives from small, developing communities would not have access to the global market. By purchasing fair trade items produced by these workers, you contribute directly to their local economy. In fact, many fair trade producers invest profits back into their businesses and communities. Additionally, all fair trade sales include a \"social premium,\" which is a set fee paid to the cooperative that must be invested in community development. Each cooperative makes a collective decision as to how to invest their social premium.","id":"<urn:uuid:1ae78faf-b83b-4730-af4a-f48608d90368>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/costarica.com\/green\/fair-trade\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9574245811,"token_count":540,"score":3.25,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Warmer temperatures, variable monsoons, and other signs of climate change are a hot topic of conversation among many Himalayan villagers, according to scientific sampling of climate change perception among local peoples.\n\u201cThis area is cold and it\u2019s often raining. Even during the non-monsoon times there is mist and fog so inevitably conversations here turn to weather,\u201d said Kamal Bawa, biologist at the University of Massachusetts, Boston (UMB), and president of Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE) in Bangalore, India. \u201cWhen you stop and have a cup of tea in someone\u2019s kitchen, the conversation invariably turns to the weather. But then they soon start talking about how the weather has been changing.\u201d\nBawa is also a member of the National Geographic Committee for Research and Exploration.\nBawa didn\u2019t set out to study Himalayan perceptions of climate change. But after hearing the same themes repeated again and again during household conversations he decided to investigate. With UMB graduate student Pahupati Chaudhary, he surveyed some 500 homes spread across 18 villages in Darjeeling Hills, West Bengal, India and Nepal\u2019s Ilam district. The pair found some surprisingly consistent observations.\nThree-fourths of the people surveyed believe that their weather is getting warmer and two-thirds believe that summer and monsoon season have begun earlier over the past ten years. Seventy percent believe that water sources are drying up while forty-six percent said that they think there is less snow on the high mountains.\nMany villagers also told Chaudhary they\u2019d noticed shifts in some species ranges and earlier flowering and budding of plants. New pests have also arrived, villagers routinely reported, to plague crops and people\u2014including mosquitoes where none had been before.\nMost of these changes were reported by much higher percentages of people living at higher altitudes than by those at lower altitudes. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown in earlier research that people at high altitudes seem to be more sensitive to climate change, and of course it\u2019s known that climate change is more severe at higher altitudes, so that\u2019s not a surprise,\u201d Bawa said.\nMany Himalayan peoples live in areas where predicted and observed impacts of climate change, like species migration, are more acute. Many of them also live \u201cclose to the land,\u201d where agricultural-based livelihoods make them especially attuned to weather patterns.\nListening to Locals Can Help Climate Science\nScientific data on climate change have been hard to come by in the region, Bawa reported. Few weather stations dot remote and high-altitude locales and where they do exist their data are often incomplete.\nBut where data can be found they seem to corroborate local observations, Bawa said, citing his own research on temperature and rainfall records as well as the work of other scientists listed in recent Biology Letters and Current Science reports of Bawa and Chaudhary\u2019s research.\n\u201cGovernments in the region are now gearing up towards more research,\u201d Bawa said. \u201cBut it will take time to gather this climate data.\u201d That\u2019s why local knowledge can be such valuable human intelligence, he added. It can be gathered quickly and widely and used to \u201cjump start\u201d scientific efforts.\n\u201cThere seems to be quite a bit of knowledge residing with local communities, in the Himalaya and elsewhere, and we can really use that knowledge to formulate scientific questions for further research and make more rapid assessments of the impacts of climate change.\u201d\nBawa said it\u2019s hard to determine to what extent local peoples are familiar with the global dialogue on climate change, or how much that might have influenced their perceptions. But most of those he spoke with didn\u2019t identify a clear cause for the changes they\u2019d observed.\n\u201cWe\u2019re saying that people seem to be aware that the climate is changing, but they may not necessarily be aware of why it\u2019s changing. I think when you come to that question people don\u2019t have any ideas\u2014or they may have some very different ideas.\u201d\nBawa pointed to a recent study of this topic in Tibet, where many respondents believed that humans are causing climate change\u2014but not by producing greenhouse gasses as most climate scientists believe. \u201cThey seem to think that the climate is changing because the Gods are not happy and perhaps the people in the younger generations are not praying enough.\u201d\nThis research was supported in part by a Committee for Research and Exploration grant of the National Geographical Society.","id":"<urn:uuid:666a34c3-a3b0-48d9-822b-04ba99c0d218>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/newswatch.nationalgeographic.com\/2011\/09\/09\/changing-climate-a-hot-topic-among-himalayan-villagers-study-finds\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9610677958,"token_count":968,"score":3.15625,"int_score":3}
{"text":"The Garo community is one of the major tribes in Bangladesh. According to the history books, the Garo tribe entered Bangladesh in the first century. They were refugees from Mongolia and came to this region through Tibet.\nThe Garo have stayed in Bangladesh for thousands of years. Initially, they followed a religion called Sonatoni; during the British rule in this subcontinent they came to Christ. Today, nearly 100 percent of the Garo tribe practices Christianity, though a few still believe in Sonatoni.\nGaros have their own language, Achick, which is completely different from the local language, Bengali. Achik has several accents\/branches such as Habeng, Attong, etc.\nThe Garo tribe also has its own culture. Their dress, food habits and celebration styles can be easily distinguished from the Bengalis and other tribes.\nThe people from the Garo tribe have different features than the original inhabitants of Bangladesh (Bengali people). They are a little shorter and have fair skin. Their eyes and nose are similar to their ancestors from Mongolia.\nCompared to the other tribal groups, the Garo tribe is little advanced in education and social activities. The first Garo church (Garo Baptist Convention) was established in 1910. Many missionaries and evangelists from Europe and North America worked among the Garo people over the decades.\nBeing a part of a developing country, the Garo community also suffers from poverty. Many Garo families are deprived of education.\nGaros in the villages and in remote places suffer from lack of clean water and sanitation. There are many villages like Gobindopur and Nalchapra, which greatly need hospitals and medical facilities.\nThe people from the Garo community have to go to the local pharmacy for minor diseases or injuries. For major problems, they have to take the patient to the town, which is about 35 kilometers away.\nThe Garo have only one high school (sixth through 10th grade) with a capacity of only 300 children. This government school has only nine teachers. There are also two primary schools in those villages with limited capacity and facilities.\nThe houses of the Garo people are made of bamboo walls and straw or tin roofs. Some houses have mud walls with a roof of straw and plastic sheets. House are typically 7 feet wide and 14 feet long. The Garo build their own houses. Usually they have free spaces in front of their houses. They keep cows, chicken and ducks as pets.\nGaro families usually have an average of two to three children.\nThirty percent of the Garo people have completed high school. However, the remaining 70 percent have not; the poor families can\u2019t afford to send their children to school.\nThe government of Bangladesh has ensured that all children can attend primary school. But many children from the Garo community drop out after the primary level.\nThe educated people from the Garo community work in nongovernmental and other corporate organizations. The poorer Garo people earn their keep by working as day laborers, usually in the crop fields for nine or 10 hours daily.\nAvailable transportation in Garo villages is cycle or rickshaw, especially for long distances. But since most peope can\u2019t afford the rickshaw fare, they walk. Cycle-vans are used to carry goods.\nIn the Garo culture, both male and female have to work for the family. The interesting part is that the Garo ladies get ownership of the properties from the family, a tradition completely opposite of the Bengali people.\nThe Garo festivals are very colorful and full of music and dancing. Christmas and Easter are the two major religious festivals. Their biggest cultural festival is called Wangala.\nWangala is the festival when the Garo thank God for the new crops. It takes place just after the harvesting period. The Garo prepare pitha (homemade pies), sweets and other food to celebrate this occasion. At the celebration, Garo girls wear their traditional dress and sprinkle puffed rice and dry rice with their hands.\nThe traditional dress of the Garo ladies is called Dokbanda, a combination of a long skirt and blouse. The gents wear regular shirts, trousers and lungi (Bangladeshi skirt for men).\nThe favorite dishes of the Garo are pork, snails, eel and little tortoises. They use a special substance called Khari to make the food more tasteful. They prepare the Khari at home.\nCompassion-assisted child development centers that serve the Garo people include: BD-401, 402, 403, 404, 405, 406, 407, 408, 409, 410, 411 and 412.","id":"<urn:uuid:02c36598-170a-4b4c-9fda-430264fc914b>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/blog.compassion.com\/serving-the-garo-tribe-in-bangladesh\/quote-comment-29460\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9727146626,"token_count":971,"score":3.140625,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Why can some people drink heavily and never become alcoholics when other people get addicted so quickly?\nContributing Factors to the Development of Alcoholism\nWhy some people can use and even abuse alcohol without ever developing alcoholism, and why some people seem unusually susceptible to alcoholism, remains a poorly understood phenomenon.\nThere is a genetic component to alcoholism, and people who grow up in alcoholic homes are far more likely to become alcoholics themselves. Children born to alcoholic parents, but raised in homes without alcohol abuse or addiction are also predisposed to alcoholism, so we do know that genetics plays an important role. But all people genetically predisposed to alcoholism do not develop dependencies, and some people with no genetic history of alcoholism end up battling the disease for years. It is now accepted that although a genetic predisposition plays an important influence in the development of the disease, that social and environmental factors are in fact the lager influences towards alcohol abuse or alcoholism.\nIn addition to genetic influences, the Mayo Clinic considers that there are three additional primary influences to alcohol abuse or alcoholism.\nEmotional States or Emotional Stressors can Induce Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism\nPeople may use alcohol excessively in response to frequent or significant emotional disturbances or stresses. When alcohol is used with enough frequency as an emotional management or stress coping tool the risk of dependency or alcoholism increases greatly. There is also likely a bio physical link with stress and alcohol abuse, and stress hormones have been casually linked to increased alcohol consumption and a greater risk for alcoholism.\nPeople who use alcohol to deal with life's problems or stresses are at a greater risk to develop alcoholism.\nThe Co-Presence of a Corresponding Psychiatric Condition\nPeople suffering through psychiatric conditions like depression, bi polar disorder, borderline personality disorder or anxiety disorders are at a greatly elevated risk to develop alcohol abuse problems or alcoholism. Psychiatric patients often use alcohol or other illicit drugs to self medicate the negative symptoms of an experienced disorder. Unfortunately, while intoxication may bring some temporary relief, the long term effects of alcohol abuse almost always worsen experienced psychiatric symptoms. Alcoholic psychiatric patients are at a great risk for an accelerated progression of both diseases, and require immediate interventions and treatment.\nIn addition to clinical psychiatric conditions, non clinical, but still significant factors such as low self esteem can also increase the likelihood to alcohol abuse, and ultimately alcoholism. Alcohol is rarely an effective long term coping strategy.\nSocial Environmental Factors\nAs a society, largely due to billions of dollars invested in alcohol advertising campaigns, there is a perception of alcohol being associated with glamour, attractiveness and success, and these lingering subconscious perceptions may influence people to try alcohol at a young age and continue to drink more than they should throughout life.\nThe immediate environment can also increase the probability of alcoholism. People who socialize, or live romantically with a person who drinks to excess, whether dependent or not, are far more likely to also drink heavily, and put themselves at risk for alcohol abuse and alcoholism.\nEven the neighborhood around the home seems to influence consumption patterns, and people brought up in or who reside in neighborhoods of heavy abuse are also more likely to use and abuse alcohol themselves.\nNothing about alcoholism is completely understood, and all we know is that the variables that can induce alcohol abuse and ultimately alcoholism are many, and that what may cause alcohol dependence in one, seem to have little influence over another. We all present with an individual risk profile for our susceptibility to the disease, although those people with a genetic history of alcoholism are undoubtedly at an increased risk to develop the disease.\nRegardless of the factors that may induce the occurrence of the disease, the treatments are essentially the same, and alcoholics need intervention, intensive treatment, and long term aftercare therapies. Most alcoholics will never be capable of drinking in moderation, and abstinence is the only recommended philosophy of use for people with alcoholic histories.\nPage last updated Sep 23, 2012","id":"<urn:uuid:97c75d00-1e85-4576-b5f7-0d79552f0dbf>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.choosehelp.com\/alcoholism\/alcoholism-why-some-become-drunks-and-others-dont\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9493965507,"token_count":790,"score":3.28125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"New study challenges previous findings that humans are an altruistic anomaly, and positions chimpanzees as cooperative, especially when their partners are patient.\nResearchers at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center, have shown chimpanzees have a significant bias for prosocial behavior. This, the study authors report, is in contrast to previous studies that positioned chimpanzees as reluctant altruists and led to the widely held belief that human altruism evolved in the last six million years only after humans split from apes. The current study findings are available in the online edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nAccording to Yerkes researchers Victoria Horner, PhD, Frans de Waal, PhD, and their colleagues, chimpanzees may not have shown prosocial behaviors in other studies because of design issues, such as the complexity of the apparatus used to deliver rewards and the distance between the animals.\n\u201cI have always been skeptical of the previous negative findings and their over-interpretation, says Dr. de Waal. \u201cThis study confirms the prosocial nature of chimpanzees with a different test, better adapted to the species,\u201d he continues.","id":"<urn:uuid:5d537746-8ad2-44d6-8586-ae6a035cf9b2>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/myanthroblog.tumblr.com\/tagged\/science","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.921982944,"token_count":228,"score":3.09375,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Born in 1940, Wangari Maathai is a Kenyan ecologist and environmental activist who founded the Green Belt Movement in 1977, causing the media to depict her as a latter-day Johnny Appleseed who has planted millions of trees in Africa. (The Green Belt Movement has been responsible for the planting of more than 10 million trees to prevent soil erosion and provide a source of firewood.)\nAs a member of the Green Belt Movement, Maathai has led sub-Saharan African women in provoking sometimes-violent clashes with police. Though casting herself as a hero of the downtrodden, she has demonstrated against peasants\u2019 economic interests. When Kenyan autocratic leader Daniel arap Moi wanted to revive the nation\u2019s dead economy by building the world\u2019s largest skyscraper in the capital, her riotous actions dried up investment. Later, she led a protest to prevent \u201csmall-scale farming\u201d on African forestland and called farmers \u201cinvaders\u201d who were guilty of \u201crape.\u201d In 1992, she and the women in her Green Belt Movement foreshadowed contemporary Western antiwar demonstrators by staging a public strip-in.\nIn 2004 she won the Nobel Peace Prize for her work in \u201chuman rights\u201d and \u201creversing deforestation across Africa.\u201d\nWhen Maathai was awarded her Nobel Prize, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan paid her a glowing tribute:\nMaathai is also an anti-white, anti-Western crusader for international socialism. She charges that \u201csome sadistic [white] scientists\u201d created the AIDS virus \u201cto punish blacks\u201d and, ultimately, \u201cto wipe out the black race.\u201d Maathai continues:\n\u201cRenowned and admired throughout her native Kenya and across Africa for her pioneering struggle against deforestation and for women\u2019s rights and democracy, Ms. Maathai has also played an important role at UN conferences such as the Earth Summit, making an imprint on the global quest for sustainable development.... Selfless and steadfast, Ms. Maathai has been a champion of the environment, of women, of Africa, and of anyone concerned about our future security.\u201d\n\u201cSome say that AIDS came from the monkeys, and I doubt that, because we have been living with monkeys [since] time immemorial; others say it was a curse from God, but I say it cannot be that.... Us black people are dying more than any other people in this planet. It\u2019s true that there are some people who create agents to wipe out other people.\u201d\n\u201cWhy is the rest of the world just watching,\u201d Maathai asks, \u201cdoing nothing while Africans are being wiped out? The rest of the world has abandoned us.\u201d\nThere is, of course, a very real genocide throughout sub-Saharan Africa, as Muslim Arabs murder indigenous black Christians and animists, 100,000 in Darfur alone. The repeated rape of young black boys by Arabs is now commonplace. These scenes first played out during the genocide in Rwanda, which began early in the Clinton administration, and have been seen all over the sub-continent for a decade. Maathai addressed this brutality at the World Women\u2019s Conference in Beijing in 1995, where she blamed it on Western capitalists. She claims that Western governments laid the groundwork for present slaughter during the Cold War. \u201cThe carnage goes on in Somalia, Rwanda, Liberia and in the streets of many cities,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople of Africa continue to be sacrificed so that some factories may stay open, earn capital and save jobs.\u201d\nThus in Maathai\u2019s view, Arab genocide is the fault of wealthy whites.\nMaathai has courted global socialism through her long association with the United Nations\u2019 environmentalist agenda. She was a member of the Commission on Global Governance (CGG), founded in 1992 at the suggestion of former West German Chancellor and socialist Willy Brandt. Maathai worked on the CGG alongside Maurice Strong, Jimmy Carter, and Robert McNamara. The group\u2019s manifesto, \u201cOur Global Neighborhood,\u201d calls for a dramatic reordering of the world\u2019s political power \u2013 and redistribution of the world\u2019s wealth.\nMost importantly, the CGG\u2019s proposals would phase out America\u2019s veto in the Security Council. At the same time, the CGG would increase UN authority over member nations, declaring, \u201cAll member-states of the UN that have not already done so should accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the World Court.\u201d It asks the UN to prevail upon member governments to enact proposals made by wide NGOs \u2013 such as the Green Belt Movement. \u201cOur Global Neighborhood\u201d also suggested creating a 10,000-man \u201cUN Volunteer Force\u201d to be deployed at the UN\u2019s approval on infinite peacekeeping missions everywhere (except Iraq).\nMaathai currently acts as a commissioner for the Earth Charter, along with the aforementioned Maurice Strong, Mikhail Gorbachev and Steven Rockefeller. She is also on the Earth Charter\u2019s Steering Committee. In addition to calling for sharing the \u201cbenefits of development . . . equitably,\u201d the Earth Charter calls on international bodies to \u201cPromote the equitable distribution of wealth within nations and among nations.\u201d Another Charter provision would disarm the entire world and use the money previously allocated for national defense to restore the environment. Additionally, the Earth Charter worries about the \u201cunprecedented rise in human population,\u201d and demands \u201cuniversal access to health care.\u201d\nMaathai earned her biology degree from Mount St. Scholastica College in Kansas and a Master\u2019s degree at the University of Pittsburgh. She later returned to Kenya and worked in veterinary medical research at the University of Nairobi, eventually earning a Ph.D. there and becoming head of the veterinary medicine faculty.","id":"<urn:uuid:fae983e5-45da-44d4-86c0-5ccc7cb210d8>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/discoverthenetworks.com\/printindividualProfile.asp?indid=2007","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9558945298,"token_count":1242,"score":2.84375,"int_score":3}

{"text":"(BPT) - Everyone, including moms and doctors, can agree that a good night of sleep is necessary for good health, high energy, and an individual\u2019s overall well-being. Not getting enough good sleep \u2013 or rapid eye movement sleep \u2013 can affect the mind and body\u2019s ability to react appropriately to outside factors, the National Sleep Foundation reports.\nCreating the perfect sleep environment is the first step toward ensuring a good night of sleep. March, the first month of spring, is also National Sleep Awareness Month, and it aims to remind everyone why a good night of zzz\u2019s is so important. One in four adults in the United States experience occasional sleepiness, difficulty falling asleep, or waking up feeling un-refreshed at least a few times per week, according to the National Sleep Foundation.\nFortunately, you can implement these tips this spring, and create a comfortable sleeping environment in your home for both you and your family.\n* Eliminate distractions \u2013 Electronics. Noises. Lights. Many items, such as laptops, TVs and cellphones, commonly found in bedrooms can cause distractions and prevent a person from entering REM sleep. Remove these items from the room. Also, consider running a fan or white noise machine to create a soft sound barrier, which will help muffle unexpected sounds like a person flushing the toilet or an engine rumbling loudly on the street outside.\n* Establish comfort \u2013 Creating a sleep-conducive environment is an important factor in making the most out of every minute you sleep. Cuddle up each night with soft linens and create a calming atmosphere in the bedroom. To do this, try adding Downy Infusions Lavender Serenity liquid fabric softener when washing your sheets and sleepwear this season, to make your linens and sleepwear silky, soft and soothing. It will help lull you right into bed. With Downy you can wake up to a great scent and start the day off on the right side of the bed.\n* Be routine \u2013 The human body reacts favorably to familiar and repeated movements. So consider following a routine every night, whether it\u2019s taking a warm bath, reading a chapter in a book or journaling. The National Sleep Foundation advises against watching TV or using electronics as part of this routine because electronics can hinder quality sleep.\n* Stay active \u2013 Sleep is needed to give the body energy to get through its daily activities. Conversely, daily activities are needed to tire the body out for a good night of sleep. Consider adding physical activities into your daily schedule so you can settle into bed between the covers each night, tired and ready for a good night of sleep.\nNobody enjoys walking around in a mental fog or having no energy during the day, so be sure to create the perfect sleep environment in your home for you and your family this spring. It will help you get the most out of every minute of your zzz\u2019s.","id":"<urn:uuid:83500816-72c7-4a5a-8edd-7e72cbd48886>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.bensoncountynews.com\/21745\/1979\/onlinefeature\/17716\/creating-the-perfect-sleep-environment-this-spring","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9243288636,"token_count":601,"score":2.609375,"int_score":3}
{"text":"SAN ANGELO, Texas \u2014 MOSCOW (AP) The head of Russia's space agency said Tuesday that cosmic radiation was the most likely cause of the failure of a Mars moon probe that crashed to Earth this month, and suggested that a low-quality imported component may have been vulnerable to the radiation. Vladimir Popovkin also said a manned launch to the International Space Station is being postponed from March 30 because of faults found in the Soyuz capsule.\nThe statements underline an array of trouble that has afflicted the country's vaunted space program in recent months, including the August crash of a supply ship for the space station and last month's crash of a communications satellite.\nSince the end of the U.S. space shuttle program last year, Russian craft are the only means to send crew to and from the ISS.\nThe unmanned Phobos-Ground probe was to have gone to the Mars moon of Phobos, taken soil samples and brought them back. But it became stuck in Earth orbit soon after its launch on Nov. 9. It fell out of orbit on Jan. 15, reportedly off the coast of Chile, but no fragments have been found.\nThe failure was a severe embarrassment to Russia, and Popovkin initially suggested it could have been due to foreign sabotage.\nBut on Tuesday he said in televised remarks that an investigation showed the probable cause was \"localized influence of heavily radiated space particles.\"\nPopovkin, speaking in the city of Voronezh where the report was presented to Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, said two units of the Phobos-Ground probe's onboard computer system went into an energy-saving \"restart\" mode, apparently due to the radiation, while the craft was in its second orbital circuit.\nIt was not immediately clear why the units could not be brought out of that mode.\nPopovkin said that some microchips used on the craft were imported and possibly of inadequate quality to resist radiation. He did not specify where the chips were manufactured.\nYuri Koptev, a former space agency head who led the Phobos-Ground investigation, said 62 percent of the microchips used in the probe were \"industrial\" class, a less-sophisticated level than should be used in space flight.\nPopovkin said the craft's builder, Moscow-based NPO Lavochkin, should have taken into account the possibility of radiation interfering with the operation and said Lavochkin officials would face punishment for the oversight.\nPopovkin later announced that a March 30 planned launch of three astronauts to the space station will be postponed \"likely until the end of April\" because of problems with the capsule. He did not specify, but the state news agency RIA Novosti cited the director of Russia's cosmonaut-training program as saying leaks had been found in the capsule's seals.\nIt would be the second significant postponement of a manned Russian launch in the past year. The August crash of the supply ship pushed back a manned launch to the ISS because the booster rocket that failed in the crash was similar to the ones used in manned missions.","id":"<urn:uuid:fe10118b-a42c-4bff-bcb7-7ab62838ca60>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.gosanangelo.com\/news\/2012\/jan\/31\/1501lt-ap-eu-russia-falling-spacecraft0515-for\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9729071259,"token_count":640,"score":2.5625,"int_score":3}

{"text":"This year, millions of New Year\u2019s resolutions will be made \u2013 and then broken soon after. But there is one resolution that all men should keep: to maintain a healthy lifestyle.\nProstate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer in America, affecting one in six men, according to the Prostate Cancer Foundation. In addition, heart disease killed 26 percent of the men who died in 2006. And half of the men who die suddenly of coronary heart disease have no previous symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nThere are many simple ways men can reduce their risk for life-threatening health conditions. Make a New Year\u2019s resolution to improve your health and better your life with these easy tips.\nSometimes improving your health is as simple as a trip to the doctor. As you age, the likelihood of being diagnosed with prostate cancer increases significantly. Men over 40 should begin discussing their prostate health with a physician. Catching prostate cancer in its earliest stages can greatly improve a man\u2019s chance at survival, so it\u2019s important to be proactive and talk to your doctor about your prostate health. You can learn more about risk factors and prevention on the Prostate Cancer Foundation\u2019s website at www.PCF.org.\nChoosing healthy snacks and avoiding fatty meals can help reduce your risk of heart disease, diabetes and certain forms of cancer. Foods that are low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol and high in fiber can help prevent high cholesterol, according to the CDC. Additionally, several studies suggest that eating fish can help protect against prostate cancer because they have \u201cgood fat,\u201d particularly omega-3 fatty acids.\nMaintaining a healthy weight is crucial to preventing heart disease. Physical activity will help lower your blood pressure and cholesterol. According to the Surgeon General, adults should engage in moderately intense exercise for at least 30 minutes a day. By maintaining a healthy weight, you will also lower your risk for diabetes.\nDon\u2019t sweat the small stuff. Reducing your stress at work and at home can help improve your overall health and lead to a longer, happier life. Seek medical treatment for stress, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and depression. Treating these conditions may save your life and have been shown to improve survivorship in prostate cancer.\nThese are resolutions to keep.

Shmuel Grinberg, in contrast, agreed that She'arit Hapleta would soon be marking Liberation Day... but warned against losing the historical perspective of what was happening. Even though anti-Semitism had not disappeared and Jewish suffering had not ended, \"we neither have nor want to weaken the great historic truth, the great struggle against the monster of human oppression, for our spiritual and moral liberation\". Leo Schwarz, who took part in the meeting, explained: \"One of the main questions was, should the liberation be commemorated today as a day of mourning or a day of thanksgiving. There was little disagreement about the memory of the murdered martyrs... concerning celebrations of Liberation Day there were differences among groups within She'arit Hapleta, but the victors were those whose psychology had already been influenced by the positive dialectic of the future. Most members of the Central Committee supported the declaration of \"a memorial day combined with the liberation, which must express our grief and bitterness over the great tragedy of European Jewry, and simultaneously be a day of thanksgiving, which will be celebrated as a national symbol and will emphasize that the Jewish people still lives\". It was decided to observe the 14th of Adar as Liberation Day (15th May in 1946), as a memorial and victory day.\nFrom: Mankovitz, Ze'ev, Ideology and Politics Among She'arit Hapleta in the American Zone of Occupation in Germany 1945-1946, Ph.D. thesis, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1987, pp. 279-280 (Hebrew).\nSource: Yad Vashem","id":"<urn:uuid:bc0ae438-7cdc-4d63-bb5f-808a4dd2aaf4>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org\/jsource\/Holocaust\/libday.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9735329151,"token_count":385,"score":3.234375,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Father Christmas is the name used in many English-speaking countries outside the United States and Canada for a figure associated with Christmas. A similar figure with the same name (in other languages) exists in several other countries, including France (P\u00e8re No\u00ebl), Spain (Pap\u00e1 Noel, Padre Noel), Russia (Ded Moroz, Grandfather Frost), almost all Hispanic South America (Pap\u00e1 Noel), Brazil (Papai Noel), Portugal (Pai Natal), Italy (Babbo Natale), Armenia (Dzmer Papik), India (Christmas Father), Andorra (Pare Noel), Romania (Mo\u015f Cr\u0103ciun) and Turkey (Noel Baba).\nIn England the earliest known personification of Christmas does not describe him as old, or refer to him as 'father'. A carol attributed to Richard Smart, Rector of Plymtree from 1435 to 1477, takes the form of a sung dialogue between a choir and a figure representing Christmas, variously addressed as \u201cNowell\u201d, \u201cSir Christemas\u201d and \u201cmy lord Christemas\u201d. He does not distribute presents to children but is associated with adult celebrations. Giving news of Christ\u2019s birth, Christmas encourages everyone to eat and drink: \"Buvez bien par toute la campagnie,\/Make good cheer and be right merry.\" However, the specific depiction of Christmas as a merry old man emerged in the early 17th century. The rise of puritanism had led to increasing condemnation of the traditions handed down from pre-Reformation times, especially communal feasting and drinking. As debate intensified, those writing in support of the traditional celebrations often personified Christmas as a venerable, kindly old gentleman, given to good cheer but not excess. They referred to this personification as \"Christmas\", \"Old Christmas\" or \"Father Christmas\".\nBen Jonson in Christmas his Masque, dating from December 1616, notes the rising tendency to disparage the traditional forms of celebration. His character 'Christmas' therefore appears in outdated fashions, \"attir'd in round Hose, long Stockings, a close Doublet, a high crownd Hat with a Broach, a long thin beard, a Truncheon, little Ruffes, white shoes, his Scarffes, and Garters tyed crosse\", and announces \"Why Gentlemen, doe you know what you doe? ha! would you ha'kept me out? Christmas, old Christmas?\" Later, in a masque by Thomas Nabbes, The Springs Glorie produced in 1638, \"Christmas\" appears as \"an old reverend gentleman in furred gown and cap\".\nDuring the mid-17th century, the debate about the celebration of Christmas became politically charged, with Royalists adopting a pro-Christmas stance and radical puritans striving to ban the festival entirely. Early in 1646 an anonymous satirical author wrote The Arraignment, Conviction and Imprisoning of Christmas, in which a Royalist lady is frantically searching for Father Christmas: this was followed months later by the Royalist poet John Taylor's The Complaint of Christmas, in which Father Christmas mournfully visits puritan towns but sees \"...no sign or token of any Holy Day\". A book dating from the time of the Commonwealth, The Vindication of CHRISTMAS or, His Twelve Yeares' Observations upon the Times (London, 1652), involved \"Old Christmas\" advocating a merry, alcoholic Christmas and casting aspersions on the charitable motives of the ruling Puritans. In a similar vein, a humorous pamphlet of 1686 by Josiah King presents Father Christmas as the personification of festive traditions pre-dating the puritan commonwealth. He is described as an elderly gentleman of cheerful appearance, \"who when he came look't so smug and pleasant, his cherry cheeks appeared through his thin milk white locks, like (b)lushing Roses vail'd with snow white Tiffany\". His character is associated with feasting, hospitality and generosity to the poor rather than the giving of gifts.\nThis tradition continued into the following centuries, with \"Old Father Christmas\" being evoked in 1734 in the pamphlet Round About Our Coal Fire, as \"Shewing what Hospitality was in former Times, and how little of it there remains at present\", a rebuke to \"stingy\" gentry. A writer in \"Time's Telescope\" (1822) states that in Yorkshire at eight o'clock on Christmas Eve the bells greet \"Old Father Christmas\" with a merry peal, the children parade the streets with drums, trumpets, bells, (or in their absence, with the poker and shovel, taken from their humble cottage fire), the yule candle is lighted, and; \"High on the cheerful fire. Is blazing seen th' enormous Christmas brand.\" A letter to The Times in 1825, warning against poultry-dealers dishonestly selling off sub-standard geese at Christmas time, is jokingly signed \"Father Christmas\".\nIn these early references, Father Christmas, although invariably an old and cheerful man, is mainly associated with adult feasting and drinking rather than the giving of presents. Since the mid-Victorian era however, Father Christmas has gradually merged with the pre-modern gift-giver St Nicholas (Dutch Sinterklaas, hence Santa Claus) and associated folklore. Nowadays in Britain the figure is often called Santa Claus but also often referred to as Father Christmas: the two names are synonyms. In Europe, the figure is usually translated as Father Christmas (P\u00e8re No\u00ebl, Pap\u00e1 Noel, Padre Noel, etc.) rather than \"Santa Claus\" and is often said to reside in the mountains of Korvatunturi in Lapland Province, Finland.\nCurrent folklore \nFather Christmas often appears as a large man, often around seventy years old. He is dressed in a red suit trimmed with white fur, often girdled with a wide black belt, a matching hat, often long and floppy in nature, and dark boots. Often he carries a large brown sack filled with toys on his back (rarely, images of him have a beard but with no moustache). Urban myth has it that the red suit only appeared after the Coca Cola company started an advertising campaign depicting a red suited Father Christmas in the 1930s. However, the red suit was used long before, including by American illustrator Thomas Nast.\nFather Christmas comes down the chimney to put presents under the Christmas tree or in children's rooms, in their stockings. Some families leave a glass of sherry or mulled wine, mince pies, biscuits, or chocolate and a carrot for his reindeer near the stocking(s) as a present for him. In modern homes without chimneys he uses alternative means to enter the home. In some homes children write Christmas lists (of wished-for presents) and send them up the chimney or post them. He is often said to live at the North Pole.\nIn fiction \nFather Christmas appears in many English-language works of fiction, including J. R. R. Tolkien's Father Christmas Letters (written between 1920 and 1942, first published in 1976), the translation from the French of Jean de Brunhoff's Babar and Father Christmas (originally Babar et le p\u00e8re No\u00ebl, 1941), C. S. Lewis's The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1950), Raymond Briggs's Father Christmas (1973), Debbie Macomber's There's Something About Christmas (2005), Robin Jones Gunn's Father Christmas Series (2007), Catherine Spencer's A Christmas to Remember (2007), and Richard Paul Evans's The Gift (2007).\nIn music \n- In 1977, The Kinks recorded the song \"Father Christmas\".\n- In addition, in 1974, Greg Lake (of Emerson, Lake & Palmer) wrote and recorded the song, \"I Believe In Father Christmas\", which was released as a single in 1975.\n- In their 1997 album Pop, U2 cites Father Christmas in the song \"If God Will Send His Angels\".\nSee also \n- J. Simpson and S. Roud, The Oxford Dictionary of English Folklore, Oxford, 2001, pp. 119-20\n- Although an earlier Elizabethan play by satirist Thomas Nashe, Summer's Last Will and Testament (1592), includes a character personifying Christmas, he is atypically presented as a stingy nobleman who shuns festivity. Nashe is satirising wealthy Elizabethan gentry who avoid their traditional duty of feasting the poor at Christmastime.The play text online at Gutenberg.org\n- At the time \"Father\" was a title sometimes given to older men worthy of respect: \"...A respectful title given to an old and venerable man...\" \"father, n.\".

{"text":"What Are The Main Types Of Water Filter?\nThere are several different types of water filters available for use in the home and for other purposes. The type of water filter that you require depends on what you need to use it for.\nFiltering ordinary tap water in the home for the purpose of improving the taste is a common practice. Chlorination and excess minerals can drastically change the taste and smell of tap water, but running the water through a filter can eliminate these substances and make the water taste much better.\nIf you are spending time in the outdoors doing some camping or backpacking, available water sources such as lakes and rivers can be dangerous or even deadly to drink. In this case a slightly more powerful type of water filtration would be needed. Other instances in which you might need to have a much more aggressive method of water filtration is when traveling in foreign countries or in the event of a major disaster such as a flood.\nThe charcoal based water filter is one of the most common of all types of water filter. This is the type of filter that you would find in a typical water filtration pitcher such as the Brita pitcher, and also in most types of on-the-faucet water filters. These types of water filter usually have a cartridge that contains a combination of charcoal and sand. When water is poured through the filter, the charcoal removes chlorine, chemicals and some other contaminants and the sand filters out any larger particles. The end result is clear looking and clean tasting water.\nFor filtration of outdoor water sources when camping and backpacking, a portable reverse osmosis system is one option. Reverse osmosis purifies water by passing it through a semi-permeable membrane, which traps nearly 100% of all contaminants, both chemical and biological. Since biological contaminants such as bacteria and viruses are a major threat in rivers and lakes, it is important to have a water filter that is able to safely remove them.\nOne disadvantage of reverse osmosis is that the process is extremely slow and wastes a lot of water. A reverse osmosis filter can also be a valuable part of any emergency supply kit, because contaminated water is a common hazard encountered in emergency situations. Because reverse osmosis is capable of even removing viruses from water, this type of filter can save lives in countries where there is an extreme shortage of safe drinking water.\nAnother one of the more popular types of water filter is the ceramic microfilter. Like a reverse osmosis system, a ceramic filtration system also uses an ultra-fine material to filter the water. In this case, porous ceramic is used as a filter. The ceramic is fine enough to trap even most bacteria and some types of virus, so they can successfully purify water in most parts of the world. Many ceramic-based water purifiers also incorporate charcoal and sand into the filters to improve taste while offering maximum filtration at the same time.\nTo read more about related subjects, please follow these links:\nBoat Water Filters\nCamping Water Filter\nEmergency Water Filter\nGarden Hose Water Filter\nHiking Water Filters\nOutdoor Water Filters\nPond Water Filters\nPool Water Filters\nPortable Water Filter\nSalt Water Pool Filter\nWater Bottle Filter\nWell Water Filter Systems","id":"<urn:uuid:561597b5-feb8-46a1-aab3-3b16ef83d4cf>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.totallydrinkable.com\/types-of-water-filter.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9402035475,"token_count":677,"score":2.8125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Heart Disease and Abnormal Heart Rhythm (Arrhythmia)\nAn irregular heartbeat is called an arrhythmia, which is not the same as an irregular heart rate. In fact, the two don't necessarily occur together.\nA normal heart rate is 50 to 100 beats per minute. Arrhythmias can occur with a normal heart rate, or with heart rates that are slow or rapid. In the United States, more than 850,000 people are hospitalized for an arrhythmia each year.\nWhat Causes an Arrhythmia?\nArrhythmias may be caused by many different factors, including:\nIrregular heart rhythms can also occur in otherwise normal, healthy hearts.\nWhat Are the Types of Arrhythmias?\nThe types of arrhythmias include:\nPremature atrial contractions. These are early extra beats that originate in the atria (upper chambers of the heart). They are harmless and generally do not require treatment.\nPremature ventricular contractions(PVCs). These are among the most common arrhythmias and occur in people with or without heart disease. This is the skipped heartbeat we all occasionally experience. In some people, it can be related to stress, too much caffeine or nicotine, or too much exercise. But sometimes, PVCs can be caused by heart disease or electrolyte imbalance. People who have a lot of PVCs, and\/or symptoms associated with them, should be evaluated by a heart doctor. However, in most people, PVCs are usually harmless and rarely need treatment.\nAtrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is a very common irregular heart rhythm that causes the atria, the upper chambers of the heart, to contract abnormally.\nAtrial flutter. This is an arrhythmia caused by one or more rapid circuits in the atrium. Atrial flutter is usually more organized and regular than atrial fibrillation. This arrhythmia occurs most often in people with heart disease and in the first week after heart surgery. It often converts to atrial fibrillation.\nParoxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). A rapid heart rate, usually with a regular rhythm, originating from above the ventricles. PSVT begins and ends suddenly. There are two main types: accessory path tachycardias and AV nodal reentrant tachycardias (see below).\nAccessory pathway tachycardias. A rapid heart rate due to an extra abnormal pathway or connection between the atria and the ventricles. The impulses travel through the extra pathways as well as through the usual route. This allows the impulses to travel around the heart very quickly, causing the heart to beat unusually fast.\nAV nodal reentrant tachycardia. A rapid heart rate due to more than one pathway through the AV node. It can cause heart palpitations, fainting, or heart failure. In some cases, it can be terminated using simple maneuvers, such as breathing in and bearing down. Some drugs can also stop this heart rhythm.\nVentricular tachycardia (V-tach). A rapid heart rhythm originating from the lower chambers (or ventricles) of the heart. The rapid rate prevents the heart from filling adequately with blood. This can be a serious arrhythmia, especially in people with heart disease, and may be associated with more symptoms.\nVentricular fibrillation. An erratic, disorganized firing of impulses from the ventricles. The ventricles quiver and are unable to contract or pump blood to the body. This is a medical emergency that must be treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation as soon as possible.\nLong QT syndrome. The QT interval is the area on the electrocardiogram that represents the time it takes for the heart muscle to contract and then recover, or for the electrical impulse to fire impulses and then recharge. When the QT interval is longer than normal, it increases the risk of a life-threatening form of ventricular tachycardia. Long QT syndrome is an inherited condition that can cause sudden death in young people. It can be treated with antiarrhythmic drugs, pacemaker, electrical cardioversion, defibrillation, implanted cardioverter\/defibrillator, or ablation therapy.\nBradyarrhythmias. These are slow heart rhythms, which may arise from disease in the heart's electrical conduction system. Examples include sinus node dysfunction and heart block.\nSinus node dysfunction. A slow heart rhythm due to an abnormal sinus node. Significant sinus node dysfunction that causes symptoms is treated with a pacemaker.\nHeart block. A delay or complete block of the electrical impulse as it travels from the sinus node to the ventricles. The heart may beat irregularly and, often, more slowly.

ASD is characterized by impaired social interactions, difficulty in communicating, and repetitive behaviors. Many other symptoms also can be present, including anxiety, depression, learning disabilities, sleep disorders, and gastrointestinal problems.\nCurrently, diagnosing a child with ASD requires a thorough evaluation by a team of health professionals from a wide range of specialties. Early intervention often can reduce or prevent the more severe symptoms and disabilities associated with ASD.\nAutism specialists and many other people look forward to a day when a test for a biological marker might detect autism risk in young children. To this end, Seattle researchers evaluated porphyrins in the urine of children to determine if the levels of these metabolites could predict ASD.\nThe research team included James Woods, professor of environmental and occupational health sciences at the UW School of Public Health, and Nicholas Heyer and Diana Echeverria, senior scientists at Battelle Centers for Public Health Research and Evaluation\nWhile porphyrins are found in everyone\u2019s urine, the research team observed that certain kinds of these metabolic byproducts are much higher in the urine of some children with autism, compared with typically developing, non-autisitic children of the same age.\nAdditionally, when children with autism were randomly compared with typically developing children or children with other developmental disorders, the porphyrin biomarkers correctly identified more than thirty percent of autistic children without incorrectly identifying a single non-autistic child.\nThe ability to detect porphyrins in a urine sample opens new clinical possibilities. Simple urine tests, if they prove effective, could become a rapid, low-cost, widely available way to screen young children for this type of autism risk.\n\u201cThe significance of this biomarker is not only that it may facilitate earlier detection of autism risk,\u201d said Woods, \u201cbut also that it might help identify those ASD children whose symptoms are specifically associated with altered porphyrin metabolism.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cWhen validated in a larger study, this biomarker could help to identify a specific subset of ASD kids and improve the search for more focused treatment options for these children.\u201d\nThe findings were published in this month\u2019s edition of Autism Research to coincide with Autism Awareness Month. The paper can be found online.\nPartial funding for this research was provided by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.

From a recommended 15 to 20 miles a week, gradually build to a peak mileage range of 30 to 40 miles.\n- Minimize the stress on your body by doing other sports, such as swimming or biking, especially after a long or hard run.\n- Practice the hard\/easy principle. Intersperse stress and rest by taking days off to recover and adapt to marathon training.\n- Increase gradually. Up your training mileage by no more than 10 percent a week.\n- Run at least three long runs, from 18 to 20 miles.\n- Stick with 20 miles. Most experts say there is no reason to go beyond this amount in training, and the risk of injury increases with longer runs.\n- Consider speed work. Faster running isn\u2019t necessary for first-timers, but it can be useful. Make sure to consult an expert, such as a coach.\n- Practice racing. Use shorter events to practice pacing and drinking, and to test running gear.\nTips & Warnings\n- Find a friend or training group. Consider a training partner and\/or a group to help get you through the long runs.\n- Practice mentally as well as physically. The marathon can take enormous concentration.

{"text":"The robot can be outfitted with multiple attachments such as a cell-sprayer that can spray pesticides or fertilizers and can even weed areas intertwined with the crops. It\u2019s able to do so with the help of strategically positioned cameras that take pictures of the ground, which are then sent to an onboard computer that analyzes the images and identifies both the crops and weeds (programmed with 20 known species per geographic area).\nOnce the unwanted plants are identified, it can then spray an herbicide through a row of nozzles placed next to the cameras positioned behind the bot. The cameras look for the corresponding image and either open or close the nozzles based on the weeds' location. With a large range of add-on tools, this robot makes a perfect plant-nursing platform that\u2019s able to keep plants healthy, one column at a time.\nRobots are even being employed to harvest crops, further maximizing the efficiency associated with robotic farmers. One such robot is known as the Robotic Strawberry Harvester from Robotic Harvesting LLC. The mechanical farmhand is autonomous in the true sense of the word and is self-propelled, navigating and harvesting, and as the name suggests, is excellent in picking ripe strawberries. Robot harvesting outfitted the robot with a camera array capable of taking \"stereovision\" photos both above and below the plants leaves to collect data on fruit (whether it\u2019s ripe or not), flower count, plant pathogens (diseases), and other items of interest.\nThe camera system can be reprogrammed to identify and collect data on a number of crops in 3D space (giving the robot the capability to see like humans) not just strawberries, and uses specialized software to discern whether the fruit is ripe. Once identified, the robot uses a three-pronged outfitted robotic arm to pick the fruit, which is then placed on a convenient tiny conveyor belt that drops the fruit off in a collection basket on top of the robot.\nThis may not seem like much, but the robot is capable of picking the fruit (tested in a controlled environment) in as little as two seconds. While you most likely won't see a fully functional efficient farm being run entirely by robots anytime in the next few years, it\u2019s safe to say it certainly is a possibility in the near future. As more and more people populate the planet, using robotic farmers is certainly a viable option in cultivating, nurturing, and harvesting increased food crops in an efficient manner.","id":"<urn:uuid:d0ae3c16-2656-45c7-a6e9-21c6c9e32b92>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.designnews.com\/author.asp?section_id=1386&doc_id=254959&page_number=2","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9457093477,"token_count":514,"score":3.078125,"int_score":3}

Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier. Since then, it has undergone many changes and revisions and become widely popular amongst programmers. Larry Wall continues to oversee development of the core language, and its upcoming version, Perl 6. Perl borrows features from other programming languages including C, shell scripting (sh), AWK, and sed. The language provides powerful text processing facilities without the arbitrary data length limits of many contemporary Unix tools, facilitating easy manipulation of text files. Perl gained widespread popularity in the late 1990s as a CGI scripting language, in part due to its parsing abilities.

{"text":"Interagency Coordinating Council\n\"The mission of the Utah Interagency Coordinating Council for Infants and Toddlers with Special Needs is to assure that each infant and young child with special needs will have the opportunity to achieve optimal health and development within the context of the family.\"\nIntroduction to ICC: Interagency Coordinating Council for Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities and their Families\nWhat is Early Intervention?\nBaby Watch Early Intervention is a statewide, comprehensive, coordinated, interagency, multidisciplinary system, which provides early intervention services to infants and toddlers, younger than three years of age, with developmental delay or disability, and their families. Early intervention is the \"baby\" piece of Special Education. The program is authorized through the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA), Part C, (Early Intervention Program for Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities). In 1987, Utah's Governor designated the Department of Health (DOH) as the \"Lead Agency\" for the early intervention program. Utah was one of the very first states in the nation to fully implement its early intervention program after securing the approval of the State Legislature.\nAt present, there are 16 early intervention programs that serve more than 2,000 children per month in the state. It is anticipated that the demand for these services will continually increase.\nWhat is an Interagency Coordinating Council (ICC)?\nThe creation of an ICC was established with the passage of federal law P.L. 99-457 in October 1986. Developers of the legislation recognized the need for a group outside of the Lead Agency to \"advise and assist\" in the development of such a system. The independent nature of the ICC is one feature that gives the group the potential for making a contribution to the development of the service system.\nAnother feature of the regulations is the multidisciplinary and the multi-constituency representation on the ICC. By specifying what types of members should be included on the ICC, the legislation enables states to bring together consumer, clinical, political, and administrative communities. This merging of a variety of communities facilitates the building of bridges between the involved agencies. In addition, the committee has provided a broader vision of the service system based upon the participation and contributions of all relevant providers and consumers.\nThe ICC, a body required by statute to be appointed by each state's Governor, is to be an important participant in the development of a well-coordinated service system (Federal Interagency Coordinating Council, June, 1989). Each state ICC determines, in conjunction with the Lead Agency, the nature of the roles and tasks it chooses to perform at various policy stages.\nThe Utah ICC is an interagency group whose membership represents the statewide early childhood services community. It is comprised of up to 25 members.\nThe purpose of the Utah ICC is to advise and assist the lead agency in the Division of Community and Family Health Services, Bureau of Children with Special Health Care Needs in the UDOH.\nMuch of the work of the ICC is accomplished in standing committees and ad hoc task force meetings that perform long range planning, study specific issues and make appropriate actions. A member of the ICC chairs each committee.\nWhat role does the ICC play?\nThe Council functions as a planning body at the systems level and advocates for children birth to three years of age and their families with or at-risk for a developmental disability. The Council acts in three major roles:\n(1) ADVISOR: Providing advice to the Lead Agency, Governor and the state legislature on issues related to the development of a coordinated system of early intervention services for children with or at-risk for a developmental disability and their families.\nThe federal law defines the Council membership and the program in order to give it a unique view of the \"service systems\".\nThe parent component of the Council gives it a perspective which may be different from that presented by state agencies which are represented on the Council.\nThe Council can use its special vantage point to be recognized as a source of information for the Lead Agency, Governor, and legislators, as well as other key decision makers in the state.\n(2) NEGOTIATOR: Working as an advocate to encourage a particular course of action by the state.\nA major activity of the Council is to \"review and comment on the annual state plan for services for children birth to three years\" as part of its overall responsibility to assess the service system as it exists in the state. This information as well as interagency coordination is another important goal of the program and puts the Council in a position to be effective in making changes in how services are provided in the state. With agency and provider representatives on the Council, communication can more easily be effected and gaps between agencies can hopefully be bridged.\n(3) CAPACITY BUILDER: Enhancing the ability of the overall service system to address service needs.\nIn this role, the Council works to increase the quality and quantity of desired supports and services from the public and private sectors, to ensure that all needy children and families will be provided early intervention services.","id":"<urn:uuid:ca8c9151-949c-43e8-9c9b-d2e43029f3ed>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/utahbabywatch.org\/icc\/index.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9540891051,"token_count":1031,"score":2.734375,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Courtroom atmospheres, deposition testimony, and cross-examinations have long-standing oral traditions and culture. How does an individual who does not speak participate in such traditions?\nIndividuals who have severe communication impairments of speech and\/or writing may accomplish their communication potential through the use of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). Communication through AAC techniques, symbols, and strategies, however, is not familiar to judges, attorneys, and court recorders within most courtrooms.\nHow do speech-language pathologists adequately prepare persons with complex communication needs (PWCCN) to participate within a cultural environment that is entrenched and centered on the spoken word? What graphic symbols best represent legal concepts such as \"oath,\" \"testimony,\" \"swearing in,\" and \"legal capacity\"? How do PWCCN achieve their right to access justice when their \"voice\" is communicated through a communication assistant and\/or through assistive technology? How may SLPs facilitate modifications within the justice system that allow for an appropriate amount of time for persons with severe physical challenges to respond to a rapid series of questions from attorneys or police? At present, access to justice for persons with severe expressive disorders is difficult.\nThe Legal Arena\nSuppose that an SLP is invited to serve as an expert witness in a case involving a PWCCN. The SLP will work with police, lawyers, and judges in connection with a client. It will be necessary to establish an assessment tool that describes the capacity of the client to testify in court. As an expert witness, the SLP will be challenged immediately by opposing counsel regarding the SLP's competence as an expert as well as his or her choice of assessment tool(s).\nSLPs also need to understand the key differences between the clinical and legal arenas. The justice system is centered on \"winning\" and \"losing.\" Insurance companies participate in determining when to settle and \"walk away\" and end the case. Another difference is the process of evaluation of the client's communication skills. For example, sometimes a proposal for an evaluation must first be submitted to the court and both attorneys for approval before any contact with an individual is permitted. Thus, the SLP may prepare by reading hundreds of pages of clinical and educational reports regarding an individual with an expressive communication disability, and may then need to seek approval for each proposed diagnostic strategy before the actual evaluation. Modifications to the proposed plan may be suggested by either attorney or the judge.\nExperts in litigation today must be familiar with the origin and significance of the Daubert case (Bernstein & Hartsell, 2005). This 1993 landmark decision (Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms. , 509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed.2d 469) resulted in specific instructions for expert testimony introduced into the courtroom. Basically, Daubert's rule established requirements for admissibility of expert testimony, including whether or not the employed technique has been peer-reviewed and published, has a known error rate, can be tested, and is a generally accepted practice within the field.\nAs expert witnesses, SLPs need to prepare for testimony with the understanding that their scientific knowledge will be tested by the opposing attorney, challenged regarding peer reviews and publications, and examined for potential errors and general acceptance by their own scholarly community. Every word and comma in their expert reports will be scrutinized. Although SLPs may feel confident in their professional knowledge base and clinical skills in AAC, writing and defending the expert report within the legal system is very different from preparing a clinical report for a public school or medical facility. To prepare a report for testimony, SLPs need to translate their clinical knowledge into a legally useful form without using jargon, and to follow the rules, roles, and procedures for written reports according to legal tradition. These evaluations and reports must be precise so as not to introduce any reasonable doubt. Failure to understand the purpose and use of a written report may result in a damaging cross-examination and may undermine the SLP's credibility.\nOne example of potential difficulty is establishing a legal capacity for expressive communication when that expression is an alternative form to speech. As yet, there is no legal definition of \"capacity\" for testimony if not through speech. The definition of \"capacity\" is important\u2014a client must be judged to have the \"capacity\" to participate, because a legal case may set a precedent. When assistive technologies, such as speech-generating devices (SGDs) or voice output communication aids (VOCAs), are introduced, the question arises: Does the legal capacity (or definition of expressive communication competence) shift when an SGD is used? In other words, if an individual communicates through technology, is the individual legally more capable as a witness than if he or she communicates without an SGD? Might SLPs need to perform two evaluations for the court? One evaluation might be conducted to determine \"communication capacity\" without technology and another evaluation might determine \"communication capacity\" with technology or AAC strategy.\nCourtrooms may not be accustomed to working with people who use AAC systems. During depositions and testimony, court recorders transcribe speech, but now they must transcribe the language of graphic symbols as reported through communication assistants or through synthetic or digitized speech available within the various technologies. Legal counsel typically examines and cross-examines clients on the witness stand in the courtroom. However, the witness stand may not accommodate a person with a disability seated in a power wheelchair and his or her communication partner; SLPs may need to suggest modifications to courtroom seating arrangements. Judges may not accept testimony by a communication assistant in lieu of actual testimony by the client. Training programs for judges and attorneys may be necessary for greater acceptance of communication through AAC systems and other strategies.\nAttorneys often challenge the origins of the communication messages; i.e., the \"independence\" of each communication message may be examined and cross-examined if programmed by the SLP. The \"author\" of each communication expression emerging from a synthesized or digitized SGD may be scrutinized. SLPs may be accused of speaking for individuals whom they are assisting. Such challenges can be addressed if the SLP orients attorneys and judges prior to the trial to the person's disabilities, use of AAC, types of vocabulary, and characteristics of appropriate questioning techniques for PWCCN. SLPs will need to understand that individuals are eligible for accommodations, and that they may be responsible for requesting accommodations on behalf of the individual and his or her assistants.\nScope of Practice Issues\nResponsibilities for SLPs are expanding as public agencies are processing an increasing number of complaints on behalf of consumers. Cases of abuse, fraud, malpractice, and denial of basic services to PWCCN impact speech-language pathology practices because communication is often at the core of each case. In an administrative or court proceeding, SLPs may become involved in legal practices and procedures that extend beyond their education and training. SLPs need to acquire the knowledge and skills to assist individuals who use AAC in pursuing their basic human right to access justice (Huer et al., 2006). An SLP preparing to testify in these types of court cases should acquire knowledge and skills such as:\n- Becoming familiar with the legal process, including understanding the steps and procedures for pre-trial processes, discovery, and investigation\n- Learning the basic rules of law, including definitions such as legal \"capacity\" to testify, and consistency and reliability of testimony by PWCCN\n- Identifying the various challenges to testimony and to evaluation\n- Advocating for accommodations for PWCCN, when appropriate, throughout the legal process\nSLPs who enter the legal arena must coordinate their activities with the attorney with whom they are working. \"Full disclosure by the attorney of the nature and characteristics of the proceedings, a thorough review of the SLP's testimony, and extensive rehearsal are the key elements of a successful relationship and the necessary ingredients to maximize the potential for a positive outcome for the client,\" according to Lew Golinker, an attorney with the Assistive Technology Law Center in Ithaca, NY.\nSLPs need to know the procedures involved in the filing of charges and questioning of clients. When a client who does not use speech for expressive communication is questioned, new challenges emerge. Procedural rules create the need for new or different types of practices or procedures in AAC. The conversations between the SLP and the client, the programming of AAC device, and the rules for conversations during court proceedings must be understood in advance; if not, the case may be thrown out or introduce \"reasonable doubt,\" possibly affecting the outcome of the case.\nIn addition, procedural rules for legal proceedings demand that testimony during depositions and during a trial be the same. The person with a disability as well as SLPs need to understand the necessity for consistency and reliability of response every time the same question is asked and answered. Further, when communicating through alternative forms for expressive communication, it may be difficult to convey to a PWCCN\u2014especially one with intellectual disability\u2014the meaning of \"testifying under oath.\" If the communication is through graphic symbols, what does the symbol for \"oath\" look like? (See page 7 for a photo that has been used to communicate this concept.)\nThe person with a disability should understand what to expect and what is expected prior to testifying in court. The SLP should realize, and explain to the client, that testimony during a police investigation is different from testifying in court, especially during cross-examination. Often, contact with police in filing a complaint is brief, and courtroom procedures often occur long after the initial complaint. This time lapse may prove challenging for a witness who has difficulty with long-term memory, and the SLP may need to find ways to remind the client about past events without leading the person to the \"correct\" answer.\nLitigation consultation is a relatively new arena for SLPs. Legal advocacy for PWCCN is a complex process that is only beginning to be identified and understood by professionals in the field of AAC. While involvement in legal issues is an exciting extension of practice, SLPs should pursue additional education before entering into the legal arena (see sidebar for resources). During courtroom cross-examination, the written reports and professional credibility of the SLP are as much in question as the capacities of the person with a disability. With appropriate knowledge and skills, advocating for justice for people who use AAC is an important responsibility for SLPs.","id":"<urn:uuid:0fb998a9-5e9f-4d5c-a102-efcf260468d9>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.asha.org\/Publications\/leader\/2006\/061226\/f061226a.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9500997066,"token_count":2132,"score":3.046875,"int_score":3}

Babies with CF may not gain weight well, and have frequent chest infections. Screening means that babies with CF can be treated early with a high energy diet, medicines and physiotherapy. Although a child with CF may still become very ill, early treatment is thought to help them live longer, healthier lives. If babies are not screened for CF and they do have the condition, they can be tested later but parents may have an anxious time before CF is recognised.","id":"<urn:uuid:056585ae-f5ca-4423-af74-1d18f0223da1>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/newbornbloodspot.screening.nhs.uk\/cf\/cms.php?folder=2647","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9718625546,"token_count":122,"score":3.25,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Did you ever stop to consider just how a volcano works? Of course it is only theory for no one has as yet dissected a volcano while it was active to observe and tabulate the reactions of its inner self. Rainier is a volcanic cone and no doubt it came into being in this manner.\nFirst at a depth below the surface of the earth in some long, forgotten time the magma or molten rock presed toward the surface possibly throuhg some fracture in the outer crust. With these rising lavas there was also much gas that advanced ahead of the lava and thus both the gas and the lava pressed toward the surface gradually accumulating force and power under the pressure as its advance was hindered by the solid material above. And then finally this flow of motlen rock and gases achieved enogh power to burst through the surface. First, possibly, there was an explosive action as the gases burst upward and this was followed by more quiet flows of the lavas that welled out over the surface and inundated, in succeeding eruptions and lava flows, over 100 square miles of surrounding country which is the area of \"The Mountain's\" great base.\nAnd in that manner eruptions followed one another when the pressure within the throat of this fire mountain achieved enough power to burst through the \"plug\" of hardened lavas which solidified after each flow. Rainier hasn't been active for several thousands of years and there is apparently little chance of its becoming active again but it stands today - a magnificent volcanic shaft, its flanks glistening with the greatest glacial system in continentaly United States, - a monument to nature's power in its wildest moods.\n|<<< Previous||> Cover <|","id":"<urn:uuid:c692f9d4-0ff8-4583-84fe-ef3293415e17>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/history\/history\/online_books\/mora\/notes\/vol8-13d.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9618353844,"token_count":349,"score":3.46875,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Cancer Fighting Foods\/Spices\nThe National Cancer Institute estimates that roughly one-third of all cancer deaths may be diet related. What you eat can hurt you, but it can also help you. Many of the common foods found in grocery stores or organic markets contain cancer-fighting properties, from the antioxidants that neutralize the damage caused by free radicals to the powerful phytochemicals that scientists are just beginning to explore. There isn\u2019t a single element in a particular food that does all the work: The best thing to do is eat a variety of foods.\nThe following foods have the ability to help stave off cancer and some can even help inhibit cancer cell growth or reduce tumor size.\nAvocados are rich in glutathione, a powerful antioxidant that attacks free radicals in the body by blocking intestinal absorption of certain fats. They also supply even more potassium than bananas and are a strong source of beta-carotene. Scientists also believe that avocados may also be useful in treating viral hepatitis (a cause of liver cancer), as well as other sources of liver damage.\nBroccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower have a chemical component called indole-3-carbinol that can combat breast cancer by converting a cancer-promoting estrogen into a more protective variety. Broccoli, especially sprouts, also have the phytochemical sulforaphane, a product of glucoraphanin \u2013 believed to aid in preventing some types of cancer, like colon and rectal cancer. Sulforaphane induces the production of certain enzymes that can deactivate free radicals and carcinogens. The enzymes have been shown to inhibit the growth of tumors in laboratory animals. However, be aware that the Agriculture Department studied 71 types of broccoli plants and found a 30-fold difference in the amounts of glucoraphanin. It appears that the more bitter the broccoli is, the more glucoraphanin it has. Broccoli sprouts have been developed under the trade name BroccoSprouts that have a consistent level of sulforaphane \u2013 as much as 20 times higher than the levels found in mature heads of broccoli.\nCarrots contain a lot of beta carotene, which may help reduce a wide range of cancers including lung, mouth, throat, stomach, intestine, bladder, prostate and breast. Some research indicated beta carotene may actually cause cancer, but this has not proven that eating carrots, unless in very large quantities \u2013 2 to 3 kilos a day, can cause cancer. In fact, a substance called falcarinol that is found in carrots has been found to reduce the risk of cancer, according to researchers at Danish Institute of Agricultural Sciences (DIAS). Kirsten Brandt, head of the research department, explained that isolated cancer cells grow more slowly when exposed to falcarinol. This substance is a polyacethylen, however, so it is important not to cook the carrots.\nChili peppers and jalapenos contain a chemical, capsaicin, which may neutralize certain cancer-causing substances (nitrosamines) and may help prevent cancers such as stomach cancer.\nNovember 20, 2008 at 3:27 pm\nMaybe you should be eating more beets, left, or chopped cabbage. (Credit: Evan Sung for The New York Times, left\nNutritionist and author Jonny Bowden has created several lists of healthful foods people should be eating but aren\u2019t. But some of his favorites, like purslane, guava and goji berries, aren\u2019t always available at regular grocery stores. I asked Dr. Bowden, author of \u201cThe 150 Healthiest Foods on Earth,\u201d to update his list with some favorite foods that are easy to find but don\u2019t always find their way into our shopping carts. Here\u2019s his advice.\n- Beets: Think of beets as red spinach, Dr. Bowden said, because they are a rich source of folate as well as natural red pigments that may be cancer fighters.\nHow to eat: Fresh, raw and grated to make a salad. Heating decreases the antioxidant power.\n- Cabbage: Loaded with nutrients like sulforaphane, a chemical said to boost cancer-fighting enzymes.\nHow to eat: Asian-style slaw or as a crunchy topping on burgers and sandwiches.\n- Swiss chard: A leafy green vegetable packed with carotenoids that protect aging eyes.\nHow to eat it: Chop and saute in olive oil.\n- Cinnamon: Helps control blood sugar and cholesterol.\nHow to eat it: Sprinkle on coffee or oatmeal.\n- Pomegranate juice: Appears to lower blood pressure and loaded with antioxidants.\nHow to eat: Just drink it.\n- Dried plums: Okay, so they are really prunes, but packed with cancer-fighting antioxidants.\nHow to eat: Wrapped in prosciutto and baked.\n- Pumpkin seeds: The most nutritious part of the pumpkin and packed with magnesium; high levels of the mineral are associated with lower risk for early death.\nHow to eat: Roasted as a snack, or sprinkled on salad.\n- Sardines: Dr. Bowden calls them \u201chealth food in a can.\u2019\u2019 They are high in omega-3\u2019s, contain virtually no mercury and are loaded with calcium. They also contain iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, copper and manganese as well as a full complement of B vitamins.\nHow to eat: Choose sardines packed in olive or sardine oil. Eat plain, mixed with salad, on toast, or mashed with dijon mustard and onions as a spread.\n- Turmeric: The \u201csuperstar of spices,\u2019\u2019 it has anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties.\nHow to eat: Mix with scrambled eggs or in any vegetable dish.\n- Frozen blueberries: Even though freezing can degrade some of the nutrients in fruits and vegetables, frozen blueberries are available year-round and don\u2019t spoil; associated with better memory in animal studies.\nHow to eat: Blended with yogurt or chocolate soy milk and sprinkled with crushed almonds.\n- Canned pumpkin: A low-calorie vegetable that is high in fiber and immune-stimulating vitamin A; fills you up on very few calories.\nHow to eat: Mix with a little butter, cinnamon and nutmeg.\nYou can find more details and recipes on the Men\u2019s Health Web site, which published the original version of the list last year.\nIn my own house, I only have two of these items \u2014 pumpkin seeds, which I often roast and put on salads, and frozen blueberries, which I mix with milk, yogurt and other fruits for morning smoothies.

Have any of these foods found their way into your shopping cart?\nCourtesy: New York Times\nJuly 1, 2008 at 9:06 am","id":"<urn:uuid:055624c0-62af-41df-8f11-60150520d344>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/funinlife.wordpress.com\/tag\/health\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9453785419,"token_count":1450,"score":3.15625,"int_score":3}

They install a freely accessible computer and observe the rest. This computer created instant ripples and the inferences were revolutionary. The slum children not only learn basic computer skills but teach other children as well. This experiment known as the Hole in the Wall is the discovery of Professor Sugata Mitra. He also coined the concept of Minimally Invasive Education; a pedagogy under which children driven by curiosity and peer support teach themselves and others.\nProfessor Sugata Mitra had always been fascinated with the idea of unsupervised learning and computers and when finally he put it into practice, it won him another award. On Tuesday, February 26. Dr. Mitra was given the TED Award 2013 which grants him $1 million to set up his own learning laboratory based on this concept.\nDr. Mitra plans to set up learning spaces that would be totally automated and controlled from the Cloud. The supervisor will not be a teacher or a computer expert but only a safety and health supervisor. Probably set up in India, these learning spaces would take the Hole in the Wall Experiment to the implementation stage.\nDr. Mitra has been the Chief Scientist at NIIT and is currently Professor of Educational Technology at Newcastle University, UK. Dr. Mitra is a winner of \u201cMan of Peace Award\u201d from Together for Peace Foundation, USA, and \u201cSocial Innovation Award\u201d from Institute of Social Inventions, UK. He has also been given the \u201cDewang Mehta Award\u201d by the Government of India in recognition for his work related to Hole-in-the-Wall.\nAccording to Dr.Mitra, the learners of the new age need two things. A broadband connection and a teacher to stand back. He says, \u201cThe Victorians were great engineers. They engineered a [schooling] system that was so robust that it\u2019s still with us today, continuously producing identical people for a machine that no longer exists.\u201d\nWe were fortunate enough to have Prof. Mitra with us in one of the WizIQ Conversations.

{"text":"Correlation and Application of Statistics to Problems of Heredity 63\nOxford, and the three last were two men who committed suicide under circumstances of great disgrace and Palmer, the Rugeley murderer, who was hanged. There is possibly little knowledge to be obtained from the result for a single medical school, but comparative statistics for several would be of considerable value.\nChapter V deals with Normal Variability, and Galton shows how the distribution depends only on the two constants, the median and the quartile, and further that if two individuals whose grades are known be actually measured, then the median and quartile, and so the whole distribution of variation, can be discovered (p. 62, footnote, and cf. our Vol. II, p. 385). The origin of the normal distribution is illustrated mechanically by aid of the \" quincunx \" (see our pp. 9 and 10). Nor is Galton able to avoid becoming poetically enthusiastic in a paragraph headed The Charms of Statistics, for he writes\n\"It is difficult to understand why statisticians commonly limit their inquiries to averages and do not revel in more comprehensive views. Their souls seem as dull to the charm of variety as that of the native of one of our flat English counties, whose retrospect of Switzerland was that, if its mountains could be thrown into its lakes, two nuisances would be got rid of at once. An average is but a solitary fact, whereas if a single other fact be added to it, an entire Normal Scheme, which nearly corresponds to the observed one, starts potentially into existence.\n\"Some people hate the very name of statistics, but I find them full of beauty and interest. Whenever they are not brutalised, but delicately handled by the higher methods, and are warily interpreted, their power of dealing with complicated phenomena is extraordinary. They are the only tools by which an opening can be cut through the formidable thicket of difficulties that bars the path of those who pursue the Science of Man.\" (pp. 62-63.)\nGalton at the end of his Chapter V gives the two fundamental propositions on which his normal surface for the distribution of characters in two relatives depends. He envisages it in the following manner.\n\"(1) Bullets are fired by a man who aims at the centre of a target, which we will call its 11f, and we will suppose the marks that the bullets make to be painted red, for the sake of distinction. The system of lateral deviations of these red marks from the centre M will be approximately Normal, whose Q [Probable Error] we will call c. [This is the distribution of the first relative.] Then another man takes aim, not at the centre of the target, but at one or other of the red marks, selecting these at random. We will suppose his shots to be painted green. The lateral distance of any green shot from the red mark at which it was aimed will have a Probable Error, that we will call b. Now if the lateral distance of a particular green mark from M is given [a], what is the most probable distance from M of the red mark at which it was aimed?\nIt is + b2 a*.\n\"(2) What is the Probable Error of this determination? In other words, if estimates have been made for a great many distances founded upon the formula in (1), they would be correct on the average, though erroneous in particular cases. The errors thus made would form a normal\nsystem whose Q [Probable Error] it is desired to determine. Its value is ,\/b2 L2 1.\"\n* Unfortunately Galton has the value V O + b21 which is very liable to confuse the reader. t In more modern notation, this may be looked upon as the variability of the array of the\nsecond relative = c2 (1 -?-'I); therefore r = .\/c2\/(c2 +b 2). Hence the regression of first relative on second relative = rc\/ Jc2 + b2 x a = ~ + b2 x a. Again the variance of the difference in character\nbetween the two relatives = c2 + (c2 + b2) - 2c1\/c2 + b2 r = b2, or b has for physical meaning the probable error of the distribution of the difference in character between the two relatives.","id":"<urn:uuid:20c7beae-1f7d-4186-b2cf-5cd460c3597a>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/galton.org\/cgi-bin\/searchImages\/galton\/search\/pearson\/vol3a\/pages\/vol3a_0082.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9603128433,"token_count":890,"score":2.546875,"int_score":3}

{"text":"And as good as today's beginning stages of deflation may feel, especially when filling up at a service station or shopping for a house, economists warn that there is a high price to pay down the road and that current monetary policy is only raising that price.\nOf course, not all price reductions are created equal. A price drop that stems primarily from an increase in technological efficiency is not deflation; it's progress. Deflation is a fall in prices that stems from a shrinking money supply, just as inflation is a price hike that stems from an increase in the supply of money.\nDeflation ramps up when people borrow to make a big purchase on the assumption that what they are buying will be worth more later. But if prices fall, the loan will have to be repaid in dollars that are worth more than the dollars they borrowed, making the debt more onerous. As a result, when people expect falling prices, they become less willing to spend, and in particular less willing to borrow. And when that happens, the economy may stay depressed because people expect deflation, and deflation may continue because the economy remains depressed. It's a nasty cycle and it can often be traced back to the central bank's balance sheet expansion.\nDeflation is the one thing that a leveraged economy can't handle, said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research. The implication on the whole economy is potentially ruinous. The idea that every time the stock markets have some kind of a hiccup and they [the Fed policymakers] need to rush in with some sort of quantitative ease is a dangerous road for them to go on.\nDeflation is always a risk if you engage in a policy of inflation, said Albert Lu, managing director and chief portfolio manager of WB Advisors.\nThe problem with the addiction to money-printing is that it can't stop without dire -- albeit in the long-term healthy -- short-term economic consequences, he said.\nTo jump-start the economy, the central bank would increase the money supply and bank credit to support certain sectors or projects. That's what the Fed did after the dot-com bubble of 1995-2000 burst. The problem is that once the Fed stops the infusion of additional credit and money, deflation rapidly takes hold. It then takes an ever-increasing amount of new money creation to achieve a temporary suppression of deflation's symptoms.\nInflation-sustained projects are unsustainable because the expansion rests on government fiat, not economic fundamentals like supply and demand. Take the government's determination to promote home ownership. That public policy was advanced with easy money, especially during Alan Greenspan's leadership of the Fed, compulsory lending to unqualified borrowers and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buying tranches of subprime mortgages. Home ownership boomed. And then it collapsed. Home prices still haven't recovered: U.S. home prices fell in March (the latest data available), ending the first quarter at the lowest levels since the housing crisis began in mid-2006, according to Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller home-price indexes. Prices are down roughly 35 percent from their peak in the second quarter of 2006.\nEssentially, as soon as the government stops the expansion, you are going to hit one of these deflationary corrections with all of the nasty business cycles that accompany it, Lu said.\nAnd often how the government reacts to that is with additional stimulus. For a third year in a row, the U.S. is seeing an economic slowdown and in response, policymakers could be unveiling policy sequels such as: Fiscal Stimulus 4, Operation Twist 2 or Quantitative Easing 3.\nThey are basically keeping the thing going by continuously adding money and credit, Lu said. This is just delaying the correction we need.\nWe've been prolonging the agony, and the final correction will be much worse than it had to be, Lu said.\nLet Them Fail\nThe depression of 1920-21 shows why the Fed should sit on its collective hands at their June Federal Open Market Committee meeting.\nFrom the spring of 1920 to the summer of 1921, nominal gross domestic product fell by 23.9 percent, wholesale prices by 40.8 percent and the consumer price index dropped by 8.3 percent. Meanwhile, unemployment topped out at about 14 percent from a pre-bust level of as low as 2 percent.\nIn response, the administration of Warren G. Harding balanced the budget and the Fed tightened money supply, pushing up short-term rates in mid-depression to as high as 8.13 percent.\nHarding also decided to let the ailing businesses fail. Then something wonderful happened: The economy purged itself and by 1923, the nation's unemployment rate fell back to 3.2 percent.\nThere was no government bailout, no rock-bottom interest rates, no QE, no stimulus of any kind. Yet the depression ended.\nWe actually need a deflation. Believe it or not, it's actually healthy, Lu said. However painful it is, deflation is the natural consequence of prior inflation and is a necessary step in the economic recovery.\nTrying to avoid it through additional Fed action will prolong the depression, Lu said.","id":"<urn:uuid:03b5b79f-c0ee-4372-9eef-383f13bec1be>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.ibtimes.com\/us-economists-warn-fed-setting-us-deflation-705540","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9550973177,"token_count":1057,"score":2.625,"int_score":3}

It is an ancient medieval town with a fortress Chateau de Foix perched on a hill overlooking it. The fortress has been attacked many times without capture, including an attempt by Simon de Montfort. It has also been used as a prison, and the names of English prisoners of war can still be seen on the cell walls. Another famous chateau in the Ari\u00e8ge is Monts\u00e9gur, located on a rocky outcrop at a height of 1200 metres (3,900 ft). During the Albigensian Crusade and siege of 1244 AD the chateau was largely destroyed, with more than two hundred Cathar priests burnt at the stake as heretics. The chateau was gradually rebuilt by Royalists over a period of the next three hundred years.\nThe start of the seventeenth century saw the area ravaged by wars between Protestants and Catholics. In 1621 Huguenot forces ruined the church at La Tour-du-Crieu. In 1629 Pamiers was sacked by Henry of Cond\u00e9 following uprisings that left several hundred dead in the city. This was also the period during which the abbeys at Foix, Tarascon-sur-Ari\u00e8ge, Saint-Girons, Saverdun and Le Mas-d'Azil were torched and destroyed.\nThe nineteenth century was a time of strong industrial growth, supported in Ari\u00e8ge by an abundant supply of water power. The department also benefitted from its significant reserves of iron ore. The growth of iron based industries were a feature of the period, with the establishment in 1817 of a steel manufacturing plant at Pamiers which has been a principal driver of the local economy ever since. Other representative examples of the iron based industry that developed in Ari\u00e8ge during the nineteenth century include the forges at Montgaillard and the blast furnaces at Tarascon-sur-Ari\u00e8ge.\nDescription of the department's industrial development during the nineteenth century should also include mention of the paper industry at Saint-Girons and the textile industry in the Pays d'Olmes.\nTowns of particular historical interest in the d\u00e9partement include Pamiers, host to a large commercial centre and three churches. Mirepoix is a medieval town, as is Saint-Lizier situated on a hilltop with winding streets, fine views and a church with cloisters that are noteworthy. Saint-Girons is an agricultural centre with a Saturday market.\nThe geography is dominated by the Pyrenees mountains, which form the border between France and Spain. There are hundreds of miles of well-marked paths which allow exploration of the magnificent Pyrenees mountains. The high mountains are easily accessible via good roads, cable cars or by foot. There are a number of lodges providing high level mountain accommodation that are comfortable, warm and with good meals.\nThere are also a number of fresh water lakes which provide a variety of activities including, walking, swimming, fishing, canoeing, sailboarding and picnicking.\nThe Ariege has several of its own downhill ski resorts, the three largest being Ax-Bonascre, Les Monts D'Olmes and Guzet-Neige. There are many cross country ski-ing resorts, one of the best being at Plateau de Beille, near Les Cabannes.\nThe Pyrenees mountain range forms a fantastic backdrop to the entire Ari\u00e8ge Department, rising some 10,000 feet (3000m) in the Montcalm Massif, along the border with Andorra and Spain. The highest peaks are clearly visible visible from Toulouse in the Haute Garonne. It is one of the least populated and most unspoiled regions of France. The locals enjoy keeping traditions alive, especially old farming techniques. Consequently, as fewer insecticides, for example, have been used, the flora and fauna of the area continue to be rich in both diversity and numbers. Butterflies are common and birds are numerous; particularly noticeable are large birds of prey, including the magnificent Griffon vultures.\nThere are also many unspoiled villages and hamlets tucked away in the valleys close to the department's border with Spain \u2013 Seix, Cominac and Aulus Les Bain are examples \u2013 together with picturesque mountain villages, most notably Aleu which comes alive in the holiday season.\nAri\u00e8ge stands on the eastern limit of oceanic dominance over rainfall, but other influences are felt:\n- Mediterranean \u2013 particularly visible in the vegetation of the foothills and of the valley of the Ari\u00e8ge river towards Tarascon, and in the Pays de Sault;\n- Continental \u2013 in the Pyrenean valleys, with many storms and big differences of temperature between day and night.\nThere is no great tendency to summer drought as the flow of air from the north-west brings rain throughout the year. Rainfall is moderate on the foothills and in some sheltered valleys, measuring 700 to 1,000 mm per year, but increases significantly in the higher valleys with levels between 1,000 mm and 1,800 mm. The slopes exposed to the north-west, such as Aulus and Orlu, are, as one would expect, the wettest, together with the frontal ridges that meet air flow from the southwest (giving rise to the Foehn effect). Snow cover is common over 1,000 metres, lasting several months above 1,500 to 2,000 metres. Some periglacial areas exist over 2,500 m but the only true glacier in Ari\u00e8ge is that of Mont Valier, near Castillon-en-Couserans.\nTemperatures are mild in the foothills, e.g. at the city of Foix (400 metres) the average is 5 \u00b0C in January and 19 \u00b0C in July. However, they decline rapidly with elevation, e.g. at l'Hospitalet-pr\u00e8s-l'Andorre (1,430 m) it is 0 \u00b0C in January and 14 \u00b0C in July.\nThe inhabitants of the department are called Ari\u00e9geois.\nThe department has 151,477 inhabitants, or 146,289 as the population without double counting.\nThe populations of the arrondissements (double-counting) are :\n- Foix \u2013 53,595\n- Pamiers \u2013 69,664\n- Saint Girons \u2013 28,218\nThe populations of the principal towns (double-counting) are :\n- Pamiers \u2013 15,702\n- Foix \u2013 9,994\n- Lavelanet \u2013 7,068\n- Saint Girons \u2013 7,019\nThe Ariege department is a largely unknown department which is situated next to the Aude in the most southern part of the Midi-Pyrenees region and shares its borders with the Aude, Andorra, Haute Garonne and the Pyrenees Orientales.

Broadly speaking, Ari\u00e8ge has been firmly held by the Socialist Party since the days of the Third Republic, although in recent years the right has managed to make some inroads.\nNevertheless, the department remains one of the most left-wing departments in France, and the left holds all but three of the department's 22 cantons.\nThe President of the General Council is Augustin Bonrepaux of the Socialist Party.\n|Union for a Popular Movement||2|\nAri\u00e9geois gastronomy is based on the cooking of Pyrenean regional food, such as cheese or charcuterie from the mountain country.

{"text":"Real form (Lie theory)\nIn mathematics, the notion of a real form relates objects defined over the field of real and complex numbers. A real Lie algebra g0 is called a real form of a complex Lie algebra g if g is the complexification of g0:\nReal forms for Lie groups and algebraic groups \nUsing the Lie correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras, the notion of a real form can be defined for Lie groups. In the case of linear algebraic groups, the notions of complexification and real form have a natural description in the language of algebraic geometry.\nJust as complex semisimple Lie algebras are classified by Dynkin diagrams, the real forms of a semisimple Lie algebra are classified by Satake diagrams, which are obtained from the Dynkin diagram of the complex form by labeling some vertices black (filled), and connecting some other vertices in pairs by arrows, according to certain rules.\nIt is a basic fact in the structure theory of complex semisimple Lie algebras that every such algebra has two special real forms: one is the compact real form and corresponds to a compact Lie group under the Lie correspondence (its Satake diagram has all vertices blackened), and the other is the split real form and corresponds to a Lie group that is as far as possible from being compact (its Satake diagram has no vertices blackened and no arrows). In the case of the complex special linear group SL(n,C), the compact real form is the special unitary group SU(n) and the split real form is the real special linear group SL(n,R). The classification of real forms of semisimple Lie algebras was accomplished by \u00c9lie Cartan in the context of Riemannian symmetric spaces. In general, there may be more than two real forms.\nSuppose that g0 is a semisimple Lie algebra over the field of real numbers. By Cartan's criterion, the Killing form is nondegenerate, and can be diagonalized in a suitable basis with the diagonal entries +1 or -1. By Sylvester's law of inertia, the number of positive entries, or the positive index of intertia, is an invariant of the bilinear form, i.e. it does not depend on the choice of the diagonalizing basis. This is a number between 0 and the dimension of g which is an important invariant of the real Lie algebra, called its index.\nSplit real form \nA real form g0 of a complex semisimple Lie algebra g is said to be split, or normal, if in each Cartan decomposition g0 = k0 \u2295 p0, the space p0 contains a maximal Abelian subalgebra of g0, i.e. its Cartan subalgebra. \u00c9lie Cartan proved that every complex semisimple Lie algebra g has a split real form, which is unique up to isomorphism. It has maximal index among all real forms.\nThe split form corresponds to the Satake diagram with no vertices blackened and no arrows.\nCompact real form \nA real Lie algebra g0 is called compact if the Killing form is negative definite, i.e. the index of g0 is zero. In this case g0 = k0 is a compact Lie algebra. It is known that under the Lie correspondence, compact Lie algebras correspond to compact Lie groups.\nThe compact form corresponds to the Satake diagram with all vertices blackened.\nConstruction of the compact real form \nIn general, the construction of the compact real form uses structure theory of semisimple Lie algebras. For classical Lie algebras there is a more explicit construction.\nLet g0 be a real Lie algebra of matrices over R that is closed under the transpose map,\nThe complexification g of g0 decomposes into the direct sum of g0 and ig0. The real vector space of matrices\nis a subspace of the complex Lie algebra g that is closed under the commutators and consists of skew-hermitian matrices. It follows that u0 is a real Lie subalgebra of g, that its Killing form is negative definite (making it a compact Lie algebra), and that the complexification of u0 is g. Therefore, u0 is a compact form of g.\nSee also \n- Helgason 1978, p. 426","id":"<urn:uuid:307c1388-d49d-46d7-a722-4f52f24df709>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Real_form_(Lie_theory)","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.8964980245,"token_count":938,"score":2.875,"int_score":3}

Retrograde motion can be seen each time Earth overtakes and laps planets orbiting farther from the Sun, Earth moving more rapidly through its own relatively close-in orbit. Astronomer Tunc Tezel captured Jupiter and Saturn's \"paired\" retrograde loop in this remarkable series made after the close alignment of these gas giants in May 2000. The next opportunity to see these two planets dance such a pas de deux will be in the year 2020.\nAuthors & editors:\nJerry Bonnell (USRA)\nNASA Technical Rep.: Jay Norris.

{"text":"November 9, 2012\nA couple of cups of coffee may help our brains process some words faster, a small experiment suggests. But we only get the message faster if the words are emotionally positive. The study included 66 healthy young men. They were told to consume no caffeine, nicotine or alcohol in the 12 hours before the experiment. The men were randomly divided into 2 groups. One group took a tablet containing 200 milligrams of coffee, about the amount in 2 to 3 cups of coffee. Each person in the other group received a placebo (fake) pill. Half an hour later, the men were given tests that involved being shown a series of real and invented words. They had to press buttons to indicate whether a word was real or not. Men who took the caffeine pills did this faster and more accurately for words with a positive emotional connotation. They did not perform better than men who got the placebo pills for recognizing neutral or negative words. The journal PLoS One published the study online. HealthDay News wrote about it November 8.\nBy Howard LeWine, M.D.\nHarvard Medical School\nWhat Is the Doctor's Reaction?\nYou often hear people say things like \"Don't talk to me. I haven't had my coffee yet.\" Researchers from Germany offer us new insight into why we might feel that way. The study comes from the Department of Psychology at Ruhr University.\nIn general, people recognize and process the meaning of words faster if the words have a positive emotional slant. What these researchers found is that caffeine speeds up that link even more. But caffeine did not speed up how quickly people recognize and process emotionally neutral or negative words.\nLow doses of caffeine tend to put you in a more positive mood. Caffeine also generally helps you do mental tasks faster and with fewer errors. Now we can add the faster processing of positively charged emotional content. These are good explanations for why you want that first cup of coffee before talking to anyone.\nHow caffeine affects the brain is not completely understood. But here is how most experts explain it.\nCaffeine gets absorbed in the stomach and small intestine. It enters the blood stream and is distributed throughout the body, including the brain.\nOnce it reaches the brain, caffeine probably has multiple targets. But the main one seems to be adenosine receptors. Adenosine is a chemical that dampens brain activity. This counters the action of another brain chemical, dopamine.\nDopamine acts as a brain stimulant and mood enhancer. By hogging the adenosine receptor sites, caffeine doesn't allow adenosine to dampen brain activity. This puts the balance in favor of dopamine. It leads to feeling more awake and alert, with a more positive mood.\nWhat Changes Can I Make Now?\nOverall, coffee is generally safe when used in moderation. But the key word is moderation.\nIn some people, too much caffeinated coffee can raise blood pressure. Teenagers seem to be more susceptible to an increase in blood pressure from caffeine.\nCoffee also can interfere with how well your body absorbs iron and calcium. But you need to drink a lot of coffee for it to greatly lower the amount of iron and calcium in your bloodstream. And it's not the caffeine that interferes with the absorption. It's related to another ingredient in coffee called phenolic acid. So decaf coffee also will decrease absorption of these minerals.\nDepending on how you make your coffee, it can raise cholesterol levels a little. Again, it's not the caffeine that influences cholesterol levels. It's the coffee oil from the bean. If you boil or press your coffee, then the coffee oil gets into the brew. However, today most coffee in the United States is filtered through paper. And filtered coffee does not increase cholesterol levels.\nSo what's the bottom line? If you are already a coffee drinker, enjoy it. If you don't drink coffee, processing of words that convey positive emotions is not a good enough reason to start.\nThere's probably some amount of coffee (and other drinks containing caffeine) that carries a risk of real health hazards. I am still unclear as to what that level is for an otherwise healthy adult.\nMy advice: If even one cup of coffee makes you jittery or anxious, or interferes with sleep, that is one cup too many. I am honest with patients. I don't know if 10 cups of coffee per day is too much. I would not drink that much; 3 cups per day is my own limit.\nWhat Can I Expect Looking to the Future?\nThe great majority of medical studies looking at coffee drinkers have shown better health outcomes for people who drink coffee. Almost none have suggested that coffee is bad for you. In fact, my personal limit of three cups per day may be too cautious. Maybe I'd be better off drinking more!","id":"<urn:uuid:89e82935-b31c-4a4c-9c49-78b21d4506fa>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/intelihealth.com\/IH\/ihtPrint\/WSIHW000\/24479\/36146\/1462355.html?d=dmtContent&hide=t&k=basePrint","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.958098948,"token_count":996,"score":3.078125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"The giving of the law at Mount Sinai was the climax of a series of events that began at Passover, the moment and the means of the Israelites' redemption. At Passover they killed a lamb and put the blood on their doorposts. When the death angel passed through to slay the firstborn, those who had blood on the doorposts were spared. God was saving, redeeming, buying back His people.\nMount Sinai adds the other half of the equation. Though redemption through the blood of a lamb (Christ) freed them from sin's dominion and death, the giving of the law at Mount Sinai shows that freeing them is not all that God had in mind. Israel came to Mount Sinai after being redeemed, heard the law, and assented to keep it. God gave the law to show the pattern of life, the principles of righteousness, for the redeemed.\nOn one side of the coin is grace and on the other is law and obedience. They are harmonious; they cannot be separated. They are both vital parts of the process of sanctification leading to salvation. Grace is given upon repentance from sin, but after repentance, what is a Christian to do with his life? Obedience to God and living a life of holiness become his first priorities, and these work to produce character in the image of God (II Corinthians 3:18).\nAmos 5:25 reconfirms that the sacrifice, offering, and shedding of blood is a foundational necessity for a relationship with God. \"Did you offer Me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?\" The answer is, \"Yes.\" The people were sacrificing, but is that all that they did? He implies that though they were sacrificing, something was missing\u2014obedience to the law.\nGod told Israel that He would dwell in the Tabernacle, specifically the Holy of Holies, the symbolism of which we need to understand. The most important piece of furniture inside the Holy of Holies was the Mercy Seat, a wooden chest overlaid with gold. Its lid functioned as the seat. Inside the chest, under the seat, were stored the two tablets of stone, symbolizing God sitting on His law, the basis of His judgment.\nWhen one sins, he begins to separate himself from fellowship with God (Isaiah 59:1-2). He is no longer permitted, as it were, to come into the Holy of Holies. What means did God provide to heal the broken relationship, to restore the fellowship?\nOne might think that the giving of a sin offering would appease God, and He would forgive the sin. However, Hebrews 10:4 is very clear: \"For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats could take away sins.\" Then why did God have the Israelites make these sacrifices? \"But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year\" (verse 3). As Amos does not mention the sin offering in Amos 5:22, it seems that Israel did not even make the attempt to be reminded of sin.\nSo how was fellowship restored? On the Day of Atonement, once a year, the high priest entered the Holy of Holies to sprinkle the Mercy Seat with blood. God's intent in this ritual was to show people that their transgressions of His law were covered by the blood. The redeemed were again in fellowship with God.\nThe blood and the law are essential parts for maintaining the correct relationship with God. The law is permanent and codifies the nature of God in precepts to help us understand Him clearly. Obedience to His law is a perpetual requirement, with blood available to cover any transgression of it.","id":"<urn:uuid:b9619109-5f2f-4a84-aeb7-ac36b882068f>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.theberean.org\/index.cfm\/fuseaction\/Home.showBerean\/BereanID\/2024\/bblver\/ASV\/Amos-5-25.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9785506725,"token_count":751,"score":3.203125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"On February 1st, the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the \u201cConvention\u201d) announced the pledges made by countries under the Copenhagen Accord (the \u201cAccord\u201d). Developed country parties to the Accord pledged greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets to be achieved by 2020. Most notably, developing country parties to the Accord also pledged mitigation actions. By the January 31st deadline, pledges had been provided by countries representing approximately 80% of global GHG emissions.\npledges made under the Accord\nAdhering to legislation passed in its House of Representatives, the U.S. pledged a 17% reduction from 2005 levels.1 Canada also pledged a 17% reduction from 2005 levels, \u201cto be aligned with the final economy-wide emissions target of the United States in enacted legislation.\u201d2 Like Canada, many parties made pledges contingent on action by others. The European Union, for example, pledged to reduce its emissions 20% below 1990 levels, or by 30% should other parties make comparable commitments.\nAs an example of a mitigation action pledge of a developing country, China pledged to lower its carbon intensity (per unit GDP) by 40-45% by 2020, to increase to 15% the share of non-fossil fuels used in primary energy consumption, and to increase its forest coverage and forest stock volume.3 In comments following the announcement of the pledges, U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change, Todd Stern has made it clear that the U.S. expects of developing countries, stronger mitigation actions than those contained in the Accord.4\nthe 2009 UN climate change conference\nThe Accord was the outcome of the fifteenth Conference of the Parties (the \u201cConference\u201d) to the Convention,5 attended by yours truly. In an unprecedented display of the prominence that climate change is gaining on the world stage, the Conference was attended by 115 heads of state and over 40,000 delegates.\nThe stage that was the Conference was not without its share of theatrics. When the leaders arrived in the final days to find that little progress had been made, the drama moved behind the scenes. In a telling moment, frustrated by negotiating only with Chinese Premier Wen\u2019s aides, U.S. President Obama walked in on a private meeting between Wen and the leaders of Brazil, India, and South Africa.6 It was largely these five major economies that would go on to produce the Accord, which calls for any global temperature increase to be limited to two degrees Celsius.7\nHowever the parties to the Convention\u2019s Kyoto Protocol (the \u201cProtocol\u201d), the first commitment period of which ends in 2012, were unable to agree to its extension. The lack of consensus leaves in suspension the status of the Protocol\u2019s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and the value of the Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs) generated by thousands of projects thereunder. The International Emissions Trading Association (IETA), which held a parallel conference, nevertheless remains optimistic: \u201can international injection of increased demand remains a strong possibility over investment timescales but still has to be treated as an upside rather than a given.\u201d8\nback on the home front\nAs mentioned above, Canada\u2019s climate change policy is explicitly tied to that of the United States. 2009 saw in the U.S. the passage in the House of Representatives of the American Clean Energy and Security Act (\u201cWaxman-Markey\u201d). Waxman-Markey calls for a 17% reduction of emissions below 2005 levels by 2020 and provides for the trading of allowances.9 Debate in the U.S. Senate of the similar Kerry-Boxer bill is nominally scheduled for debate this spring, though it may be 2011 before it comes to a floor vote. Tri-partisan senators John Kerry (D), Lindsey Graham (R) and Joe Lieberman (I) have taken it upon themselves to ensure passage of a climate (or \u201cenergy independence\u201d) bill.\nFor many U.S. senators, any climate legislation must be accompanied by developing country emissions reductions and the international verification thereof. As China and others are less keen on international monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV), the Accord features compromise language. Countries will communicate their actions \u201cwith provisions for international consultations and analysis under clearly defined guidelines that will ensure national sovereignty is respected.\u201d10 In any case, with more than two thirds of Americans supporting the regulation of GHG emissions,11 the passage of legislation through Congress and, consequently, Canadian federal regulation, may be on the horizon.\nInternational climate change negotiations will occur in a number of fora this year. While the sixteenth Conference of the Parties will occur in December in Cancun, one might now wonder how much can be expected of 192-party negotiations. In June, Canada will host the G8 and G20 summits, and it is rumoured that climate change policy may be included on the agenda.12 Finally, it is likely that a second meeting of the Major Economies Forum will occur later this year to discuss climate policy.13","id":"<urn:uuid:7a4001a3-a36b-492a-9b85-d3408119e643>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.lexology.com\/library\/detail.aspx?g=7a718b20-b3df-42cc-a2bf-e2dc617af9ef","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9496594667,"token_count":1055,"score":3.109375,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Conference underscores young people\u2019s leadership in HIV prevention\n27 August 2010\nThe role of young people in improving the state of the world took centre stage at this week\u2019s World Youth Conference in Leon, Mexico. Over five days, delegates from 112 countries\u2014including 25 000 youth and representatives from government, civil society and the United Nations\u2014shared ideas on young people\u2019s involvement in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).\nWith an estimated 40% of new HIV infections occurring among people aged 15-24, a youth-centered approach to the AIDS response will be critical to meet MDG 6\u2014halting and reversing the spread of HIV\u2014and to ensure efforts are sustained in the long term.\nIn a video message to young delegates, UNAIDS Executive Director Michel Sidib\u00e9 said that young people had the power to shape a future with zero new infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths. \u201cEach of you is a driving force for change and development in your own countries,\u201d he said. \u201cTogether you are an incredible movement that is shaping the future of the world.\u201d\nOf the 33.4 million people living with HIV worldwide, some 5 million are young people. An estimated 2500 young people become newly infected with HIV each day. The epidemic has taken a particularly devastating toll on the lives of young women, who account for 66% of infections among youth worldwide.\nEmpowering young people to protect themselves from HIV represents one of UNAIDS\u2019 ten priority areas, with the overall goal of a 30% reduction in new HIV infections by 2015.\nAt a joint workshop on HIV and young people, UNAIDS and UNFPA introduced a new \u201cbusiness case\u201d outlining successes to date in the HIV response among youth and areas for improvement. Through the workshop, young delegates were invited to offer their perspectives on the relevance and application of the business case at the national level. Evidence-based information and HIV services, including sexual and reproductive health, were highlighted as critical to reducing infection among young people. Many participants voiced concern over reaching young people with effective HIV prevention messages.\n\u201cAs we are still young and exploring, we may get into risky behaviors,\u201d said Rodriguez Gastelum, a youth participant from Mexico who attended the workshop. \u201cCorrect information on HIV is the first step\u2014that will protect us.\u201d\nLess than 40% of young men and women have access to accurate knowledge about HIV transmission\u2014far short of the 95% target set in the UNGASS Declaration of Commitment for the year 2010. In developing countries, excluding China, only 30% of young men and 19% of young women benefit from comprehensive information on HIV.\nDespite challenges, there are signs of progress. A new study from UNAIDS has reported a more than 25% drop in HIV prevalence among young people in 15 countries heavily affected by the AIDS epidemic.\n\u201cSimply put, young people are leading a prevention revolution all over the globe,\u201d said Dr. C\u00e9sar Nunez, Director of the UNAIDS Regional Support Team for Latin America, in a health-focused session at the conference. \u201cThe empowerment of young people has led to changes in sexual behavior. Young people are choosing to have sex later, with fewer partners, and they are using condoms.\u201d\nEarlier this month, the UN launched the International Year of Youth, an initiative designed to increase youth participation in global development issues and enhance inter-cultural dialogue and understanding across generations. At a launch event in New York City, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged young people across the world to look beyond the borders of their own countries: \u201cEngage with the world. Become a global citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are the leaders of today.

{"text":"Coyotes spend a good deal of their day sleeping. Members of a pack or family may sleep within close proximity of each other, or they may sleep much further apart, but probably within the same couple of acres of each other. They have amazing built-in time clocks, but they also are influenced by circumstances of the moment. My own dog could tell the time and knew what was to be done at that time. For example, I always set off, with my dog, at exactly 2:40 to pick up one of my kids at school. But one day I fell asleep \u2014 I would not have made it on time except that my dog began poking me with her muzzle at exactly 2:40. Needless to say, I was amazed. The same is true for coyotes \u2014 they seem to know when it is time to meet up, but if people or dogs are around, they will delay.\nMost coyotes I know like to go trekking alone. After all, their staple diet consists of voles and gophers \u2014 animals that really can\u2019t be divvied up very well. Might as well hunt alone. But some coyotes do enjoy trekking together, usually in pairs. When they hunt in pairs, there is usually a rendezvous beforehand.\nRendezvous locations can remain the same for a while, or they can change drastically from day to day, but coyotes seem to have various favorite meeting spots which they alternate between for a while, before changing these altogether . This is where they congregate to then move together for their foraging.\nIn this case here, the older female had spent her day sleeping in the sun quite some distance from where the young male had been also sleeping in the sun. The female was the first to move around \u2014 she disappeared into some bushes. In the meantime, I watched the male who moved from where he had been sleeping to a new location where he curled up and then dozed a while longer. Finally, he got up, stretched, scratched, and began to forage. I watched him catch a vole and toy with it. He continued searching for voles and then looked up ahead. He must have seen the female approaching, because he sat down and watched intently. She trotted over, and arrived on the scene.\nThe ritual began with hugs and kisses. They are hidden in the grass in these photos, but you can see what is going on. It was intense, but lasted only about a minute. That was the first phase of the meeting. Then there was a pause where all activity ceased. I think the male was waiting for something, but since nothing happened he turned around and backed into her \u2014 it looked like a request. He did it again and then looked over his shoulder: \u201cwell?\u201d. The older female was obliging. She began grooming the young fellow, pulling off burrs and bugs.

{"text":"You wouldn\u2019t guess that a bit of green slime could do so much. But from from food to fuel, PetroAlgae, Inc. seems to have thought of everything. This Florida-based renewable energy company has developed a technology in which algae and other microorganisms produce fuel to feed cars, animals, and even humans...and say they can do it cheaper than anyone else.\nWith the addition of a few basic nutrients, algae gather most of their energy from the sun. The result is a protein and carbohydrate-rich slime that can be converted to a variety of products. First, the protein is extracted and processed into animal feed or blended into human food products. PetroAlgae actually lists one of its products as \u201cmeal replacer\u201d, conjuring images of our new utopian future in which chewing is obsolete.\nAfter the protein extraction, what remains is a \u201clipid-carbohydrate mash\u201d. PetroAlgae claims that this material can be sent directly to a petroleum refinery and processed into diesel, gas, or jet fuel without the need to retro-fit any of the refinery\u2019s conventional equipment. Algae cultivation requires very little square-footage relative to conventional crops, can be grown on non-arable land, and consumes up to twice its weight in carbon dioxide as it grows.\nIn addition to algae, PetroAlgae draws from a large pool of microorganisms including diatoms, cyanobacteria, and micro-angiosperms (tiny flowering plants). While exact species remain unnamed, the company conscientiously notes that they use only species indigenous to the region in which a production facility will be installed. They have already begun licensing their technology to commercial facilities in Asia, and are poised to complete contracts with the U.S. and several European countries this year. Each licensee is promised the potential to produce 1.5 million barrels of transportation fuel per year, or the equivalent of 1.4 billion miles for a single truck. If PetroAlgae\u2019s assertions hold true, the cost of fuel production is essentially paid for by the revenue from food and feed products, meaning that their microbe-derived fuels will remain competitive with fossil fuels, at any price.\nPetroAlgae is in the business of licensing its technology rather than building the algae plants itself. It already has deals with algae farms in India and China and is currently working on deals in the U.S., Canada and Europe.\nVia BioFuels Digest\nwritten by Fred, July 14, 2009\nwritten by OakleighVermont solargroupies, July 14, 2009\nwritten by Andrew, July 15, 2009\nwritten by Sri Sadika, July 16, 2009\nwritten by Fred, July 31, 2009\n|< Prev||Next >|","id":"<urn:uuid:235c3761-1dbf-4b3f-b89f-5074a6be7e73>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/ecogeek.org\/component\/content\/article\/2855-petroalgae-promises-fuel-and-food-from-a-single-re","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9583628178,"token_count":568,"score":3.15625,"int_score":3}

{"text":"A study released this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may have the weary thinking about getting some rest before they get behind the wheel. The study found that one in 24 U.S. adults said they recently fell asleep while driving.\nThe National Highway Safety Administration estimates 2.5 percent of fatal motor vehicle crashes (about 730 in 2009) and 2 percent of all crashes with non-fatal injuries (about 30,000 in 2009) involved drowsy driving, according to the CDC.\n\u201cHowever, although data collection methods make it challenging to estimate the number of crashes that involve drowsy drivers, some modeling studies have estimated that 15 to 33 percent of fatal crashes might involve drowsy drivers,\u201d the report stated.\nIn the study, about 4 percent of U.S. adults said they nodded off or fell asleep at least once while driving in the previous month. The study surveyed 147,000 people in 19 states by telephone in 2009 and 2010.\nResearchers found that drowsy driving was more common among people ages 25 to 34, adults who reported usually sleeping six hours or less per day, snoring or unintentionally falling asleep during the day.\nSteve Deibel, owner and founder of Aiken Driving Academy, said that a section of his classes address fatigued driving. He shows students a video on a New Jersey law known as \u201cMaggie\u2019s Law.\u201d\nThe law was enacted following an accident in 1997, during which college student Maggie McDonnell was killed in a car accident when struck by a van driven by someone who had not slept for 30 hours and had also been using drugs. The driver fell asleep at the wheel when the accident occurred.\nAfter two trials, the driver of the van was given a $200 fine and a suspended jail sentence. The law defines fatigue as being without sleep for more than 24 consecutive hours and makes driving while fatigued a criminal offense.\n\u201cWe show that video and talk to our young people about fatigue,\u201d Deibel said. \u201cThey\u2019re tired because they stay up late. They get six or eight hours of sleep at night but need 10 to 12.\u201d\nDeibel, a former law enforcement officer, said there have been fatalities in Aiken County related to fatigued driving.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very overlooked, and it\u2019s very serious,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have rest. You can\u2019t be on the road when you\u2019re tired or fatigued.\u201d\nDeibel said the video also followed a news reporter that was kept awake for 30 hours as part of an experiment. He then was hooked up to monitoring machines and drove a car on a closed course.\n\u201cWhat came of the study \u2013 you fall asleep but your eyes are open,\u201d Deibel said. \u201cOur bodies are built to shut down. If you have somebody that\u2019s fatigued behind the wheel and they\u2019re essentially asleep, you might as well just blindfold them.\u201d\nDeibel said falling asleep at the wheel is as dangerous as driving 2.5 times the legal blood-alcohol limit.\n\u201cI hate making those correlations, because impaired driving is extremely dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you have to lump fatigued driving into all the serious dangers of driving. You can\u2019t look at it as, \u2018I\u2019m sleepy. I\u2019ll just get some coffee.\u2019\u201d\nIf you feel fatigued while driving, Deibel suggests pulling over, getting out of the vehicle and getting something to eat, especially if you find yourself rubbing your eyes, rolling down the window, turning on the air conditioner or doing other things to keep yourself awake.\n\u201cIf you start doing things to stay awake, you need to stop and look at your sleep cycle,\u201d he said, adding that if the last time you slept was more than 18 to 20 hours, you don\u2019t need to be driving.\nHe added that fatigued driving, as opposed to \u201ctired driving,\u201d usually occurs after being awake for 18 hours or more.\nIf you\u2019ve been awake 18 hours or more, \u201cyou need to start looking very hard at where you\u2019re driving, when you\u2019re driving and if you need to be driving,\u201d Deibel said. He added that caffeine is only a temporary fix in some cases.\n\u201cHow much caffeine does it take to keep somebody awake who\u2019s been awake for 20-plus hours?\u201d he said. \u201cIt eventually wouldn\u2019t, because your body is just going to shut down.\u201d\nTeddy Kulmala covers the crime beat for the Aiken Standard.

At the beginning of World War II, the ship was initially deployed to blockade the Polish coast, but she was quickly transferred to the German Bight to lay minefields in German waters. In late 1939 the ship made one successful minelaying sortie off the English coast that claimed one British warship and seven merchant ships. During the early stages of the Norwegian Campaign, Bernd von Arnim fought the British destroyer Glowworm while transporting troops to the Narvik area in early April 1940, but neither ship was damaged during the action. The ship fought in both naval Battles of Narvik several days later and had to be scuttled after she exhausted her ammunition.\nDesign and description \nBernd von Arnim had an overall length of 119 meters (390 ft 5 in) and was 114 meters (374 ft 0 in) long at the waterline. The ship had a beam of 11.3 meters (37 ft 1 in), and a maximum draft of 4.23 meters (13 ft 11 in). She displaced 2,171 long tons (2,206 t) at standard load and 3,190 long tons (3,240 t) at deep load. The Wagner geared steam turbines were designed to produce 70,000 shaft horsepower (52,199 kW) which would propel the ship at 36 knots (67 km\/h; 41 mph). Steam was provided to the turbines by six high-pressure Benson boilers with superheaters. Bernd von Arnim carried a maximum of 752 metric tons (740 long tons) of fuel oil which was intended to give a range of 4,400 nautical miles (8,100 km; 5,100 mi) at 19 knots (35 km\/h; 22 mph), but the ship proved top-heavy in service and 30% of the fuel had to be retained as ballast low in the ship. The effective range proved to be only 1,530 nmi (2,830 km; 1,760 mi) at 19 knots (35 km\/h; 22 mph).\nBernd von Arnim carried five 12.7 cm SK C\/34 guns in single mounts with gun shields, two each superimposed, fore and aft. The fifth gun was carried on top of the rear deckhouse. Her anti-aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 cm SK C\/30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and six 2 cm C\/30 guns in single mounts. The ship carried eight above-water 53.3-centimeter (21.0 in) torpedo tubes in two power-operated mounts. Four depth charge throwers were mounted on the sides of the rear deckhouse and they were supplemented by six racks for individual depth charges on the sides of the stern. Enough depth charges were carried for either two or four patterns of 16 charges each. Mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. 'GHG' (Gruppenhorchger\u00e4t) passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines.\nThe ship was ordered on 4 August 1934 and laid down at Germania, Kiel on 26 March 1935 as yard number G537. She was launched on 8 July 1936 and completed on 6 July 1938. When World War II began in September 1939, Bernd von Arnim was initially deployed in the Baltic to operate against the Polish Navy and to enforce a blockade of Poland, but she was soon transferred to the German Bight where she joined her sisters in laying defensive minefields. The ship also patrolled the Skagerrak to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods. Bernd von Arnim joined the other destroyers in laying minefields off the British coast in November, when Bernd von Arnim, Hermann K\u00fcnne and Wilhelm Heidkamp laid about 180 magnetic mines in the middle of the Thames Estuary on the night of 17\/18 November. The destroyer HMS Gipsy, one trawler, and seven other ships totalling 27,565 Gross Register Tons (GRT) were sunk by this minefield. Four days later, she was one of the destroyers escorting the battleships Gneisenau and Scharnhorst through the North Sea to break out into the North Atlantic. Together with her sisters Hans Lody and Erich Giese, Bernd von Arnim was to lay a minefield off Cromer during the night of 6\/7 December, but she had trouble with two of her boilers and had to shut them down. The ship was ordered to return to port while the other two destroyers continued their mission.\nNorwegian Campaign \nBernd von Arnim was allocated to Group 1 for the Norwegian portion of Operation Weser\u00fcbung in April 1940. The group's task was to transport the 139th Mountain Infantry Regiment (139. Gebirgsj\u00e4ger Regiment) and the headquarters of the 3rd Mountain Division (3. Gebirgs-Division) to seize Narvik. The ships began loading troops on 6 April and set sail the next day. Bernd von Arnim was spotted by the British destroyer Glowworm in a storm on the morning of 8 April and the ship turned away to the north-west at full speed after laying a smoke screen. The German ship was suffering damage from the heavy seas at 35 knots (65 km\/h; 40 mph) and was forced to reduce speed to 27 knots (50 km\/h; 31 mph) after she had lost two men overboard. The British destroyer was better suited for the conditions and began to close on Bernd von Arnim. Lieutenant Commander (Korvettenkapit\u00e4n) Curt Rechel, captain of von Arnim, turned his ship to the north-east, closer to the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper. The ships exchanged fire without effect for an hour until Hipper came within range and sank Glowworm shortly afterward.\nThe German destroyers reached the Ofotfjord on the morning of 9 April and Commodore Friedrich Bonte took his flagship Wilhelm Heidkamp, Bernd von Arnim and Georg Thiele down the fjord to Narvik. A heavy snowstorm allowed von Arnim and Thiele to enter the harbor without challenge and tie up at a pier. The mountain troops immediately began disembarking, but the ship was spotted by the coast defense ship Norge a few minutes later. The latter ship immediately opened fire and was able to fire approximately 13 shells at 600\u2013800 meters (660\u2013870 yd) range before von Arnim was able to fire seven torpedoes. Only two struck the Norwegian ship, but they detonated one or more of the ship's magazines and she immediately capsized and sank. None of the Norwegian shells hit either of the two German destroyers due to the darkness and falling snow, despite the short range. Von Arnim lowered boats to rescue the surviving Norwegian sailors and was able to pick up 96 men together with boats from the merchantmen in harbor.\nVon Arnim and Thiele were the first to refuel from the single tanker that had made it safely to Narvik and later moved to the Ballangenfjord, a southern arm of the Ofotfjord, closer to the entrance. Shortly before dawn on 10 April, the five destroyers of the British 2nd Destroyer Flotilla surprised the five German destroyers in Narvik harbor. They torpedoed two destroyers and badly damaged the other three while suffering only minor damage themselves. As they were beginning to withdraw they encountered the three destroyers of the 4th Flotilla which had been alerted in the Herjansfjord when the British began their attack. The Germans opened fire first, but the gunnery for both sides was not effective due to the mist and the smoke screen laid by the British as they retreated down the Ofotfjord. The German ships had to turn away to avoid a salvo of three torpedoes fired by one of the destroyers in Narvik, but von Arnim and Thiele had also been alerted and were coming up to engage the British.\nThe two German destroyers crossed the T of the British flotilla and were able to fire full broadsides at a range of only 4,000 meters (13,000 ft). They first engaged the British flagship, HMS Hardy, and badly damaged her. Both of her forward guns were knocked out and the forward superstructure was set afire. Hardy was forced to beach herself lest she sink, and the German ships switched their fire to HMS Havock, the next ship in line. Their fire was relatively ineffective and both sides fired torpedoes without scoring any hits. Havock pulled out and dropped to the rear to fight off any pursuit by the ships of the 4th Flotilla. This placed HMS Hunter in the lead and she was quickly set on fire by the German ships. Thiele probably also hit her with a torpedo and she was rammed from behind by HMS Hotspur when the latter ship lost steering control. Hotspur was able to disengage, but Hunter capsized shortly afterward. The three remaining British ships were able to escape from the Germans under the cover of a smoke screen. Von Arnim had been hit by five British shells, which had knocked out one boiler. This was repaired by the morning of 13 April and she received six torpedoes from the badly damaged destroyers.\nOn the night of 12 April, Commander Erich Bey, the senior surviving German officer, received word to expect an attack the following day by British capital ships escorted by a large number of destroyers and supported by carrier aircraft. The battleship Warspite and nine destroyers duly appeared on 13 April, although earlier than Commander Bey had expected, and caught the Germans out of position. The five operable destroyers, including Bernd von Arnim, charged out of Narvik harbor and engaged the British ships. Although no hits were scored, they did inflict splinter damage on several of the destroyers. The ship was able to make a torpedo attack on the British destroyers before being driven off, but her torpedoes all missed. Lack of ammunition forced the German ships to retreat to the Rombaksfjorden (the easternmost branch of the Ofotfjord), east of Narvik, where they might attempt to ambush pursuing British destroyers. Von Arnim had exhausted her ammunition and she was beached at the head of the fjord. Her crew placed demolition charges and abandoned the ship. By the time the British reached the ship she had rolled over onto her side. The ship's crew joined the German troops ashore and participated in the campaign until the British evacuated the area in June.\n- Groener, p. 199\n- Whitley, p. 18\n- Koop and Schmolke, p. 26\n- Whitley, p. 215\n- Whitley, pp. 71\u201372\n- Whitley, p. 204\n- Koop and Schmolke, p. 91\n- Rohwer, pp. 2\u20133, 5, 7\n- Rohwer, p. 9\n- Whitley, p. 89\n- Hervieux, p. 112\n- Whitley, pp. 89\u201390\n- Whitley, p. 96\n- Haarr, pp. 91\u201393\n- Haarr, p. 323\n- Haarr, pp. 327\n- Haarr, p. 334\n- Whitley, p. 99\n- Harr, pp. 339\u201343\n- Haarr, pp. 344\u201347\n- Whitley, p. 101\n- Haarr, pp. 356\u201357, 362, 366\n- Whitley, p. 103\n- Haarr, pp. 368, 373\u201374\n- Gr\u00f6ner, Erich (1990).

{"text":"By Julie Steenhuysen\nCHICAGO (Reuters) - In the latest installment in the mammogram debate, a new study finds that getting a mammogram every other year instead of annually did not increase the risk of advanced breast cancer in women aged 50 to 74, even in women who use hormone therapy or have dense breasts, factors that increase a woman's cancer risk.\nThe findings, released on Monday by researchers at the University California, San Francisco, support the conclusions of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an influential government panel of health advisers, which in 2009 issued guidelines that said women should have mammograms every other year starting at age 50 rather than annual tests starting at age 40.\nThe controversial recommendations to reduce the frequency and delay the start of mammogram screening were based on studies suggesting the benefits of detecting cancers earlier did not outweigh the risk of false positive results, which needlessly expose women to the anguish of a breast cancer diagnosis and the ordeal of treatment.\nThe matter, however, is not settled. The American Cancer Society still recommends women be screened for breast cancer every year they are in good health starting at age 40, but the group is closely watching studies such as this.\n\"I don't think any one study ought to change everything,\" Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, said in a telephone interview. But he added, \"This is one of several studies that are all pointing in the same direction over the last several years.\"\nBrawley said he did not expect screening recommendations from professional organizations to change in the next year, but he does see doctors moving toward a more personalized approach over the next five years. There may be some women who need to be screened every six months and others every two years depending on their breast density, family history and genetic testing.\nIn the latest study, Dr. Karla Kerlikowske of the University of California, San Francisco, and colleagues wanted to see whether risk factors beyond a woman's age play a role in the decision of when to start mammogram screening.\nIn addition to age, the team considered whether women had dense breast tissue - which has a higher ratio of connective tissue to fat - or took combination estrogen and progesterone hormone therapy for more than five years, both of which can increase the risk of breast cancer.\n\"If you have these risk factors, would it help if you got screened annually vs. every two years?\" said Kerlikowske, whose study was published online in JAMA Internal Medicine.\nTo study this, the team analyzed data from 11,474 women with breast cancer and 922,624 without breast cancer gathered from 1994 to 2008. Even after looking at these other factors, the team found no increased risk of advanced cancer in women 50 to 74 who got a mammogram every other year instead of every year.\n\"It didn't matter whether you screened that group every year or every two years, the risk of advanced disease or having a worse tumor was no different,\" Kerlikowske said.\nMore frequent screening in these women did result in more false-positive results. Women aged 50 to 74 who had annual mammograms had a 50 percent risk of having a false-positive result over a 10-year period, but a 31 percent risk when they were screened every other year.\nStudies suggest a false positive can have lasting psychological effects. A March study in the Annals of Family Medicine said, \"Three years after a false-positive \ufb01nding, women experience psychosocial consequences that range between those experienced by women with a normal mammogram and those with a diagnosis of breast cancer.\"\nBreast density was a factor in younger women, however. When the team looked at screening frequency in women 40 to 49, they found those with extremely dense breasts who were screened every other year had a higher risk of having a more advanced cancer than those who got screened every year. Younger women also were far more likely to have false-positive results and undergo unnecessary procedures.\nWithout getting a mammogram in their 40s, Kerlikowske said, \"women aren't going to know if they have extremely dense breasts.\"\nAmong women in their 40s, about 12 percent to 15 percent have extremely dense breast tissue. For these women, Kerlikowske said she recommends that they get a mammogram if they have other risk factors that might put her at risk of breast cancer, including having a first-degree relative that a common term, or just \"close relative\"? such as a mother or a sister with breast cancer.\n\"Once we see their breast density is high, we will offer annual mammography,\" she said.\nThe American College of Radiology and the Society of Breast Imaging, groups that represent radiologists, said the study's methodology was flawed because it used early and late breast cancers to determine the outcomes of breast screening rather than more refined measures of tumor size, nodal status and cancer stage, which could determine whether screening detected cancers at an earlier stage.\nIt also faulted the study for not being a closely controlled, randomized clinical trial. The study used data from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium, a national mammography screening database that gathers information from community mammography clinics on millions of women.\n\"We're never going to have a randomized study. This is the best in terms of the type of study anyone can actually hope for,\" said Brawley, whose group monitors scores of breast studies from around the world each year. He said such a study would take decades and would be prohibitively expensive.\nCatching cancers earlier does not always translate into lives saved, according to a November study published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Dr. Gilbert Welch of the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy & Clinical Practice in New Hampshire.\nThat study suggested that as many as a third of cancers detected through routine mammograms may not be life-threatening, contradicting the deeply ingrained belief that cancer screening is always good.\nKerlikowske said the strength of her study is that it allows researchers to consider other risk factors, such as breast density, allowing doctors to offer women personalized choices about when to start breast cancer screening.\n\"We're trying to move it away from this idea that it all should be based on age. There should be some thoughtfulness to it,\" she said.\n(Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Additional reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Jilian Mincer and Douglas Royalty)","id":"<urn:uuid:07a59dc4-01d9-4277-b867-90979646b6ea>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/kelofm.com\/news\/articles\/2013\/mar\/19\/less-frequent-mammograms-dont-increase-risks-after-age-50-study\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.970928371,"token_count":1328,"score":2.59375,"int_score":3}

{"text":"The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft is expected to discover its 1,000TH comet this summer.\nThe SOHO spacecraft is a joint effort between NASA and the European Space Agency. It has accounted for approximately one-half of all comet discoveries with computed orbits in the history of astronomy.\n\"Before SOHO was launched, only 16 sun grazing comets had been discovered by space observatories. Based on that experience, who could have predicted SOHO would discover more than 60 times that number, and in only nine years,\" said Dr. Chris St. Cyr. He is senior project scientist for NASA's Living With a Star program at the agency's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. \"This is truly a remarkable achievement!\"\nAbout 85 percent of the comets SOHO discovered belongs to the Kreutz group of sun grazing comets, so named because their orbits take them very close to Earth's star. The Kreutz sun grazers pass within 500,000 miles of the star's visible surface. Mercury, the planet closest to the sun, is about 36 million miles from the solar surface.\nSOHO has also been used to discover three other well-populated comet groups: the Meyer, with at least 55 members; Marsden, with at least 21 members; and the Kracht, with 24 members. These groups are named after the astronomers who suggested the comets are related, because they have similar orbits.\nMany comet discoveries were made by amateurs using SOHO images on the Internet. SOHO comet hunters come from all over the world. The United States, United Kingdom, China, Japan, Taiwan, Russia, Ukraine, France, Germany, and Lithuania are among the many countries whose citizens have used SOHO to chase comets.\nAlmost all of SOHO's comets are discovered using images from its Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) instrument. LASCO is used to observe the faint, multimillion-degree outer atmosphere of the sun, called the corona. A disk in the instrument is used to make an artificial eclipse, blocking direct light from the sun, so the much fainter corona can be seen. Sun grazing comets are discovered when they enter LASCO's field of view as they pass close by the star.\n\"Building coronagraphs like LASCO is still more art than science, because the light we are trying to detect is very faint,\" said Dr. Joe Gurman, U.S. project scientist for SOHO at Goddard. \"Any imperfections in the optics or dust in the instrument will scatter the light, making the images too noisy to be useful. Discovering almost 1,000 comets since SOHO's launch on December 2, 1995 is a testament to the skill of the LASCO team.\"\nSOHO successfully completed its primary mission in April 1998.

{"text":"Is this bone a Neanderthal flute?\nCave Bear femur fragment from Slovenia, 43+kya\nDOUBTS AIRED OVER NEANDERTHAL BONE 'FLUTE'\n(AND REPLY BY MUSICOLOGIST BOB FINK)\nScience News 153 (April 4, 1998): 215.\nBy B. Bower\nAmid much media fanfare, a research team in 1996 trumpeted an ancient, hollowed out bear bone pierced on one side with four complete or partial holes as the earliest known musical instrument. The perforated bone, found in an Eastern European cave, represents a flute made and played by Neandertals at least 43,000 ye us ago, the scientists contended.\nNow it's time to stop the music, say two archaeologists who examined the purported flute last spring. On closer inspection, the bone appears to have been punctured and gnawed by the teeth of an animal -- perhaps a wolf -- as it stripped the limb of meat and marrow report, April Nowell and Philip G. Chase, both of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. \"The bone was heavily chewed by one or more carnivores, creating holes that became more rounded due to natural processes after burial,\" Nowell says. \"It provides very weak evidence for the origins of [Stone Age] music.\" Nowell presented the new analysis at the annual meeting of the Paleoanthropology Society in Seattle last week.\nNowell and Chase examined the bone with the permission of its discoverer, Ivan Turk of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences in Ljubljana (S.N.: 11\/23\/96, p. 328). Turk knows of their conclusion but still views the specimen as a flute.\nBoth open ends of the thighbone contain clear signs of gnawing by carnivores, Nowell asserts. Wolves and other animals typically bite off nutrient-rich tissue at the ends of limb bones and extract available marrow. If Neandertals had hollowed out the bone and fashioned holes in it, animals would not have bothered to gnaw it, she says.\nComplete and partial holes on the bone's shaft were also made by carnivores, says Nowell. Carnivores typically break open bones with their scissor like cheek teeth. Uneven bone thickness and signs of wear along the borders of the holes, products of extended burial in the soil, indicate that openings made by cheek teeth were at first less rounded and slightly smaller, the researchers hold.\nMoreover, the simultaneous pressure of an upper and lower tooth produced a set of opposing holes, one partial and one complete, they maintain.\nPrehistoric, carnivore-chewed bear bones in two Spanish caves display circular punctures aligned in much the same way as those on the Slovenian find. In the March Antiquity, Francesco d'Errico of the Institute of Quaternary Prehistory and Geology in Talence, France, and his colleagues describe the Spanish bones.\nIn a different twist, Bob Fink, an independent musicologist in Canada, has reported\non the Internet\n(http:\/\/www.webster.sk.ca\/greenwich\/fl-compl.htm) that the spacing of the two complete and two partial holes on the back of the Slovenian bone conforms to musical notes on the diatonic (do, re, mi. . .) scale.\nThe bone is too short to incorporate the diatonic scale's seven notes, counter Nowell and Chase. Working with Pennsylvania musicologist Robert Judd, they estimate that the find's 5.7-inch length is less than half that needed to cover the diatonic spectrum. The recent meeting presentation is \"a most convincing analysis,\" comments J. Desmond Clark of the University of California, Berkeley, although it's possible that Neandertals blew single notes through carnivore-chewed holes in the bone.\n\"We can't exclude that possibility,\" Nowell responds. \"But it's a big leap of faith to conclude that this was an intentionally constructed flute.\"\nTO THE EDITOR, SCIENCE NEWS (REPLY BY BOB FINK, May 1998)\n(See an update of this discussion on Bob Fink's web site, November 2000)\nThe doubts raised by Nowell and Chase (April 4th, DOUBTS AIRED OVER NEANDERTHAL BONE 'FLUTE') saying the Neanderthal Bone is not a flute have these weaknesses:\nThe alignment of the holes -- all in a row, and all of equivalent diameter, appear to be contrary to most teeth marks, unless some holes were made independently by several animals. The latter case boggles the odds for the holes ending up being in line. It also would be strange that animals homed in on this one bone in a cave full of bones, where no reports of similarly chewed bones have been made.\nThis claim is harder to believe when it is calculated that chances for holes to\nbe arranged, by chance, in a pattern that matches the spacings of 4 notes of a\ndiatonic flute, are only one in hundreds to occur .\nThe analysis I made on the Internet (http:\/\/www.webster.sk.ca\/greenwich\/fl-compl.htm) regarding the bone being capable of matching 4 notes of the do, re, mi (diatonic) scale included the possibility that the bone was extended with another bone \"mouthpiece\" sufficiently long to make the notes sound fairly in tune. While Nowell says \"it's a big leap of faith to conclude that this was an intentionally constructed flute,\" it's a bigger leap of faith to accept the immense coincidence that animals blindly created a hole-spacing pattern with holes all in line (in what clearly looks like so many other known bone flutes which are made to play notes in a step-wise scale) and blindly create a pattern that also could play a known acoustic scale if the bone was extended. That's too much coincidence for me to accept. It is more likely that it is an intentionally made flute, although admittedly with only the barest of clues regarding its original condition.\nThe 5.7 inch figure your article quoted appears erroneous, as the centimeter scale provided by its discoverer, Ivan Turk, indicates the artifact is about 4.3 inches long. However, the unbroken femur would originally have been about 8.5 inches, and the possibility of an additional hole or two exists, to complete a full scale, perhaps aided by the possible thumbhole. However, the full diatonic spectrum is not required as indicated by Nowell and Chase: It could also have been a simpler (but still diatonic) 4 or 5 note scale. Such short-scale flutes are plentiful in homo sapiens history.\nFinally, a worn-out or broken flute bone can serve as a scoop for manipulation of food, explaining why animals might chew on its ends later. It is also well-known that dogs chase and maul even sticks, despite their non-nutritional nature. What appears \"weak\" is not the case for a flute, but the case against it by Nowell and Chase.\nLetter to the Editor: Antiquity Journal:\n\"A Bone to Pick\"\nBy Bob Fink\nI have a bone to pick with Francesco d'Errico's viewpoint in the March issue of Antiquity (article too long to reproduce here) regarding the Neanderthal flute found in Slovenia by Ivan Turk. D'Errico argues the bone artifact is not a flute.\nD'Errico omits dealing with the best evidence that this bone find is a flute.\nRegarding the most important evidence, that of the holes being lined up, neither d'Errico nor Turk make mention of this.\nThis line-up is remarkable especially if they were made by more than one carnivore, which apparently they'd have to be, based on Turk's analysis of the center-spans of the holes precluding their being made by a single carnivore or bite (Turk,* pp.171-175). To account for this possible difficulty, some doubters do mention \"one or more\" carnivores (Chase & Nowell, Science News 4\/4\/98).\nMy arguments over the past year pointed out the mathematical odds of the lining up of the holes occurring by chance-chewing are too difficult to believe.\nThe Appendix in my essay (\"Neanderthal Flute --A Musicological Analysis\") proves that the number of ways a set of 4 random holes could be differently spaced (to produce an audibly different set of tones) are 680 ways. The chances a random set would match the existing fragment's spacing [which also could produce a match to four diatonic notes of the scale] are therefore only one in hundreds. If, in calculating the odds, you also allowed the holes to be out of line, or to be less than 4 holes as well, then the chance of a line-up match is only one from many tens of thousands.\nAnd yet randomness and animal bites still are acceptable to account for holes being in line that could also play some notes of the scale? This is too much coincidence for me to believe occurred by chance.\nD'Errico mentions my essay in his article and what he thought it was about, but he overstates my case into being a less believable one. My case simply was that if the bone was long enough (or a shorter bone extended by a mouthpiece insert) then the 4 holes would be consistent and in tune with the sounds of Do, Re, Mi, Fa (or flat Mi, Fa, Sol, and flat La in a minor scale).\nIn the 5 points I list below, extracted from Turk's monograph in support of this being a flute, d'Errico omits dealing with much of the first, and all of the second, fourth and sixth points.\nTurk & Co's monograph shows the presence on site of boring tools, and includes experiments made by Turk's colleague Guiliano Bastiani who successfully produced similar holes in fresh bone using tools of the type found at the site (pp. 176-78 Turk).\nThey also wrote (pp. 171-75) that:\n1. The center-to-center distances of the holes in the artifact are smaller than that of the tooth spans of most carnivores. The smallest tooth spans they found were 45mm, and the holes on the bone are 35mm (or less) apart;\n2. Holes bitten are usually at the ends of bones rather than in the center of them;\n3. There is an absence of dents, scratches and other signs of gnawing and counter-bites on the artifact;\n4. The center-to-center distances do not correspond to the spans of carnivores which could pierce the bone;\n5. The diameters of the holes are greater than that producible by a wolf exerting the greatest jaw pressure it had available -- it's doubtful that a wolf's jaws would be strong enough (like a hyena's) to have made the holes, especially in the thickest part of the wall of the artifact.\n6. If you accept one or more carnivores, then why did they over-target one bone, when there were so many other bones in the cave site? Only about 4.5% of the juvenile bones were chewed or had holes, according to Turk (p. 117).\n* Turk, Ivan (ed.) (1997). Mousterian Bone Flute.

Risky behavior in youth decreases: Results of the 2011 New Mexico Youth Risk and Resiliency Survey showed a significant decrease in the rates of the prevalence of suicide attempts, cigarette smoking and binge drinking among the state's public high school students. The YRRS is conducted in New Mexico public high schools and middle schools in the fall semester of odd numbered years. The 2011 YRRS surveyed 16,635 New Mexico high school students. According to the survey, suicide attempts were reported by 8.6 percent of high school students, down 40.7 percent from a high of 14.5 percent in 2003. The percentage of high school students who were current smokers declined from a high of 30.2 percent in 2003 to 19.9 percent in 2011. Binge drinking decreased from a rate of 35.4 percent in 2003 to 22.4 percent in 2011. For more information, including reports by New Mexico counties, go to www.youthrisk.org.\n4.

West Nile resurgence: West Nile Virus was once again in the national and State spotlight due to a resurgence in the number of human cases of the disease nationwide and in New Mexico. In 2012, there were 47 human cases, which included one death in Bernalillo County. In 2011 there were four human cases and in 2010 there were 25 cases. West Nile was first detected in 2003 in New Mexico, with 209 human cases. West Nile Virus prevention tips can be found online at www.nmhealth.org\/erd\/healthdata\/westnile.shtml.\n2. Prescription drug overdoses Increase: In May 2012, the Department released data that shows sales of controlled prescription opiate pain relievers increased 131 percent in New Mexico between 2001 and 2010. During the same period, the state's drug overdose death rate increased 61.8 percent. Since 2007, the overdose death rate from prescription drugs has exceeded the death rate from illicit drugs such as heroin and cocaine.\nThere is help available for people addicted to prescription medications.

This is compared to 277 cases in 2011, 151 cases in 2010 and just 85 cases in 2009. Pertussis is a vaccine-preventable disease that causes fits of coughing that in some people make it hard to breathe. Anyone can get pertussis, but babies who get the disease are at greatest risk of complications, including pneumonia, seizures, brain damage and death. The best prevention from stopping the spread of pertussis is to get vaccinated.

{"text":"Sheep & Wolf to join forces?\nBirdLife International and FACE (the Federation of Associations for Hunting and Conservation of the EU) have signed a historic agreement recognising that the conservation of bird species and their habitats is a common objective. Both organisations agree that the Birds Directive is the appropriate instrument for bird conservation in the European Union, and undertake not to attempt to change it. Both recognise the importance of the Natura 2000 network, which includes all the Special Protection Areas for birds required under the Birds Directive. They also agree to cooperate in promoting strategic conservation priorities, such as halting biodiversity decline by 2010, protecting sites, and reforming the Common Agricultural Policy.\nThe Agreement, signed on 12\nOctober by Mike Rands, Director and Chief Executive of BirdLife International and Gilbert de Turckheim, President of FACE, was\nwelcomed and countersigned by Mrs Margot Wallstr?m, Commissioner for the Environment. Progress towards this agreement began in 2001,\nwhen the European Commission launched the Sustainable Hunting Initiative (SHI) to create a constructive dialogue between\nconservationists and hunters, represented by BirdLife International and FACE.\nThe SHI was started at a time when the two organisations could be considered arch-enemies, and constant confrontations on hunting issues seemed to be leading nowhere, said Dr Clairie Papazoglou, BirdLife`s Head of EU Policy. This Agreement proves that reasonable hunters and reasonable conservationists can work together for the benefit of birds and people. It represents an important step forward in the relations of the two organisations, which on the basis of this text can chart a list of common actions, to be carried out in the years to come. It can also be the basis on which BirdLife`s Partners can promote similar initiatives at the national level.\nCreated: 5th Nov 2004","id":"<urn:uuid:67e8d8a9-0152-4e50-b52a-9991a3d8f3a7>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/fatbirder.com\/news\/index.php?article=419","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9365645051,"token_count":372,"score":2.625,"int_score":3}
{"text":"|The German inflation of 1923\n\u2014 one dollar worth trillions of marks.\n[This article is excerpted from the book The Age of Inflation, by Hans Sennholz.]\nThe German inflation of 1914\u20131923 had an inconspicuous beginning, a creeping rate of one to two percent. On the first day of the war, the German Reichsbank, like the other central banks of the belligerent powers, suspended redeemability of its notes in order to prevent a run on its gold reserves.\nLike all the other banks, it offered assistance to the central government in financing the war effort. Since taxes are always unpopular, the German government preferred to borrow the needed amounts of money rather than raise its taxes substantially. To this end it was readily assisted by the Reichsbank, which discounted most treasury obligations.\nA growing percentage of government debt thus found its way into the vaults of the central bank and an equivalent amount of printing press money into people\u2019s cash holdings. In short, the central bank was monetizing the growing government debt.\nBy the end of the war the amount of money in circulation had risen fourfold and prices some 140 percent. Yet the German mark had suffered no more than the British pound, was somewhat weaker than the American dollar but stronger than the French franc. Five years later, in December 1923, the Reichsbank had issued 496.5 quintillion marks, each of which had fallen to one-trillionth of its 1914 gold value.\nHow stupendous! Practically every economic good and service was costing trillions of marks. The American dollar was quoted at 4.2 trillion marks, the American penny at 42 billion marks. How could a European nation that prided itself on its high levels of education and scholarly knowledge suffer such a thorough destruction of its money? Who would inflict on a great nation such evil which had ominous economic, social, and political ramifications not only for Germany but for the whole world? Was it the victors of World War I who, in diabolical revenge, devastated the vanquished country through ruinous financial manipulation and plunder? Every mark was printed by Germans and issued by a central bank that was governed by Germans under a government that was purely German. It was German political parties, such as the Socialists, the Catholic Centre Party, and the Democrats, forming various coalition governments, that were solely responsible for the policies they conducted. Of course, admission of responsibility for any calamity cannot be expected from any political party.\n|How could a European nation that prided itself on its high levels of education and scholarly knowledge suffer such a thorough destruction of its money?|\nThe reasoning that led these parties to inflate the national currency at such astronomical rates is not only interesting for economic historians, but also very revealing of the rationale for monetary destruction. The doctrines and theories that led to the German monetary destruction have since then caused destruction in many other countries. In fact, they may be at work right now all over the western world. In our judgment, four erroneous doctrines or theories guided the German monetary authorities in those baleful years.\nThe most amazing economic sophism that was advanced by eminent financiers, politicians, and economists endeavored to show that there was neither monetary nor credit inflation in Germany. These experts readily admitted that the nominal amount of paper money issued was indeed enormous. But the real value of all currency in circulation, that is, the gold value in terms of gold or goods prices, they argued, was much lower than before the war or than that of other industrial countries.","id":"<urn:uuid:190c0303-9df1-4b0e-8950-1d2edf25cb12>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/archive.mises.org\/5817\/hyperinflation-in-germany-1914-1923\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9734117389,"token_count":726,"score":3.453125,"int_score":3}

Among them is feature selection that selects a subset of discriminative features or attribute for model building due to its ability to avoid overfitting issue, improve model performance, provide faster and producing reliable model. This paper proposes a new method based on rough set algorithms, which is a rule-based data mining method to select the important features in bioinformatics datasets. Amino acid compositions are used as conditional features for the classification task. However, our results indicate that all amino acid composition features are equally important thus selecting the features are unnecessary. We do confirm the need of having a balance classes in classifying the protein function by demonstrating an increase of more than 15% in accuracy.\nElectrical Engineering and Informatics, 2009.

{"text":"They are not expecting any angry birds, but bird-watchers are already seeing evidence of what is expected to be a major invasion of hungry birds winging through the region.\nNormally content to hang out in the deep forests of Canada, grosbeaks, pine siskins, finches, redpolls and other seed-eaters are winging their way south, hoping to find something to eat. The tree seed crop, normally plentiful in the forests of Ontario and Quebec, has in some cases failed completely, causing what is known as a bird irruption.\n\u201cThe invasion is under way,\u201d said David Small, president of the Athol Bird and Nature Club and one of the Central Massachusetts bird count leaders. \u201cI had redpolls Sunday at the home feeder, which don't show up every year, and often not until January or February.\u201d\nMr. Small, who is a supervisor at the Quabbin Reservoir, said he has been seeing pine grosbeaks at the reservoir headquarters and several locations. Central Massachusetts birders also report seeing white-winged and red crossbills.\n\u201cI was at Plum Island and Salisbury in early November and saw 250-plus white-winged crossbills,\u201d he said. \u201cSo a big year is upon us. I can't recall a year it started this early with such diversity and large numbers.\u201d\nBased on data from ornithologists in Ontario, the National Audubon Society issued a winter bird warning \u2014 not really warning of disaster \u2014 that because there is so little to eat up north, a bird invasion is under way. The warning was issued more for the interest of those who will take part in the Audubon's Christmas Bird Count, which takes place all over the country from Dec. 14 through Jan. 5. The bird count often offers up data to support what ornithologists are predicting based on climate conditions. The seed crop failure may have been connected to a lack of rainfall. Central and Eastern Canada experienced long-term drought conditions this year.\nOver the years, some species of seed-eating birds have been seen in small numbers; some are not seen for several years at a time, but the region saw a flood of pine siskins pass through in October and November. The birds enjoyed what they could get from the limited number of feeders out in Central Massachusetts at the time and headed off, possibly making their way as far south as North and South Carolina.\nThis year's small bird irruption followed a banner year for the eye candy of wild birds \u2014 snowy owls. The large white raptors were seen throughout the country as they, too, went off in search of food.\nIrruptions occur regularly when food supplies of various types are disrupted. In the case of the owls, it was a lack of small mammals for them to eat.\nLocal birders have been keeping close watch on the ebb and flow of species. Recently there have been reports on WPI's Central Massachusetts Bird Update list of pine grosbeaks at Quaboag Pond in Brookfield and Worcester Airport. There have also been large numbers of pine grosbeaks seen in downtown Westminster, Royalston Common and several areas of Gardner and Lunenburg.\nBill Cormier, co-owner of The Bird Store and More in Sturbridge, said bird activity has been very active this early winter.\n\u201cThere was a big wave of pine siskins that came through here earlier in the season,\u201d he said.\nMr. Cormier said he is interested to see what is collected during the Sturbridge Christmas Bird Count, set for Dec. 18. The count will be led by local bird observer Mark Lynch; after 24 hours of recording birds, volunteers will report their data to compilers at The Bird Store.\nAlong with bird counts in Athol and Sturbridge, there will be counts in Worcester, Uxbridge and Westminster.\nFeeders are an important part of the bird-count effort, and Mr. Cormier said he recommends black oil sunflower seeds with some nuts mixed in.\n\u201cNuts are a major ingredient,\u201d he said.\nThe birds expected or already seen in this irruption are mostly regular sights in Central Massachusetts, although in smaller numbers, but a few are fairly rare.\n\u201cWe rarely get a hoary redpoll,\u201d Mr. Small said.\nThe hoary redpoll's range is mostly no farther south than the Canadian border, but Mr. Small said even it is a possibility this year.\nThe Athol and Worcester Christmas Bird Counts will be held Dec. 15, Westminster will be Dec. 23 and Quabbin and Uxbridge will be Dec. 29.","id":"<urn:uuid:9a6028aa-f264-4fb8-8c7f-9dfe336820d7>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.telegram.com\/article\/20121208\/NEWS\/112089902\/0\/hometeam_magazine","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9734746218,"token_count":982,"score":2.796875,"int_score":3}

He`s now in his 50`s and is having memory problems along with other physical ailments. I wondered if there have been studies done to understand the long term effects (especially on the brain) of substance abuse; and what the difference is with later long term abstinence.\nThank you for your question about what sounds like a very difficult situation. There are some things that are known ... and some that are unknown.\n1) Alcohol abuse is by far the most damaging to the brain and nervous system, and tends to be an immediate thing - meaning that once a person is sober for several months, the toxic effects of alcohol either \"freeze\" where they are or even resolve gradually to some degree. It is NOT typical for past alcohol problems to produce progressive \/ new \/ on-going brain effects.\n2) The drugs that have the most brain effects are PCP \/ LSD \/ Marijuana \/ and Amphetamines - especially methamphetamine. Generally cocaine and opioids (heroin and other prescription pain medicines) do not produce long-term damage to the brain \/ nervous system.\n3) If a person suffered pretty severe liver damage from either alcoholic cirrhosis, or hepatitis C or B, or a combination, then this can certainly produce progressive deterioration in brain function many years to decades later. It is the same situation if a person was infected by HIV as a consequence of their addictive disease.\nThat is the bad news. The good news is that IF he is truly sober, then be SURE that none of the following reversible or fairly treatable causes are not active for him. Be sure that he is:\n- not on prescription drugs that are potentially addictive.\n- not on other non-addictive medicines that can cause brain function problems. (Anything from some blood pressure medications to psychiatric medications to anti-seizure medications can cause brain function problems and result in deterioration.)\n- receiving plenty of vitamins and a well-balanced diet.\n- not hypothyroid.\n- not depressed or impaired from any other psychiatric disease.\n- not suffering from low oxygen (emphysema\/COPD).\n- not suffering from a toxic exposure like heavy metals.\nHope this guidance helps a little bit.\nTed Parran, MD\nAssociate Professor of General Medical Sciences\nSchool of Medicine\nCase Western Reserve University","id":"<urn:uuid:564417c2-d62d-460f-a578-5c603d43b603>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.netwellness.org\/question.cfm\/46111.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9349256158,"token_count":543,"score":2.625,"int_score":3}

It is most often beneficial in pediatric patients.\nTypes of surgery that may be done to treat severe cases of sleep apnea include:\n- Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty\u2014The doctor removes excess soft tissue from the nose and\/or throat.\n- Maxillomandibular advancement\u2014The jawbone is repositioned forward.\n- Tracheotomy \u2014For life-threatening cases of sleep apnea, an opening is made in the windpipe to allow for normal breathing.\nBariatric surgery may help with weight loss in some people who are obese . This surgery may reduce many of the complications that are related to obesity, including sleep apnea.\nOnly used in central apnea, acetazolamide (Diamox) may help improve the ability to regulate breathing. Overall, there is not a lot of evidence to support the use of medicines to treat sleep apnea.\nSupplemental oxygen may be given if blood levels of oxygen fall too low during sleep, even after opening the airway.\nYou may be able to prevent the onset of sleep apnea by maintaining a healthy weight .

{"text":"Throat cancer is a disease in which cancer cells grow in an abnormal way in the throat.\nCancer occurs when cells in the body\u2014in this case throat cells\u2014divide without control or order. Normally, cells divide in a regulated manner. If cells keep dividing uncontrollably when new cells are not needed, a mass of tissue forms, called a growth or tumor. The term cancer refers to malignant tumors, which can invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body. A benign tumor usually does not invade or spread.\nFactors that can increase your chance of developing throat cancer include:\n- Age: 40 or older\n- Sex: male\n- Smoking or use of any tobacco products\n- Excessive alcohol consumption\n- Family history\n- Vitamin A deficiency\n- Diet low in fruits and vegetables\n- Suppressed immune system\nInfections caused by certain viruses such as:\n- Epstein-Barr virus\n- Human papillomavirus\n- Radiation exposure\n- Excess consumption of cured meats or fish\n- Marijuana use\nExposure to certain materials such as in:\n- Nickel refining\n- Working with textile fibers\nIf you have any of these symptoms, do not assume it is due to throat cancer. These symptoms may be caused by other conditions. Tell your doctor if you have any of these:\n- Sore throat\n- Feeling that something is caught in the throat\n- Difficulty chewing or swallowing\n- Difficulty moving the jaw or tongue\n- Voice changes or hoarseness\n- Change in voice quality\n- Pain in the head, throat, or neck\n- Lump in the neck\n- Unexplained weight loss\n- Coughing blood\nThe doctor will ask about your symptoms and medical history. A physical exam will be done. The doctor may feel for any lumps in your neck. You may be referred to an otolaryngologist, a doctor who specializes in head and neck surgery.\nYour bodily fluids and tissue may be tested. This can be done with:\nYour internal structures may need to be viewed and examined. This can be done with:\nWhen throat cancer is found, staging tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread. Treatment depends on the stage of the cancer.\nSurgery removes the cancerous tumor and nearby tissue, and possibly nearby lymph nodes. In very rare cases, surgery to remove large tumors of the throat may also require removal of tissue for swallowing. As a result, food may enter the windpipe and reach the lungs, which might cause pneumonia. In cases when this is a risk, your surgeon may remove the larynx or voice box. The windpipe will be attached to the skin through a hole in the neck, which is used for breathing.\nThis is the use of radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Radiation may be:\n- External radiation therapy\u2014radiation directed at the tumor from a source outside the body\n- Internal radiation therapy\u2014radioactive materials placed into the throat in or near the cancer cells\nThis is the use of drugs to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy may be given in many forms including pill, injection, and\/or via a catheter. The drugs enter the bloodstream and travel through the body killing mostly cancer cells, but also some healthy cells.\nCombined Modality Therapy\nOften times, chemotherapy and radiation therapy are used together to kill cancer of the throat. This combined approach may be better than surgery or radiation alone.\nTo reduce your chance of getting throat cancer, take the following steps:\n- Don't smoke or use tobacco products. If you do smoke or use tobacco products, get help to quit.\n- Drink alcohol only in moderation. Moderate alcohol intake is two drinks per day for men and one drink per day for women.\n- Eat a healthful diet, one that is low in saturated fat and rich in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.\n- See your doctor and dentist regularly for check-ups and cancer screening.","id":"<urn:uuid:07a7d3db-49eb-4c14-b183-962c00182982>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/oakhillhospital.com\/your-health\/?\/11509\/sp","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.925504446,"token_count":821,"score":3.515625,"int_score":4}
{"text":"Principles of Finance\/Section 1\/Chapter 6\/Corp\/WACC\nWhen valuing a new venture by a company, it is necessary to use an appropriate discount rate. However, since corporations can be structured very differently, it is important to reflect that in the respective costs of capital. Let's say there are two similar companies in the same industry. Company A is financed 90% by equity (that is, stock) and 10% by debt (long term corporate bonds). Company B is financed by 25% equity, and 75% debt. These two companies would have to be valued according to their respective risk levels and required returns.\nOne common way to determine the cost of capital is to use the Weighted Average Cost of Capital, or WACC.\nIn this formula, V is equal to the value of the firm, or Debt (D) plus Equity (E) Example:\nAKL corporation is currently financed with $1,000,000 of 7% bonds, and $2,000,000 of common stock.

{"text":"You may associate pneumonia with the melodrama of a soap opera: prolonged hospital stays, oxygen tents, and family members whispering in bedside huddles. It's true that pneumonia can be serious. But more often pneumonia is an infection that can be easily treated at home without a hospital stay.\nWhat Is Pneumonia?\nPneumonia (pronounced: noo-mow-nyuh) is an infection of the lungs. When someone has pneumonia, lung tissue can fill with pus and other fluid, which makes it difficult for oxygen in the lung's air sacs to reach the bloodstream. With pneumonia, a person may have difficulty breathing and have a cough and fever; occasionally, chest or abdominal pain and vomiting are symptoms, too.\nPneumonia is commonly caused by viruses, such as the influenza virus(flu) and adenovirus. Other viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus(RSV), are common causes of pneumonia in young children and infants.\nBacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae can cause pneumonia, too. People with bacterial pneumonia are usually sicker than those with viral pneumonia, but can be effectively treated with antibiotic medications.\nYou might have heard the terms \"double pneumonia\" or \"walking pneumonia.\" Double pneumonia simply means that the infection is in both lungs. It's common for pneumonia to affect both lungs, so don't worry if your doctor says this is what you have \u2014 it doesn't mean you're twice as sick.\nWalking pneumonia refers to pneumonia that is mild enough that you may not even know you have it. Walking pneumonia (also called atypical pneumonia because it's different from the typical bacterial pneumonia) is common in teens and is often caused by a tiny microorganism, Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Like the typical bacterial pneumonia, walking pneumonia also can be treated with antibiotics.\nWhat Are the Signs and Symptoms?\nMany symptoms are associated with pneumonia; some of them, like a cough or a sore throat, are also common with other common infections. Often, people get pneumonia after they've had an upper respiratory tract infection like a cold.\nSymptoms of pneumonia can include:\nunusually rapid breathing\nchest or abdominal pain\nloss of appetite\nvomiting and dehydration\nSymptoms vary from person to person, and few people get all of them.\nWhen pneumonia is caused by bacteria, a person tends to become sick quickly and develops a high fever and has difficulty breathing. When it's caused by a virus, symptoms generally appear more gradually and might be less severe.\nSomeone's symptoms can help the doctor identify the type of pneumonia. Mycoplasma pneumoniae, for example, often causes headaches, sore throats, and rash in addition to the symptoms listed above.\nThe routine vaccinations that most people receive as kids help prevent certain types of pneumonia and other infections. If you have a chronic illness, such as sickle cell disease, you may have received additional vaccinations and disease-preventing antibiotics to help prevent pneumonia and other infections caused by bacteria.\nPeople with diseases that affect their immune system (like diabetes, HIV infection, or cancer), are 65 or older, or are in other high-risk groups should receive a pneumococcal vaccination. They also may receive antibiotics to prevent pneumonia that can be caused by organisms they're especially susceptible to. In some cases, antiviral medication might be used to prevent viral pneumonia or to lessen its effects.\nDoctors recommend that everyone 6 months and older gets a flu vaccine. That's because pneumonia often happens as a complication of the flu. Call your doctor's office to see when these vaccines are available.\nBecause pneumonia is often caused by germs, a good way to prevent it is to keep your distance from anyone you know who has pneumonia or other respiratory infections. Use separate drinking glasses and eating utensils; wash your hands frequently with warm, soapy water; and avoid touching used tissues and paper towels.\nYou also can stay strong and help avoid some of the illnesses that might lead to pneumonia by eating as healthily as possible, getting a minimum of 8 to 10 hours of sleep a night, and not smoking.\nHow Long Does It Last?\nThe length of time between exposure and feeling sick (called the incubation period) depends on many factors, particularly the type of pneumonia involved.\nWith influenza pneumonia, for example, someone may become sick as soon as 12 hours or as long as 3 days after exposure to the flu virus. But with walking pneumonia, a person may not have symptoms until 2 to 3 weeks after becoming infected.\nMost types of pneumonia resolve within a week or two, although a cough can linger for several weeks more. In severe cases, it may take longer to completely recover.\nIf you think you may have pneumonia, tell a parent or other adult and be sure you see a doctor. Be especially aware of your breathing; if you have chest pain or trouble breathing or if your lips or fingers look blue, you should go to a doctor's office or to a hospital emergency department right away.\nHow Is Pneumonia Treated?\nIf pneumonia is suspected, the doctor will perform a physical exam and might order a chest X-ray and blood tests. People with bacterial or atypical pneumonia will probably be given antibiotics to take at home. The doctor also will recommend getting lots of rest and drinking plenty of fluids.\nSome people with pneumonia need to be hospitalized to get better \u2014 usually babies, young kids, and people older than 65. However, hospital care may be needed for a teen who:\nalready has immune system problems\nhas cystic fibrosis\nis dangerously dehydrated or is vomiting a lot and can't keep fluids and medicine down\nhas had pneumonia frequently\nhas skin that's blue or pale in color, which reflects a lack of oxygen\nWhen pneumonia patients are hospitalized, treatment might include intravenous (IV) antibiotics (delivered through a needle inserted into a vein) and respiratory therapy (breathing treatments).\nAntiviral medications approved for adults and teens can reduce the severity of flu infections if taken in the first 1 to 2 days after symptoms begin. They're usually prescribed for teens who have certain underlying illnesses such as asthma or who have pneumonia or breathing difficulty.\nIf you have been exposed to influenza and you begin to develop symptoms of pneumonia, call a doctor.\nIf your doctor has prescribed medicine, be sure to follow the directions carefully.\nYou may feel better in a room with a humidifier, which increases the moisture in the air and soothes irritated lungs. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids, especially if you have a fever. If you have a fever and feel uncomfortable, ask the doctor whether you can take over-the-counter medicine such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen to bring it down. But don't take any medicine without checking first with your doctor \u2014 a cough suppressant, for example, may not allow your lungs to clear themselves of mucus.\nAnd finally, be sure to rest. This is a good time to sleep, watch TV, read, and lay low. If you treat your body right, it will repair itself and you'll be back to normal in no time.","id":"<urn:uuid:d7bdcf2d-ea1c-4316-a4f7-13bbedd58cdc>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/kidshealth.org\/PageManager.jsp?dn=K_HovnanianChildrens_Hospital&lic=184&cat_id=20174&article_set=22204&tracking=T_RelatedArticle","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9581039548,"token_count":1475,"score":3.75,"int_score":4}
{"text":"The test team views the use of a pulley as an intermediate step only, and has planned to shift to a reliance on windlasses like those that apparently were used to hoist sails on Egyptian ships.\n\"The whole approach has been to downgrade the technology,\" Gharib said. \"We first wanted to show that a kite could raise a huge weight at all. Now that we're raising larger and larger stones, we're also preparing to replace the steel scaffolding with wooden poles and the steel pulleys with wooden pulleys like the ones they may have used on Egyptian ships.\"\nFor Gharib, the idea of accomplishing heavy tasks with limited manpower is appealing from an engineer's standpoint because it makes more logistical sense.\n\"You can imagine how hard it is to coordinate the activities of hundreds if not thousands of laborers to accomplish an intricate task,\" said Gharib. \"It's one thing to send thousands of soldiers to attack another army on a battlefield. But an engineering project requires everything to be put precisely into place.\n\"I prefer to think of the technology as simple, with relatively few people involved,\" he explained.\nGharib and Graff came up with a way of building a simple structure around the obelisk, with a pulley system mounted in front of the stone. That way, the base of the obelisk would drag on the ground for a few feet as the kite lifted the stone, and the stone would be quite stable once it was pulled upright into a vertical position. If the obelisk were raised with the base as a pivot, the stone would tend to swing past the vertical position and fall the other way.\nThe top of the obelisk is tied with ropes threaded through the pulleys and attached to the kite. The operation is guided by a couple of workers using ropes attached to the pulleys.\nNo one has found any evidence that the ancient Egyptians moved stones or any other objects with kites and pulleys. But Clemmons has found some tantalizing hints that the project is on the right track. On a building frieze in a Cairo museum, there is a wing pattern in bas-relief that does not resemble any living bird. Directly below are several men standing near vertical objects that could be ropes.\nGharib's interest in the project is mainly to demonstrate that the technique may be viable.\n\"We're not Egyptologists,\" he said. \"We're mainly interested in determining whether there is a possibility that the Egyptians were aware of wind power, and whether they used it to make their lives better.\"\nNow that Gharib and his team have successfully raised the four-ton concrete obelisk, they plan to further test the approach using a ten-ton stone, and perhaps an even heavier one after that. Eventually they hope to obtain permission to try using their technique to raise one of the obelisks that still lie in an Egyptian quarry.\n\"In fact, we may not even need a kite. It could be we can get along with just a drag chute,\" Gharib said.\nAn important question is: Was there enough wind in Egypt for a kite or a drag chute to fly? Probably so, as steady winds of up to 30 miles per hour are not unusual in the areas where pyramids and obelisks were found.\n(c) 2001 Caltech\nSOURCES AND RELATED WEB SITES","id":"<urn:uuid:7989d2d3-3e6d-4a4d-ad8e-e7b19882a89a>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/news.nationalgeographic.com\/news\/2001\/06\/0628_caltechobelisk_2.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9741706848,"token_count":709,"score":3.578125,"int_score":4}

For developing countries to indigenize health research systems, it is essential to build research capacity. We review the positive features and weaknesses of various approaches to capacity building, emphasizing that complementary approaches to human resource development work best in the context of a systems and long-term perspective. As a key element of capacity building, countries must also address issues related to the enabling environment, in particular: leadership, career structure, critical mass, infrastructure, information access and interfaces between research producers and users. The success of efforts to build capacity in developing countries will ultimately depend on political will and credibility, adequate financing, and a responsive capacity-building plan that is based on a thorough situational analysis of the resources needed for health research and the inequities and gaps in health care. Greater national and international investment in capacity building in developing countries has the greatest potential for securing dynamic and agile knowledge systems that can deliver better health and equity, now and in the future.\nPalabras llave : Health services research [organization and administration]; Education, Graduate; Staff development; Investments; Access to information; Social justice; Academies and institutes; Interinstitutional relations; Developing countries; Developed countries.","id":"<urn:uuid:36ecb54b-dbb7-44fa-84a2-efacc44095e4>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.scielosp.org\/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&pid=S0042-96862004001000012&lng=es&nrm=iso&tlng=en","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.8949498534,"token_count":358,"score":2.515625,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Venerated from the early centuries of Christianity, Saint Christopher\u2014whose name means \"Christ-bearer\"\u2014was honored as the protector of travelers. According to \"The Golden Legend,\" Christopher ferried a small child across a river. As he did so, the child's weight grew increasingly heavy. When Christopher complained that it seemed as if he had carried the weight of the world, the child replied, \"Wonder not, Christopher, for not only has thou borne the whole world upon thy shoulders, but Him who created the world. For I am Christ thy King.\" In this imposing statuette-reliquary, Christopher strides through the water, twisting as he turns to look at the Christ Child, who holds an orb in reference to his dominion. The small leaves sprouting from the top of Christopher's staff are a harbinger of the miracle promised by Christ\u2014that if the saint, upon his return home, planted the staff in the ground, it would bear leaves and fruit in the morning.The hallmarks stamped on the hem of the saint's cloak and on the statue's base indicate that this piece was made by a goldsmith in Toulouse. The reliquary, excellently preserved, reveals a masterful treatment of the material. The soft, rich folds of the saint's cloak belie their metal substance. The ungilded surfaces of the faces are framed by the crisp design of the hair. The engraving of the short curls of the Christ Child, the hair and flowing beard of the saint, and the fish in the turbulent water are accented by the juxtaposition of large areas of silver with bright flashes of gilding.

{"text":"It is obvious that some people are more successful in different intellectual domains than others. Gardner's Multiple Intelligences suggests eight different domains of intellectual skill people can identify with. The domains consist of the following, in which people can score any level in all categories: linguistic, logico-mathematical, spatial, musical, bodily-kinesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal and naturalistic. Although his model is impossible to falsify, this idea is important because it serves as a good starting point in which scientists can begin distinguishing what qualifies as an \"intelligence\" versus a talent. However, it is possible that talents and intelligence are actually the same, when intelligence is defined among Gardner's approach. It is impossible to say Einstein had a talent in math yet didn't identify with that intelligence. A causation approach seems to be inapplicable because research points towards intelligence being considerably stable, while talents can be improved... yet those talents remain in the same realm as its partnering intelligence. This article talks about how there is a controversy on the misuse of his idea into new teaching methods. However, who said that just because someone is intelligent in music means that they will all of a sudden learn geography classes significantly better based on singing the information?

{"text":"Tornadoes are the most intense storms on the planet, and they\u2019re never discussed without at least some mention of the term wind shear. Many of us sitting at home, though, have no idea what wind shear is, or if we do, how it affects tornado production.\nWhat is Wind Shear\nWind shear, although it might sound complex, is a simple concept. Wind shear is merely the change in wind with height, in terms of wind direction and speed. I think that we all understand that the wind is generally stronger in the atmosphere over our heads than it is here on the ground, and if we think of the atmosphere in terms of the three dimensions that it has, it should not be surprising that the wind above us might also be blowing from a different direction than the wind at the ground. When that happens\u2013the wind speed and direction vary with height\u2013wind shear is occurring.\nWind Shear and Supercell Thunderstorms\nThis wind shear is an important part of the process in the development of a supercell thunderstorm, from which the vast majority of strong tornadoes form.\nAll thunderstorms are produced by a powerful updraft\u2013a surge of air that rises from the ground into the upper levels of the atmosphere, and when this updraft forms in an area where wind shear is present, the updraft is influence by this speed and different direction of the wind above, pushing the column of air in the updraft into a more vertical alignment.\nRain\u2019s Influence on Tornado Production\nNeedless to say, thunderstorms typically produce very heavy rain, and rain-cooled air is much heavier than the warm air of the updraft, so the rain-cooled air, produces a compensating downdraft (what comes up, must come down). This downdraft pushes the part of the rotating air that was forced in its direction by the stronger wind aloft downward, and the result is a horizontal column of rotating air.\nThat\u2019s Not a Tornado!\nI know what you\u2019re thinking that you\u2019ve seen enough TLC or Discovery Channel shows to know that a horizontal column of air is NOT a tornado; you need a vertical column of air.\nThis Can Be a Tornado\nYou\u2019re right, but remember the updraft that is driving the thunderstorm is still working, and it\u2019s able to pull the horizontal, spinning column of air into the thunderstorm, resulting in a vertical column of spinning air.\n(NOAA image showing vertical column of air in a supercell thunderstorm)\nThe result is a rotating thunderstorm capable of producing a tornado, and it would not be possible without wind shear.\n(NOAA image showing tornado formation in supercell thunderstorm)","id":"<urn:uuid:7400301c-e625-46d5-be90-1020cf8d52f8>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/cloudyandcool.com\/2009\/05\/05\/wind-shear-and-tornadoes\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9167638421,"token_count":573,"score":4.15625,"int_score":4}
{"text":"When you work on introducing a new technology to a population and region, you discover lots of intriguing impediments to that introduction that you\u2019d never have imagined. Yesterday (October 11, 2012) the Maine Fuel Board voted to allow Maine Energy Systems to engage in an \u201cEmerging Technologies\u201d project with them that might lead to elimination of one of those impediments for the pellet central heating industry in the State of Maine.\nMaine is unique in its licensure of technicians for \u201csolid fuels.\u201d In Maine a person installing a boiler must have \u201csolid fuel\u201d authority on his license to legally install a \u201csolid fuel\u201d boiler in someone else\u2019s building. (It\u2019s a bit more complicated than that, but let\u2019s avoid the levels of license detail.) The need for this rule apparently arose from three potential hazards associated with \u201csolid fuel\u201d boilers: the possibility for a thermal run-away during a power outage as combustion continues on a load of fuel while circulation fails due to lack of power, high chimney temperatures, and high boiler surface temperatures.\nAs highly sophisticated automatic pellet boilers made their way into the American market, they were defined in Maine as \u201csolid fuel\u201d appliances because pellets are solid. While that seems innocent and logical enough, the categorization has one substantial flaw and it creates one significant impediment to product growth in the marketplace.\nState-of-the-art pellet boilers display none of the attributes that led to the perceived need for \u201csolid fuel\u201d rules in Maine. The rules were devised for cordwood boilers and coal stoker boilers that can hold a significant charge of fuel at any given time. The combustion of that fuel is relatively uncontrolled. Pellet boilers burn a very small quantity of fuel at any given time, and the combustion of that fuel is highly controlled. Combustion stops almost immediately if the power goes out, hence, no excessive heat can be produced during a power outage.\nCordwood boilers and coal stoker boilers can produce very high stack temperatures. The exhaust gas temperatures from state-of-the-art pellet boilers are very much like those of modern oil boilers. In fact these boilers are so efficient, the stack gas temperature is often quite cool, 250F, or so, but it never exceeds 400F. Therefore, high chimney temperatures never occur.\nOld cordwood and coal stoker boilers could develop high surface temperatures making installed distance from combustible surfaces important. The surface temperature of these state-of-the-art pellet boilers is the same as the temperature of the room. The heat exchangers are extremely well insulated to achieve the desired efficiencies. So, the worry about proximity of flammable materials due to high boiler surface temperatures is not justified with these boilers.\nBecause these highly sophisticated boilers are lumped in the same category as cordwood boilers and coal stoker boilers, \u201csolid fuel\u201d license holders must install them in Maine. There are many fewer \u201csolid fuel\u201d license holders than ordinary oil license holders, so scheduling boiler installations in this rapidly growing segment is very challenging in the busy times of the year. Other busy technicians find it hard to justify studying for a test that focuses generally on boilers they\u2019ll never see, so they\u2019re not inclined to prepare for the \u201csolid fuel\u201d test to install pellet boilers as they\u2019re just beginning to make a mark on the marketplace.\nThe Emerging Technologies Project\nOn October 11, 2012, the Maine Fuel Board approved a request made by Maine Energy Systems for a year long project intended to confirm the company\u2019s assertion that their boilers, and those similar to them, can be installed by oil boiler license holders who have been suitably trained in the differences between pellet boilers and oil boilers.\nThis is great news for the pellet industry in Maine as the State\u2019s boiler inspectors will inspect some, or all, of these installations and, thereby, become much more familiar with these sorts of systems. If the project leads to the anticipated conclusion, the request to re-categorize the boilers for licensure requirement purposes should be reasonably received. We have little doubt that the Project will reach successful conclusion as these very same boilers are installed throughout the Northeast by the same technicians who install oil boilers and who have been trained at Maine Energy Systems in fuel handling and burner adjustment.\nIn the meantime, Maine Energy Systems will be training oil boiler technicians in the installation of their equipment to ensure that all who choose to install the MESys AutoPellet boiler can do it this heating season on a schedule that works for them.\nDutch Dresser is the Managing Director of Maine Energy Systems in Bethel, Maine.","id":"<urn:uuid:c1783214-b727-484c-bcab-391bee417335>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.maineenergysystems.com\/blog\/?cat=14","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9496868849,"token_count":1001,"score":2.703125,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Hold the salt: UCLA engineers develop revolutionary new desalination membrane\nProcess uses atmospheric pressure plasma to create filtering 'brush layer'\nDesalination can become more economical and used as a viable alternate water resource.\nBy Wileen Wong Kromhout\nOriginally published in UCLA Newsroom\nResearchers from the UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science have unveiled a new class of reverse-osmosis membranes for desalination that resist the clogging which typically occurs when seawater, brackish water and waste water are purified.\nThe highly permeable, surface-structured membrane can easily be incorporated into today's commercial production system, the researchers say, and could help to significantly reduce desalination operating costs. Their findings appear in the current issue of the Journal of Materials Chemistry.\nReverse-osmosis (RO) desalination uses high pressure to force polluted water through the pores of a membrane. While water molecules pass through the pores, mineral salt ions, bacteria and other impurities cannot. Over time, these particles build up on the membrane's surface, leading to clogging and membrane damage. This scaling and fouling places higher energy demands on the pumping system and necessitates costly cleanup and membrane replacement.\nThe new UCLA membrane's novel surface topography and chemistry allow it to avoid such drawbacks.\n\"Besides possessing high water permeability, the new membrane also shows high rejection characteristics and long-term stability,\" said Nancy H. Lin, a UCLA Engineering senior researcher and the study's lead author. \"Structuring the membrane surface does not require a long reaction time, high reaction temperature or the use of a vacuum chamber. The anti-scaling property, which can increase membrane life and decrease operational costs, is superior to existing commercial membranes.\"\nThe new membrane was synthesized through a three-step process. First, researchers synthesized a polyamide thin-film composite membrane using conventional interfacial polymerization. Next, they activated the polyamide surface with atmospheric pressure plasma to create active sites on the surface. Finally, these active sites were used to initiate a graft polymerization reaction with a monomer solution to create a polymer \"brush layer\" on the polyamide surface. This graft polymerization is carried out for a specific period of time at a specific temperature in order to control the brush layer thickness and topography.\n\"In the early years, surface plasma treatment could only be accomplished in a vacuum chamber,\" said Yoram Cohen, UCLA professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering and a corresponding author of the study. \"It wasn't practical for large-scale commercialization because thousands of meters of membranes could not be synthesized in a vacuum chamber. It's too costly. But now, with the advent of atmospheric pressure plasma, we don't even need to initiate the reaction chemically. It's as simple as brushing the surface with plasma, and it can be done for almost any surface.\"\nIn this new membrane, the polymer chains of the tethered brush layer are in constant motion. The chains are chemically anchored to the surface and are thus more thermally stable, relative to physically coated polymer films. Water flow also adds to the brush layer's movement, making it extremely difficult for bacteria and other colloidal matter to anchor to the surface of the membrane.\n\"If you've ever snorkeled, you'll know that sea kelp move back and forth with the current or water flow,\" Cohen said. \"So imagine that you have this varied structure with continuous movement. Protein or bacteria need to be able to anchor to multiple spots on the membrane to attach themselves to the surface \u2014 a task which is extremely difficult to attain due to the constant motion of the brush layer. The polymer chains protect and screen the membrane surface underneath.\"\nAnother factor in preventing adhesion is the surface charge of the membrane. Cohen's team is able to choose the chemistry of the brush layer to impart the desired surface charge, enabling the membrane to repel molecules of an opposite charge.\nThe team's next step is to expand the membrane synthesis into a much larger, continuous process and to optimize the new membrane's performance for different water sources.\n\"We want to be able to narrow down and create a membrane selection system for different water sources that have different fouling tendencies,\" Lin said. \"With such knowledge, one can optimize the membrane surface properties with different polymer brush layers to delay or prevent the onset of membrane fouling and scaling.\n\"The cost of desalination will therefore decrease when we reduce the cost of chemicals [used for membrane cleaning], as well as process operation [for membrane replacement]. Desalination can become more economical and used as a viable alternate water resource.\"\nCohen's team, in collaboration with the UCLA Water Technology Research (WaTeR) Center, is currently carrying out specific studies to test the performance of the new membrane's fouling properties under field conditions.\n\"We work directly with industry and water agencies on everything that we're doing here in water technology,\" Cohen said. \"The reason for this is simple: If we are to accelerate the transfer of knowledge technology from the university to the real world, where those solutions are needed, we have to make sure we address the real issues. This also provides our students with a tremendous opportunity to work with industry, government and local agencies.\"\nA paper providing a preliminary introduction to the new membrane also appeared in the Journal of Membrane Science last month.\nPublished: Thursday, April 08, 2010","id":"<urn:uuid:c0b175bb-65fb-420e-a881-a80b91d00ecd>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.environment.ucla.edu\/water\/news\/article.asp?parentid=6178","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9249808192,"token_count":1115,"score":2.8125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"A Fertility Specialist Tells You About This Medication Used In The Treatment Of Infertility\nMark Kan, MD\nWhat is Clomid, and how does it work?\nThe expert answers\nClomiphene citrate (also known as Clomid or Serophene) is a medication that is commonly used in fertility treatment. Because it is relatively inexpensive and can be administered orally, clomiphene is generally one of the first medications prescribed for patients who do not ovulate regularly.\nIn women who do ovulate regularly, clomiphene may be used for \"superovulation,\" where 2 or 3 eggs are produced. This increases the number of \"targets\" for the sperm, thereby increasing the chance of pregnancy.\nClomiphene is normally administered for five days during the follicular part of the cycle (the portion of the cycle following menstrual bleeding). Clomiphene is structurally similar to estrogen and acts on the estrogen receptor. First approved by the FDA in 1967, it has recently been reclassified as a selective-estrogen-receptor-modulator (SERM).\nHow does clomiphene work? The hormonal signals that cause the ovarian follicles to grow are released from the pituitary gland. These hormones are named Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Leutinizing Hormone (LH) for their actions in the ovary. The pituitary receives its signals from the hypothalamus in the brain. Clomiphene blocks the estrogen receptor and \"tricks\" the brain into thinking there are low levels of estrogen. The pituitary responds by releasing more FSH and LH, thus stimulating follicular growth in the ovaries.\nWhereas clomiphene \"tricks\" the pituitary into producing more FSH and LH, gonadotropin injections of FSH and LH increase the amount of signals directly. Treatment with these injections requires more intensive monitoring than does therapy with clomiphene. In general, treatment with fertility medications is initiated to help women overcome ovulatory dysfunction, or to produce multiple eggs so there is a higher chance of achieving pregnancy.\nIn the \"Clomiphene citrate challenge test\" (CCCT), clomiphene is administered and FSH levels are compared before and after treatment. In theory, clomiphene blocks the negative feedback of estrogen, leaving only inhibin (a substance that inhibits FSH) to suppress FSH. In some women, inhibin alone is not able to block the high levels of FSH without the help of estrogen. The CCCT will therefore be abnormal and show high FSH levels after clomiphene in women with diminished ovarian reserve.\nWhile the CCCT may help to identify some patients with diminished ovarian reserve, there is no single test that can predict which patients can or cannot become pregnant.","id":"<urn:uuid:7556cf26-35d1-4a9e-94ab-871b8379bbbb>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.pregnancyandbaby.com\/conception\/articles\/939587\/what-is-clomid-and-how-does-it-work","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9182517529,"token_count":592,"score":2.96875,"int_score":3}

In 1331, it was granted extensive \"Marktrechte\", e.g. the right to hold a market. In the 13th and 14th century many workshops (e.g. limeburners and raftsmen) settled in this area. A great fire destroyed large parts of the town in 1453, but with generous noble support reconstruction soon began. Thanks to the location at the river Isar, the rafting and also brewery trade the town soon flourished. 22 breweries could be counted in 1721. T\u00f6lz became also famous for arts and crafts with the beautiful coloured chests, cases and beds. In 1845, iodine was found close to T\u00f6lz.

{"text":"You had surgery to treat your gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is a condition that causes food or liquid to come up from your stomach into your esophagus (the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach).\nYour surgeon probably repaired a hiatal hernia with stitches. A hiatal hernia develops when the natural opening in your diaphragm is too large. Your diaphragm is the muscle layer between your chest and belly. Your stomach may bulge through this large hole into your chest. This bulging is called a hiatal hernia. It may make GERD symptoms worse.\nYour surgeon also wrapped the upper part of your stomach around the end of your esophagus to create pressure at the end of your esophagus. This pressure helps prevent stomach acid and food from flowing back up.\nYour surgery was done by making a large incision in your upper belly (open surgery) or with a laparoscope (a thin tube with a tiny camera on the end).\nWhat to Expect at Home\nMost patients go back to work 2 - 3 weeks after laparoscopic surgery and 4 - 6 weeks after open surgery.\nYou may have a feeling of tightness when you swallow for 6 - 8 weeks. This is from the swelling inside your esophagus. You may also have some bloating.\nWhen you get back home, you will be drinking a clear liquid diet for 2 weeks. You will be on a full liquid diet for about 2 weeks after that, and then a soft-food diet after that.\nOn the liquid diet:\nStart off with small amounts of liquid, about 1 cup at a time. Sip. Do NOT gulp. Drink liquids often during the day after surgery.\nAvoid cold liquids. Do not drink carbonated beverages. Do NOT drink through straws (they can bring air into your stomach).\nCrush pills, and take them with liquids for the first month after surgery.\nWhen you are eating solid foods again, chew well. Do not eat cold foods. Do not eat foods that clump together, such as rice or bread. Eat small amounts of food several times a day instead of 3 big meals.\nYour doctor will give you a prescription for pain medicine. Get it filled when you go home so you have it when you need it. Take your pain medicine before your pain becomes too severe.\nIf you have gas pains, try walking around to ease them.\nDo NOT drive, operate any machinery, or drink alcohol when you are taking narcotic pain medicine. This medicine can make you very drowsy, and driving or using machinery is not safe.\nWalk several times a day. Do NOT lift anything heavier than 10 pounds (about the same as a gallon of milk). Do NOT do any pushing or pulling. Slowly increase how much you do around the house. Your doctor will tell you when you can increase your activity and return to work.\nTake care of your wound (incision):\nIf sutures (stitches), staples, or glue were used to close your skin, you may remove the wound dressings (bandages) and take a shower the day after surgery.\nIf tape strips (Steri-Strips) were used to close your skin, cover the wounds with plastic wrap before showering for the first week. Tape the edges of the plastic carefully to keep water out. Do NOT try to wash the Steri-Strips off. They will fall off on their own after about a week.\nDo not soak in a bathtub or hot tub, or go swimming, until your doctor tells you it is okay.\nWhen to Call the Doctor\nCall your doctor or nurse if:\nYour temperature is above 101 \u00b0F.\nYour incisions are bleeding, red, warm to the touch, or have a thick, yellow, green, or milky drainage.\nYour belly swells or hurts.\nYou have nausea or vomiting for more than 24 hours.\nYou have problems swallowing that keep you from eating.\nYou have problems swallowing that do not go away after 2 or 3 weeks.\nYou have pain that your pain medicine is not helping.\nYou have trouble breathing.\nYou have a cough that does not go away.\nYou cannot drink or eat.\nYour skin or the white part of your eyes turns yellow.\nPeterson RP, Pelligrini CA, Oelschlager BK.

{"text":"The following information was extracted from the publication \"Threatened\"\nproduced by BNZ in cooperation with the Department of Conservation\nand Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society.\nThe Predation Threat\nIn 1987, a dog was on the loose in Waitangi State forest in the Bay of Islands. For six weeks it rampaged through the forest killing every kiwi it encountered. By the time the dog was found, perhaps as many as 500 of the 1000 kiwi living there had been slaughtered. This carnage at Waitangi illustrates just how vulnerable the kiwi is to predators and the speed at which seemingly healthy populations can fail.\nOther predators introduced to New Zealand by humans may cause similar havoc. The main threat to the kiwi is posed by: Possums, stoats, ferrets, and feral (wild) cats who steal eggs and kill young. Larger predators include pigs and dogs.\nYoung kiwi leave the nest at just three weeks of age, weighing only 200g. Small and slow, they are easy prey. Very few survive this precarious journey from birth to 12 months, when they reach the critical size that enables them to stand up to most predators.\nHumans, primarily through destroying forests and introducing predators in the first place, pose the single greatest threat to the kiwi. Ironically, we are also their greatest hope.\nThe kiwi is a one-off evolutionary design, holding all sorts of biological records. New Zealand's ancient isolation and lack of mammals allowed it to occupy a habitat and lifestyle that everywhere else in the world would be occupied by a mammal.\nWhereas birds traditionally depend on sight, the kiwi is one of the few birds with a highly developed sense of smell. You can sometimes hear them sniffing around in the dark. Alarm them during the day and they will run off. Then, at a distance, just like a wolf or other mammal, they'll stick their bill (nose) in the air, sniffing to see if they are safe from pursuit.\nOther reasons the kiwi could pass for a mammal is its loose, hair-like feathers, its long whiskers, the fact it can't fly and that it burrows in the ground.\nOther kiwi curiosities include:\nBeing the only known bird to have external nostrils at the end of its bill. It literally sniffs out its food a bill-length below the surface.\nIt's huge eggs. The kiwi has one of the largest egg-to-body weight ratio of any bird. The mature egg averages 20% of the female's body weight. Compare that to 2% for an ostrich!\nBeing the smallest living member of the ratite family (which includes ostriches and emus).\nThey live in pairs \u2014 as monogamous couples \u2014 for most, if not all of their lives.\nSex role reversal: The female is bigger and dominates the male.\nIn some varieties, the male does most of the incubating of the eggs.\nThe eggs take an exceedingly long time to hatch \u2014 up to 80 days.\nKiwi tend to live in pairs, forming monogamous couples. These bonds are generally till death and have been known to last over 30 years. About every third day, the pair will shelter in the same burrow together. The relationship tends to be quite volatile and physical, the female generally calling the shots over her smaller partner.\nDuring the night, as they are out foraging for food or patrolling their territory, they will perform duets, calling to each other. The female has a lower hoarser call than the male.\nFrom the outside, it doesn't appear that kiwi domestic life is bliss. But the bond is long-lasting.\nThere are few surprises in the kiwi diet. It's mostly earthworms, spiders, fallen fruits and seeds, larvae of beetles and cicada and a mixture of forest invertebrates. But they will also take large food items like freshwater crays and even frogs. In captivity, kiwi have fished eels out of a pond, subdued them with a few thuds and eaten them.\nKiwi are extremely territorial birds, They protect their patch \u2014 which can be as much as 40 hectares \u2014 by calling or, if that fails, by chasing the intruder kiwi and giving it a good booting over. Very occasionally, kiwi kill each other fighting for territory.\nAcutely aware of neighbours, they will often engage in calling duels. If a bird is intruding into another's space, it will rush back at full speed into its own space before returning a neighbour's call.\nA gathering of kiwi is a rarity. However, on Stewart Island, they do live in small, mixed aged family groupings.\nKiwi Nests, er, Burrows!\nKiwi are burrowers. They may quickly clear a burrow at the end of a night's work, crash there during the day and then move on to a new burrow the next day.\nGreat Spotted Kiwi prefer dens. Unlike the Little Spotted Kiwi and the Brown Kiwi, who tends towards simple one-entrance burrows, the Great Spotted will put the time and effort into constructing a labyrinth of tunnels several metres long with more than one exit.\nCommon Kiwi Myths\nKiwi experts are keen to dispel myths surrounding the kiwi \u2014 particularly that they are half-blind and bumbling.\nHere are a few common ones:\nMyth: \"Kiwi fight with their beaks.\"\nTo use their beaks to fight would be like head-butting someone with your nose.\nAt the end of the beak are the kiwi's external nostrils. Finely tuned and capable of detecting a few parts per million of scent, the beak, when probing the ground, can detect worms and other food.\nMyth: \"Kiwi are cute, gentle little creatures.\"\nThey are actually super-strong and often extremely bad tempered. The adults can look after themselves using their razor sharp claws as weapons. A couple of slashes can quickly draw blood \u2014 as conservationists have often found when putting their hands down kiwi burrows.\nBecause they are so aggressive, DOC staff can attract them simply by imitating their call. Incensed that another kiwi is on their turf, the response is instant and dramatic:\n\"It's amazing to hear them coming to kick the intruder out. They sound like a deer charging, almost exploding, through the dark. Standing there, it's quite intimidating. I guess it's part of the threat display.\"\n\"Pete\" is a Great Spotted Kiwi in West Northland. \"We've just got to walk into his territory and he comes catapulting in for a hit-and-run. He belts you in the leg and then runs off into the undergrowth. I think he views us as super-big kiwi. He's probably given some trampers a helluva scare.\"\nMyth: \"Kiwi are a bit thick.\"\nAccording to Conservation Officers who know them best, they are capable of learning quickly and altering behaviour in the light of experience.\nMyth: \"Kiwi move slowly.\"\nSuperbly adapted to their natural habitat, the kiwi is extremely agile and quick moving. A kiwi can cover his territory \u2014 possibly the size of 60 football fields \u2014 in a night. This might take in three valley streams and all sorts of obstacles.\nMyth: \"Kiwi and half-blind.\"\nThe notion of their being half-blind probably stems from their being nocturnal and having small eyes. In fact, as Conservation Officers can testify, if you chase them at night, they can run very fast, swerving around trees and expertly navigating the undergrowth. Similarly, they are unfazed by daylight.\nKiwi Culture -- From a Maori Perspective\nThe Maori people have a very personal interest in seeing the kiwi survive and flourish.\nAccording to many Maori traditions, the kiwi is the oldest of all Tanemahuta's bird family. It was Tane, the god of the forest who, with different wives, created much of the natural world, including birds, trees, stones and humans.\nFor Maori, kiwi are, in effect, our elder siblings. And, like a good older brother or sister, they are very protective of us. That's partly why they patrol the forests nightly.\nKiwi -- Six Unique Varieties\nThere are six identified varieties of kiwi.\nThe Little Spotted Kiwi\nThe smallest (about the size of a bantam) and most endangered species, the \"Little Spots\" have a very mellow, often docile nature. They have suffered terrible that the hands of possums, stoats, cats and larger predators.\nNow extinct on mainland New Zealand, the largest remaining population is on Kapiti Island where 1000 birds occupy some 1900 ha of mixed forest, scrub and grassland. Sensitive management by DoC and the Maori Trustees of private land on Kapiti are ensuring that cats, dogs and other kiwi predators don't reach the island.\nThe Great Spotted Kiwi\nThe rugged mountaineer of the kiwi \u2014 found primarily in the high, often harsh hill country \u2014 the Great Spotted has forged a strange deal with evolution. The same harsh environment that makes it struggle from one day to the next also makes it tough going for the pigs, dogs and stoats that would otherwise be keen to pursue it.\nBig bold and handsome, it is found only in the South Island, mainly in North West Nelson, Central Westland and Eastern Canterbury.\nThe North Island Brown Kiwi\nBug noses and short tempers is one way to sum up the Brown Kiwi. They are little toughies ... and have to be to survive against humans, introduced predators and the natural challenges of their often harsh bush existence.\nThe North Island Brown Kiwi is found only in the upper two-thirds of the North Island. They are widespread in Northland in a diverse range of vegetation types including exotic forests and rough farm land.\nOkarito Brown Kiwi\nIn one sense, the new kid on the block. It was only in 1993 that the Okarito Brown, living in lowland forest just north of Franz Josef was identified as a distinct variety of kiwi. Tell-tale signs are its slightly greyish plumage sometimes accompanied by white facial feathers.\nSquat and round and bigger than their northern Brown Kiwi cousins, they can grow to almost the same size as Great Spotted Kiwi. The Southern Tokoeka are found in Fiordland and on Stewart Island. They are the most communal of the somewhat reclusive kiwi.\nThe Haast Tokoeka, found in the rugged mountains behind Haast, was also identified as a distant variety of Kiwi in 1993. They spend their summers in the high sub alpine tussock grasslands but probably retreat to the lowland forests in winter.\nKiwi Sightings -- Where You Can See Kiwi\nFew of us get the chance to see a kiwi in the wild but Brown Kiwi can be seen at the following places:","id":"<urn:uuid:9a72a1b6-062c-472b-953a-6ed25e5be7b9>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.mercurybay.co.nz\/local\/kiwiinfo.php","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9621695876,"token_count":2354,"score":3.875,"int_score":4}

{"text":"This collection consists of digital images of the correspondence of John Muir from 1856-1914. The vast majority of the letters\nwere sent and received by Muir, although the collection also includes some correspondence of selected family members and colleagues.\nMuir\u2019s correspondence offers a unique first-hand perspective on his thoughts and experiences, as well as those of his correspondents,\nwhich include many notable figures in scientific, literary, and political circles of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The\ncorrespondence forms part of the John Muir Papers microfilm set that filmed letters located at over 35 institutions.\nA Scottish-born journalist and naturalist, John Muir (1838-1914) studied botany and geology at the University of Wisconsin\n(1861-1863). He worked for awhile as a mill hand at the Trout Broom Factory in Meaford, Canada (1864-1866), then at an Indianapolis\ncarriage factory (1866-1867), until an accident temporarily blinded him and directed his thoughts toward full-time nature\nstudy. Striking out on foot for South America, Muir walked to the Gulf of Mexico (September 1867-January 1868), but a long\nillness in Florida led him to change his plans and turn his interests westward. Muir arrived by ship at San Francisco (March\n1868), walked to the Sierra Nevada Mountains and began a five year wilderness sojourn (1868-1873) during which he made his\nyear-round home in the Yosemite Valley. Working as a sheepherder and lumberman when he needed money for supplies, Muir investigated\nthe length and breadth of the Sierra range, focusing most of his attention on glaciation and its impact on mountain topography.\nHe began to publish newspaper articles about what he saw in the California mountains and these articles brought him to the\nattention of such intellectuals as Asa Gray and Ralph Waldo Emerson, both of whom sought him out during their visits to California.\nEncouraged by Jeanne Carr, wife of his one-time botany professor, Ezra S. Carr, Muir took up nature writing as a profession\n(1872). He set up winter headquarters in Oakland and began a pattern of spring and summer mountaineering followed by winter\nwriting based upon his travel journals that he held to until 1880. His treks took him to Mount Shasta (1874, 1875 & 1877),\nthe Great Basin (1876, 1877, 1878), southern California and the Coast Range (1877), and southern Alaska (1879). Muir found\nthat he could finance his modest bachelor lifestyle with revenue from contributions published in various San Francisco newspapers\nand magazines.

{"text":"Public Papers - 1991\nWhite House Fact Sheet on The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START)\nToday, the United States and the Soviet Union signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. This treaty marks the first agreement between the two countries in which the number of deployed strategic nuclear weapons will actually be reduced. Reductions will take place over a period of 7 years, and will result in parity between the strategic nuclear forces of the two sides at levels approximately 30 percent below currently deployed forces. Deeper cuts are required in the most dangerous and destabilizing systems.\nSTART provisions are designed to strengthen strategic stability at lower levels and to encourage the restructuring of strategic forces in ways that make them more stable and less threatening. The treaty includes a wide variety of very demanding verification measures designed to ensure compliance and build confidence.\nThe treaty sets equal ceilings on the number of strategic nuclear forces that can be deployed by either side. In addition, the treaty establishes an equal ceiling on ballistic missile throw-weight (a measure of overall capability for ballistic missiles). Each side is limited to no more than:\n-- 1600 strategic nuclear delivery vehicles (deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles [ICBM's], submarine launched ballistic missiles [SLBM's], and heavy bombers), a limit that is 36 percent below the Soviet level declared in September 1990 and 29 percent below the U.S. level.\n-- 6000 total accountable warheads, about 41 percent below the current Soviet level and 43 percent below the current U.S. level.\n-- 4900 accountable warheads deployed on ICBM's or SLBM's, about 48 percent below the current Soviet level and 40 percent below the current U.S. level.\n-- 1540 accountable warheads deployed on 154 heavy ICBM's, a 50-percent reduction in current Soviet forces. The U.S. has no heavy ICBM's.\n-- 1100 accountable warheads deployed on mobile ICBM's.\n-- Aggregate throw-weight of deployed ICBM's and SLBM's equal to about 54 percent of the current Soviet aggregate throw-weight.\nBallistic Missile Warhead Accountability\nThe treaty uses detailed counting rules to ensure the accurate accounting of the number of warheads attributed to each type of ballistic missile.\n-- Each deployed ballistic missile warhead counts as 1 under the 4900 ceiling and 1 under the 6000 overall warhead ceiling.\n-- Each side is allowed 10 on-site inspections each year to verify that deployed ballistic missiles contain no more warheads than the number that is attributed to them under the treaty.\nDownloading Ballistic Missile Warheads\nThe treaty also allows for a reduction in the number of warheads on certain ballistic missiles, which will help the sides transition their existing forces to the new regime. Such downloading is permitted in a carefully structured and limited fashion.\n-- The U.S. may download its three-warhead Minuteman III ICBM by either one or two warheads. The Soviet Union has already downloaded it's seven warhead SS - N - 18 SLBM by four warheads.\n-- In addition, each side may download up to 500 warheads on two other existing types of ballistic missiles, as long as the total number of warheads removed from downloaded missiles does not exceed 1250 at any one time.\nThe treaty places constraints on the characteristics of new types of ballistic missiles to ensure the accuracy of counting rules and prevent undercounting of missile warheads.\n-- The number of warheads attributed to a new type of ballistic missile must be no less than the number determined by dividing 40 percent of the missile's total throw-weight by the weight of the lightest RV tested on that missile.\n-- The throw-weight attributed to a new type must be no less than the missile's throw-weight capability at specified reference ranges (11,000 km for ICBM's and 9,500 km for SLBM's).\nSTART places significant restrictions on the Soviet SS - 18 heavy ICBM.\n-- A 50-percent reduction in the number of Soviet SS - 18 ICBM's; a total reduction of 154 of these Soviet missiles.\n-- New types of heavy ICBM's are banned.\n-- Downloading of heavy ICBM's is banned.\n-- Heavy SLBM's and heavy mobile ICBM's are banned.\n-- Heavy ICBM's will be reduced on a more stringent schedule than other strategic arms.\nBecause mobile missiles are more difficult to verify than other types of ballistic missiles, START incorporates a number of special restrictions and notifications with regard to these missiles. These measures will significantly improve our confidence that START will be effectively verifiable.\n-- Nondeployed mobile missiles and non-deployed mobile launchers are numerically and geographically limited so as to limit the possibility for reload and refire.\n-- The verification regime includes continuous monitoring of mobile ICBM production, restrictions on movements, on-site inspections, and cooperative measures to improve the effectiveness of national technical means of intelligence collection.\nBecause heavy bombers are stabilizing strategic systems (e.g., they are less capable of a short-warning attack than ballistic missiles), START counting rules for weapons on bombers are different than those for ballistic missile warheads.\n-- Each heavy bomber counts as one strategic nuclear delivery vehicle.\n-- Each heavy bomber equipped to carry only short-range missiles or gravity bombs is counted as one warhead under the 6000 limit.\n-- Each U.S. heavy bomber equipped to carry long-range nuclear ALCM's (up to a maximum of 150 bombers) is counted as 10 warheads even though it may be equipped to carry up to 20 ALCM's.\n-- A similar discount applies to Soviet heavy bombers equipped to carry long-range nuclear ALCM's. Each such Soviet heavy bomber (up to a maximum of 180) is counted as 8 warheads even though it may be equipped to carry up to 16 ALCM's.\n-- Any heavy bomber equipped for long-range nuclear ALCM's deployed in excess of 150 for the U.S. or 180 for the Soviet Union will be accountable by the number of ALCM's the heavy bomber is actually equipped to carry.\nBuilding on recent arms control agreements, START includes extensive and unprecedented verification provisions. This comprehensive verification regime greatly reduces the likelihood that violations would go undetected.\n-- START bans the encryption and encapsulation of telemetric information and other forms of information denial on flight tests of ballistic missiles. However, strictly limited exemptions to this ban are granted sufficient to protect the flight-testing of sensitive research projects.\n-- START allows 12 different types of on-site inspections and requires roughly 60 different types of notifications covering production, testing, movement, deployment, and destruction of strategic offensive arms.\nSTART will have a duration of 15 years, unless it is superseded by a subsequent agreement. If the sides agree, the treaty may be extended for successive 5-year periods beyond the 15 years.\nNoncircumvention and Third Countries\nSTART prohibits the transfer of strategic offensive arms to third countries, except that the treaty will not interfere with existing patterns of cooperation. In addition, the treaty prohibits the permanent basing of strategic offensive arms outside the national territory of each side.\nAir-Launched Cruise Missiles (ALCM's)\nSTART does not directly count or limit ALCM's. ALCM's are limited indirectly through their association with heavy bombers.\n-- Only nuclear-armed ALCM's with a range in excess of 600 km are covered by START.\n-- Long-range, conventionally armed ALCM's that are distinguishable from nuclear-armed ALCM's are not affected.\n-- Long-range nuclear-armed ALCM's may not be located at air bases for heavy bombers not accountable as being equipped for such ALCM's.\n-- Multiple warhead long-range nuclear ALCM's are banned.\nSea Launched Cruise Missiles (SLCM's)\nSLCMs are not constrained by the treaty. However, each side has made a politically binding declaration as to its plans for the deployment of nuclear-armed SLCM's. Conventionally-armed SLCM's are not subject to such a declaration.\n-- Each side will make an annual declaration of the maximum number of nuclear-armed SLCM's with a range greater than 600 km that it plans to deploy for each of the following 5 years.\n-- This number will not be greater than 880 long-range nuclear-armed SLCM's.\n-- In addition, as a confidence building measure, nuclear-armed SLCM's with a range of 300 - 600 km will be the subject of a confidential annual data exchange.\nThe Soviet Backfire bomber is not constrained by the treaty. However, the Soviet side has made a politically binding declaration that it will not deploy more than 800 air force and 200 naval Backfire bombers, and that these bombers will not be given intercontinental capability.\nThe START agreement consists of the treaty document itself and a number of associated documents. Together they total more than 700 pages. The treaty was signed in a public ceremony by Presidents Bush and Gorbachev in St. Vladimir's Hall in the Kremlin. The associated documents were signed in a private ceremony at Novo Ogaryevo, President Gorbachev's weekend dacha. Seven of these documents were signed by Presidents Bush and Gorbachev. Three associated agreements were signed by Secretary Baker and Foreign Minister Bessmertnykh. In addition, the START negotiators, Ambassadors Brooks and Nazarkin, exchanged seven letters related to START in a separate event at the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Moscow.\nMagnitude of START -- Accountable Reductions\nFollowing is the aggregate data from the Memorandum of Understanding, based upon agreed counting rules in START. (Because of those counting rules, the number of heavy bomber weapons actually deployed may be higher than the number shown in the aggregate.) This data is effective as of September 1990\n(TABLE START)and will be updated at entry into force:\nDelivery Vehicles .... 2,246 .... 2,500\nWarheads .... 10,563 .... 10,271\nBallistic Missile Warheads .... 8,210 .... 9,416\nHeavy ICBM's\/Warheads .... None .... 308\/3080\nThrow-weight (metric tons) .... 2,361.3 .... 6,626.3\nAs a result of the treaty, the above values will be reduced by the following percentages:\nDelivery Vehicles .... 29 percent .... 36 percent\nWarheads .... 43 percent .... 41 percent\nBallistic Missile Warheads .... 40 percent .... 48 percent\nHeavy ICBM's\/Warheads .... None .... 50 percent\nThrow-weight (metric tons) ....

{"text":"Each year more than 4 million homeless pets are killed as a result of overpopulation, but families who adopt from animal shelters or rescue groups can help preserve these lives and support the growing trend of socially responsible holiday shopping. Best Friends Animal Society encourages families this holiday season to give the precious gift of life by adopting homeless pets rather than buying from breeders, pet stores or online retailers.\nAlso, resist the urge to surprise a friend or family member with a living gift. Choosing the right pet is an extremely personal decision, one that should be made carefully by the adults who will be caring for the animal for its 15- to 20-year lifetime. Instead, offer an adoption gift certificate paired with a basket of pet care items or stuffed animal for the holiday itself, and then let the person or family choose the actual pet that feels right to them.\nOnce you\u2019ve decided to adopt, keep in mind that welcoming a pet into your life is a big decision and requires important preparation. Best Friends offers tips and advice to help make a smooth transition at home:\n* Determine roles and responsibilities \u2013 Before bringing home a new pet, discuss what roles and responsibilities each family member will take on. Who will be in charge of feeding, walks, changing the litter box and taking your pet for regular visits to the vet? Giving each family member a specific task will help everyone feel involved, especially young children.\n* Prep the house \u2013 Adding a pet to the house means adding new items to your shopping lists. For dogs, the basics are a collar and leash, chew toys, a kennel and dog bed. Cats need a litter box and litter, a scratching post and a carrying crate for transportation. Also don\u2019t forget food and toys.\n* Have your pet spayed\/neutered \u2013 Spaying or neutering is one of the greatest gifts you can provide your pet and community. It not only helps control the overabundance of pets, but can also help prevent medical and behavioral problems from developing. Most shelters include this with the adoption package or can recommend a local veterinarian in your area, so check with the staff at the shelter before you leave.\n* Research community rules and resources \u2013 Do a little research on what identification (tags, microchips, etc.) you might need for your pet. Scout out the local dog parks and runs for future outdoor fun, and make sure you know where emergency vet clinics or animal hospitals are located.\n* Set limits \u2013 Having pre-determined rules will create consistency in training and help make the home a pleasant environment for you and your pet. Will your pet be allowed to snuggle with you in bed or curl up with you on your furniture? Will treats be limited to one a day? It\u2019s important to discuss these questions as a family before your new family member arrives.\nAn estimated 17 million people will be adding pets to their families this year, so this season, help bring some holiday cheer to a homeless pet by adopting your newest companion.","id":"<urn:uuid:cefe5610-f57c-40d2-938e-5283619dbcb4>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/queensledger.com\/view\/full_story\/20992104\/article-The-holiday-gift-that-keeps-on-giving--opt-to-adopt-a-pet--save-a-life?instance=pets","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9344787002,"token_count":614,"score":2.59375,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Ethics of dementia research\nWhat are clinical trials and how are they controlled\/governed?\nA clinical trial is a biomedical\/health-related study into the effects on humans of a new medical treatment (medicine\/drug, medical device, vaccine or new therapy), sometimes called an investigational medicinal product (IMP). Before a new drug is authorised and can be marketed, it must pass through several phases of development including trial phases in which its safety, efficacy, risks, optimal use and\/or benefits are tested on human beings. Existing drugs must also undergo clinical testing before they can be used to treat other conditions than that for which they were originally intended.\nOrganisations conducting clinical trials in the European Union must, if they wish to obtain marketing authorisation, respect the requirements for the conduct of clinical trials. These can be found in the Clinical Trials Directive (\u201cDirective 2001\/20\/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 April 2001 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the implementation of good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use\u201d).\nThere are also guidelines to ensure that clinical trials are carried out in accordance with good clinical practice. These are contained in the \u201cCommission Directive 2005\/28\/EC of 8 April 2005 laying down principles and detailed guidelines for good clinical practice as regards investigational medicinal products for human use, as well as the requirements for authorisation of the manufacturing or importation of such products\u201d (also known as the Good Clinical Practice or GCP for short). This document provides more concrete guidelines and lends further support to the Clinical Trials Directive.\nThe London-based European Medicines Agency (EMA) has published additional, more specific guidelines which must also be respected. These include guidelines on inspection procedures and requirements related to quality, safety and efficacy.\nCopies of the above-mentioned documents in 22 languages can be found at: http:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/enterprise\/pharmaceuticals\/clinicaltrials\/clinicaltrials_en.htm\nThe protection of people participating in clinical trials (and in most cases in other types of research) is further promoted by provisions of:\n- the European Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine (Oviedo Convention, Act 2619\/1998),\n- the Additional protocol to the Oviedo Convention concerning Biomedical Research\n- the Nuremberg Code of 1949,\n- the revised Helsinki Declaration of the World Medical Association regarding Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects,\n- The Belmont Report of 18 April 1979 on the Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research.\nWhat are the different phases of trials?\nTesting an experimental drug or medical procedure is usually an extremely lengthy process, sometimes lasting several years. The overall procedure is divided into a series of stages (known as phases) which are described below.\nClinical testing on humans can only begin after a pre-clinical phase, involving laboratory studies (in vitro) and tests on animals, which has shown that the experimental drug is considered safe and effective.\nWhilst a certain amount of testing can be carried out by means of computer modelling and by isolating cells and tissue, it becomes necessary at some point in time to test the drug on a living creature. Animal testing is an obligatory stage in the process of obtaining regulatory approval for new drugs and medicines, and hence a legal requirement (EU Directive 2001\/83\/EC relating to Medicinal Products for Human Use). The necessity of carrying out prior testing on animals is also stated in the World Medical Association\u2019s \u201cEthical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects.\nIn order to protect the well-being of research animals, researchers are guided by three principles which are called the 3Rs:\nReduce the number of animals used to a minimum\nRefine the way that experiments are carried out so that the effect on the animal is minimised and animal welfare is improved\nReplace animal experiments with alternative (non-animal) techniques wherever possible.\nIn addition, most countries will have official regulatory bodies which control animal research. Most animals involved in research are mice. However, no animal is sufficiently similar to humans (even genetically modified ones) to make human testing unnecessary. For this reason, the experimental drug must also be tested on humans.\nThe main phases of clinical trials\nClinical trials on humans can be divided into three main phases (literally, phase I, II and III). Each phase has specific objectives (please see below) and the number of people involved increases as the trial progresses from one phase to the next.\nPhase I trials\nPhase 1 trials are usually the first step in testing a new drug or treatment on humans after successful laboratory and animal testing. They are usually quite small scale and usually involve healthy subjects or sub-groups of patients who share a particular characteristic. The aims of these trials are:\n- to assess the safety of experimental drugs,\n- to evaluate any possible side effects,\n- to determine a safe dose range,\n- to see how the body reacts to the drug (how it is absorbed, distributed and eliminated from the body, the effects that it has on the body and the effects it has on biomarkers).\nDose ranging, sometimes called dose escalation, studies may be used as a means to determine the most appropriate dosage, but the doses administered to the subjects should only be a fraction of those which were found to cause harm to animals in the pre-clinical studies.\nThe process of determining an optimal dose in phase I involves quite a high degree of risk because this is the first time that the experimental treatment or drug has been administered to humans. Moreover, healthy people\u2019s reactions to drugs may be different to those of the target patient group. For this reason, drugs which are considered to have a potentially high toxicity are usually tested on people from the target patient group.\nThere are a few sequential approaches to phase I trials e.g. single ascending dose studies, multiple ascending dose studies and food effect.\nIn single ascending dose studies (SAD), a small group of subjects receive a very low dose of the experimental drug and are then observed in order to see whether that dose results in side effects. For this reason, trials are usually conducted in hospital settings. If no adverse side effects are observed, a second group of subjects are given a slightly higher dose of the same drug and also monitored for side-effects. This process is repeated until a dose is reached which results in intolerable side effects. This is defined as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).\nMultiple ascending dose studies (MAD) are designed to test the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of multiple doses of the experimental drug. A group of subjects receives multiple doses of the drug, starting at the lowest dose and working up to a pre-determined level. At various times during the period of administration of the drug, and particularly whenever the dose is increased, samples of blood and other bodily fluids are taken. These samples are analysed in order to determine how the drug is processed within the body and how well it is tolerated by the body.\nFood effect studies are investigations into the effect of food intake on the absorption of the drug into the body. This involves two groups of subjects being given the same dose of the experimental drug but for one of the groups when fasting and for the other after a meal. Alternatively, this could be done in a cross-over design whereby both groups receive the experimental drug in both conditions in sequence (e.g. when fasting and on another occasion after a meal). Food effect studies allow researchers to see whether eating before the drug is given has any effect on the absorption of the drug by the body.\nPhase II trials\nHaving demonstrated the initial safety of the drug (often on a relatively small sample of healthy individuals), phase II clinical trials can begin. Phase II studies are designed to explore the therapeutic efficacy of a treatment or drug in people who have the condition that the drug is intended to treat. They are sometimes called therapeutic exploratory trials and tend to be larger scale than Phase I trials.\nPhase II trials can be divided into Phase IIA and Phase IIB although sometimes they are combined.\nPhase IIA is designed to assess dosing requirements i.e. how much of the drug should patients receive and up to what dose is considered safe? The safety assessments carried out in Phase I can be repeated on a larger subject group. As more subjects are involved, some may experience side effects which none of the subjects in the Phase I experienced. The researchers aim to find out more about safety, side effects and how to manage them.\nPhase IIB studies focus on the efficacy of the drug i.e. how well it works at the prescribed doses. Researchers may also be interested in finding out which types of a specific disease or condition would be most suitable for treatment.\nPhase II trials can be randomised clinical trials which involve one group of subjects being given the experimental drug and others receiving a placebo and\/or standard treatment. Alternatively, they may be case series which means that the drug\u2019s safety and efficacy is tested in a selected group of patients. If the researchers have adequately demonstrated that the experimental drug (or device) is effective against the condition for which it is being tested, they can proceed to Phase III.\nPhase III trials\nPhase III trials are the last stage before clinical approval for a new drug or device. By this stage, there will be convincing evidence of the safety of the drug or device and its efficacy in treating people who have the condition for which it was developed. Such studies are carried out on a much larger scale than for the two previous phases and are often multinational. Several years may have passed since the original laboratory and animal testing.\nThe main aims of Phase III trials are:\nto demonstrate that the treatment or drug is safe and effective for use in patients in the target group (i.e. in people for whom it is intended)\nto monitor side effects\nto test different doses or different ways of administering the drug\nto determine whether the drug could be used at different stages of the disease.\nto provide sufficient information as a basis for marketing approval\nResearchers may also be interested in showing that the experimental drug works for additional groups of people with conditions other than that for which the drug was initially developed. For example, they may be interested in testing a drug for inflammation on people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The drug would have already have proven safe and obtained marketing approval but for a different condition, hence the need for additional clinical testing.\nOpen label extension trails\nOpen label extension studies are often carried out immediately after a double blind randomised clinical trial of an unlicensed drug. The aim of the extended study is to determine the safety and tolerability of the experimental drug over a longer period of time, which is generally longer than the initial trial and may extend up until the drug is licensed. Participants all receive the experimental drug irrespective of which arm of the previous trial they were in. Consequently, the study is no longer blind in that everybody knows that each participant is receiving the experimental drug but the participants and researchers still do not know which group participants were in during the initial trial.\nPost-marketing surveillance studies (phase IV)\nAfter the three phases of clinical testing and after the treatment has been approved for marketing, there may be a fourth phase to study the long-term effects of drugs or treatment or to study the impact of another factor in combination with the treatment (e.g. whether a particular drug reduces agitation).\nUsually, such trials are sponsored by pharmaceutical companies and described as pharmacovigilance. They are not as common as the other types of trials (as they are not necessary for marketing permission). However, in some cases, the EMA grants restricted or provisional marketing authorisation, which is dependent on additional phase IV trails being conducted.\nExpanded access to a trial\nSometimes, a person might be likely to benefit from a drug which is at various stages of testing but does not fulfil the conditions necessary for participation in the trial (e.g. s\/he may have other health problems). In such cases and if the person has a life-threatening or serious condition for which there is no effective treatment, s\/he may benefit from \u201cexpanded access\u201d use of the drug. There must, however, be evidence that the drug under investigation has some likelihood of being effective for that patient and that taking it would not constitute an unreasonable risk.\nThe use of placebo and other forms of comparison\nThe main purpose of clinical drug studies is to distinguish the effect of the trial drug from other influences such as spontaneous change in the course of the disease, placebo effect, or biased observation. A valid comparison must be made with a control. The American Food and Drugs Administration recognises different types of control namely,\n- active treatment with a known effective therapy or\n- no treatment,\n- historical treatment (which could be an adequately documented natural history of the disease or condition, or the results of active treatment in comparable patients or populations).\nThe EMA considers three-armed trials (including the experimental medicine, a placebo and an active control) as a scientific gold standard and that there are multiple reasons to support their use in drug development  .\nParticipants in clinical trials are usually divided into two or more groups. One group receives the active treatment with the experimental substance and the other group receives a placebo, a different drug or another intervention. The active treatment is expected to have a positive curative effect whereas the placebo is expected to have zero effect. With regard to the aim to develop more effective treatments, there are two possibilities:\n1. the experimental substance is more effective than the current treatment or\n2. it is more effective than no treatment at all.\nAccording to article 11 of the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research (IEGBR) of 2002, participants allocated to the control group in a trial for a diagnostic, therapeutic or preventive intervention should receive an established effective intervention but it may in some circumstances be considered ethically acceptable to use a placebo (i.e. no treatment). In article 11 of the IEGBR, reasons for the use of placebo are:\n1. that there is no established intervention\n2. that withholding an established effective intervention would expose subjects to, at most, temporary discomfort or delay in relief of symptoms\n3. that use of an established effective intervention as comparator would not yield scientifically reliable results and use of placebo would not add any risk of serious or irreversible harm to the subjects.\n November 2010, EMA\/759784\/2010 Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use\nThe use of placebo and the issue of irreversible harm\nIt has been suggested that clinical trials are only acceptable in ethical terms if there is uncertainty within the medical community as to which treatment is most suitable to cure or treat a disease (National Bioethics Commission of Greece, 2005). In the case of dementia, whilst there is no cure, there are a few drugs for the symptomatic treatment of dementia. Consequently, one could ask whether it is ethical to deprive a group of participants of treatment which would have most likely improved their condition for the purpose of testing a potentially better drug (National Bioethics Commission of Greece, 2005). Can they be expected to sacrifice their own best interests for those of other people in the future? It is also important to ask whether not taking an established effective intervention is likely to result in serious or irreversible harm.\nIn the 2008 amended version of the Helsinki Declaration  (World Medical Association, 1964), the possible legitimate use of placebo and the need to protect subjects from harm are addressed.\n\u201c32. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against those of the best current proven intervention, except in the following circumstances:\nThe use of placebo, or no treatment, is acceptable in studies where no current proven intervention exists; or\nWhere for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of placebo is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the patients who receive placebo or no treatment will not be subject to any risk of serious or irreversible harm. Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option.\u201d (WMA, 1964 with amendments up to 2008)\nThe above is also quite similar to the position supported by the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues (PCSBI) (2011). In its recently published report entitled \u201cMoral science: protecting participants in human subjects research  \u201d, the Presidential Commission argues largely in favour of a \u201cmiddle ground\u201d for ethical research, citing the work of Emanuel and Miller (2001) who state:\n\u201cA placebo-controlled trial can sometimes be considered ethical if certain methodological and ethical standards are met. It these standards cannot be met, then the use of placebos in a clinical trial is unethical.\u201d (Emanuel and Miller, 2001 cited in PCSBI, 2011, p. 89).\nOne of the standards mentioned is the condition that withholding proven effective treatment will not cause more than minimal harm.\nThe importance of placebo groups for drug development\nThe ethical necessity to include a placebo arm in a clinical trial may differ depending on the type of drug being developed and whether other comparable drugs exist. For example, a placebo arm would be absolutely necessary in the testing of a new compound for which no drug has yet been developed. This would be combined with comparative arms involving other alternative drugs which have already been proven effective. For studies involving the development of a drug based on an existing compound, a comparative trial would be necessary but not necessarily with a placebo arm, or at least with a smaller placebo arm Nevertheless, the EMA emphasises the value of placebo-controlled trials in the development of new medicinal products even in cases where a proven effective drug exists:\n\u201cforbiddingplacebo-controlled trials in therapeutic areas where there are proven, therapeutic methods would preclude obtaining reliable scientific evidence for the evaluation of new medicinal products, and be contrary to public health interest as there is a need for both new products and alternatives to existing medicinal products.\u201d (EMA, 2001).\nIn 2001, concerns were raised about the interpretation of paragraph 29 of the 2000 version of the Helsinki Declaration in which prudence was called for in the use of placebo in research trials and it was advised that placebo should only be used in cases where there was no proven therapy for the condition under investigation. A document clarifying the position of the WMA regarding the use of placebo was issued by the WMA in 2001 in which it was made clear that the use of placebo might be ethically acceptable even if proven therapy was available. The current version of this statement is article 32 of the 2008 revised Helsinki Declaration (quoted in sub-section 7.2.1).\nThe PCSBI (2011) highlight the importance of ensuring that the design of clinical trials enables the researchers to resolve controversy and uncertainty over the merits of the trial drug and whether the trial drug is better than an existing drug if there is one. They suggest that studies which cannot resolve such questions or uncertainty are likely to be ignored by the scientific community and this would be unethical as it would mean that people had been unnecessarily exposed to risk without there being any social benefit.\nReasons for participation\nPeople with dementia who take part in clinical trials may do so for a variety of reasons. One possible reason is that they hope to receive some form of treatment that will improve their condition or even result in a cure. This is sometimes called the \u201ctherapeutic misconception\u201d. In such cases, clinical trials may seem unethical in that advantage is being taken of the vulnerability of some of the participants. On the other hand, the possibility of participating in such a trial may help foster hope which may even enable a person to maintain their morale.\nA review of 61 studies on attitudes to trials has shed some light on why people participate in clinical trials (Edwards, Lilford and Hewison, 1998). In this review, it was found that over 60% of participants in seven studies stated that they did or would participate in clinical trials for altruistic reasons. However, in 4 studies, over 70% of people stated that they participated out of self-interest and in two studies over 50% of people stated that they would participate in such a study out of self-interest. As far as informed consent is concerned, in two studies (which were also part of this review) 47% of responding doctors thought that few patients were actually aware that they were taking part in a clinical trial. On the other hand, an audit of four further studies revealed that at least 80% of participants felt that they had made an autonomous decision. There is no proof whether such perceptions were accurate or not. The authors conclude that self-interest was more common than altruism amongst the reasons given for participating in clinical trials but draw attention to the poor quality of some of the studies reviewed thereby suggesting the need for further research. It should not be necessary for people to justify why they are willing to participate in clinical trials. Reasons for participating in research are further discussed in section 3.2.4 insofar as they relate to end-of-life research.\nIn a series of focus groups organised in 8 European countries plus Israel and covering six conditions including dementia, helping others was seen as the main reason why people wanted to take part in clinical trials (Bartlam et al., 2010). In a US trial of anti-inflammatory medication in Alzheimer\u2019s disease in which 402 people were considered eligible, of the 359 who accepted, their main reasons for wanting to participate were altruism, personal benefit and family history of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nRandom assignment to study groups\nAs people are randomly assigned to the placebo or the active treatment group, everyone has an equal chance of receiving the active ingredient or whichever other control groups are included in the study. There are possible advantages and drawbacks to being in each group and people are likely to have preferences for being a particular study group but randomization means that allocation is not in any way linked to the best interests of each participant from a medical perspective. This is not an ethical issue provided that each participant fully understands that the purpose of research is not to provide a tailor-made response to an individual\u2019s medical condition and that while some participants benefit from participation, others do not.\nThere are, however, medical issues to consider. In the case in double-blind studies, neither the participant nor the investigator knows to which groups a participant has been allocated. Consequently, if a participant encounters medical problems during the study, it is not immediately known whether this is linked to the trial drug or another unrelated factor, but the problems must be addressed and possible contraindications avoided, which may necessitate \u201cde-blinding\u201d (DuBois, 2008).\nAlthough many people would perhaps like to benefit from a new drug which is more effective than existing drugs, people have different ideas about what is an acceptable risk and different reasons for taking part in clinical trials. People who receive the placebo are not exposed to the same potential risks as those given the experimental drug. On the other hand, they have no possibility to benefit from the advantages the drug may offer. Those receiving a drug commonly considered as the standard therapy are not necessarily better off than those receiving a placebo as some participants may already know that they do not respond well to the accepted treatment (DuBois, 2008).\nIf people who participate in a clinical trial are not informed which arm of the trial they were in, valuable information is lost which might have otherwise contributed towards to treatment decisions made after the clinical trial. Taylor and Wainwright (2005) suggest that \u201cunblinding\u201d should occur at the end of all studies and so as not to interfere with the analysis of data, this could be done by a person who is totally independent of the analysis. This would, however, have implications for open label extended trials as in that case participants, whilst better equipped to give informed consent would have more information than the researchers and this might be conveyed to researchers in anad hocmanner.\nOpen label extension trails\nOpen label extension studies (mentioned in sub-section 7.1.8) seem quite fair as they give each participant the opportunity to freely consent to continuing with the study in the full knowledge that s\/he will receive the experimental drug. However, Taylor and Wainwright (2005) have highlighted a couple of ethical concerns linked to the consent process, the scientific value of such studies and issues linked to access to drugs at the end of the prior study.\nWith regard to consent, they argue that people may have had a positive or negative experience of the trial but do not know whether this was due to the experimental drug, another drug or a placebo. They may nevertheless base their decision whether to continue on their experience so far. For those who were not taking the experimental drug, their experience in the follow-up trial may turn out to be very different. Also, if they are told about the possibility of the open label extension trial when deciding whether or not to take part in the initial trial (i.e. with the implication that whatever group they are ascribed to, in the follow-up study they will be guaranteed the experimental drug), this might induce them to participate in the initial study which could be considered as a form of subtle coercion. Finally, researchers may be under pressure to recruit as they can only recruit people in an open label extended trial who took part in the initial study. This may lead them in turn to put pressure (even inadvertently) on participants to continue with the study.\nThe scientific validity of open label extension trials is questioned by Taylor and Wainwright (2005) on the grounds that people from the experimental arm of the first study who did not tolerate the drug would be unlikely to participate in the extension trial and this would lead to bias in the results. In addition, open-label trials often lack a precise duration other than \u201cuntil the drug is licensed\u201d which casts doubt on there being a valid research purpose.\nThe above authors suggest that open label extension studies are dressed up marketing activities which lack the ethical justification for biomedical research which is the prospect of finding new ways of benefiting people\u2019s health. However, it could be argued that the aim of assessing long-term tolerability of a new drug is a worthwhile pursuit and if conducted in a scientific manner could be considered as research. Moreover, not all open label extension trials are open-ended with regard to their duration. The main problem in interpreting open label extension studies is that little is known about the natural course of the disease.\nProtecting participants\u2019 well-being at the end of the clinical trial\nSome people who participate in a clinical trial and who receive the experimental drug experience an improvement in their condition. This is to be hoped even if benefit to the health of individuals is not the aim of the study. However, at the end of the study, the drug is not yet licenced and there is no legal right to continue taking it. This could be psychologically disturbing to the participants in the trial and also to their families who may have seen a marked improvement in their condition.\nTaylor and Wainwright (2005) suggest that the open label trials may serve the purpose of prescribing an unlicensed drug on compassionate grounds, which whilst laudable, should not be camouflaged as scientific research. Rather governments should take responsibility and set up the appropriate legal mechanisms to make it possible for participants whose medical condition merits prolonged treatment with the experimental drug to have access to it.\nMinimising pain and discomfort\nCertain procedures to which people with dementia or their representatives consent may by burdensome or painful or simply worrying but in accordance with the principles of autonomy or justice\/equity, people with dementia have the right to participate. The fact that they have made an informed decision to participate and are willing to tolerate such pain or burden does not release researchers from the obligation to try to minimise it. For example, if repeated blood samples are going to be necessary, an indwelling catheter could be inserted under local anaesthetic to make it easier or medical staff should provide reassurance about the use of various scanning equipment which might be worrying or enable the person\u2019s carer to be present. In order to minimize fear, trained personnel are needed who have experience dealing with people with dementia. The advice of the carer, if there is one, could also be sought.\nDrug trials in countries with less developed safeguards\nClinical trials are sometimes carried out in countries where safeguards are not well developed and where the participants and even the general population are likely to have less possibility to benefit from the results of successful trials. For example, some countries have not signed the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine (1997) (referred to in section 188.8.131.52). The participants in those countries may be exposed to possible risks but have little chance of future medical benefit if the trial is successful. Yet people in countries with stricter safeguards for participants (which are often richer countries) stand to benefit from their efforts and from the risks they take, as they are more likely to be able to afford the drugs once developed. This raises ethical issues linked to voluntariness because there may be, in addition to the less developed safeguards, factors which make participation in such trials more attractive to potential participants. Such practices also represent a lack of equity in the distribution of risk, burden and possible benefit within society and could be interpreted as using people as a means to an end.\nParallels can also be drawn to the situation whereby people in countries where stem cell research is banned profit from the results of studies carried out in countries where it is permitted or to the results of studies carried out in countries where research ethics are slack or inexistent.\nFor a detailed discussion of the ethical issues linked to the involvement in research of people in other countries, particularly lower and middle income countries where standards of protection may by lower, please refer to the afore-mentioned report by the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues.\n- Researchers should consider including a placebo arm in clinical trials when there are compelling and sound methodological reasons for doing so.\n- Researchers should ensure that patients are aware that the aim of a randomised controlled trial is to test a hypothesis and provide generalizable knowledge leading to the development of a medical drug or procedure. They should explain how this differs from medical treatment and care which are aimed at enhancing the health and wellbeing of individual patients and where there is a reasonable expectation that this will be successful.\n- Researchers should ensure that potential participants understand that they may be allocated to the placebo group.\n- It should not be presumed that the treating doctor or contact person having proposed the participant for a trial has been successful in communicating the above information.\n- Researchers conducting clinical trials may need training in how to ensure effective communication with people with dementia.\n- Appropriate measures should be taken by researchers to minimize fear, pain and discomfort of participants.\n- All participants should, when possible, preferably have the option of receiving the experimental drug (if proven safe) after completion of the study.\n- Pharmaceutical companies should not be discouraged from carrying out open-label extension studies but this should not be the sole possibility for participants to access the trial drug after the end of the study if it is proving beneficial to them.\n- In multi-centre clinical trials, where data is transferred to another country in which data protection laws are perhaps less severe, the data should be treated as stated in the consent form signed by the participant.\nLast Updated: jeudi 29 mars 2012","id":"<urn:uuid:9d3f2101-f19c-4a5e-a7b4-dcd94a6d33f1>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.alzheimer-europe.org\/FR%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%EF%BF%BD%20%EF%BF%BD%C2%B3\/Ethics\/Ethical-issues-in-practice\/Ethics-of-dementia-research\/Clinical-trials","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9556197524,"token_count":6489,"score":3.640625,"int_score":4}

This civilization developed into highly structured kingdoms during the Classic Period, around 200-900 CE.

It started to decline around 900 CE when - for reasons which are still debated - the southern Maya abandoned their cities.

In the current spate of heat, the hottest day was January 4 when temperatures across the state averaged 41.2 degrees.\nUp until January 6, Yarrawonga had posted the hottest temperature in the state at 45.7 degrees on January 5, while Portland's 42.1 on the previous day was a new daily maximum for that location, the bureau said.\nNationwide, the hottest single temperature recorded during the heat - up to January 6 - has been the 48.6 degrees reached at Red Rocks Point in WA on Jauary 3. That's about 2 degrees below the 50.7 degrees all-time record set on January 2, 1960.","id":"<urn:uuid:23156681-3a82-4757-a6c9-f172faa662dd>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.hillsnews.com.au\/story\/1222764\/exceptional-heatwave-challenges-records\/?cs=2452","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.962593019,"token_count":751,"score":2.6875,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Elementary Matrices Generate the General Linear Group\nOkay, so we can use elementary row operations to put any matrix into its (unique) reduced row echelon form. As we stated last time, this consists of building up a basis for the image of the transformation the matrix describes by walking through a basis for the domain space and either adding a new, independent basis vector or writing the image of a domain basis vector in terms of the existing image basis vectors.\nSo let\u2019s say we\u2019ve got a transformation in . Given a basis, we get an invertible matrix (which we\u2019ll also call ). Then we can use elementary row operations to put this matrix into its reduced row echelon form. But now every basis vector gets sent to a vector that\u2019s linearly independent of all the others, or else the transformation wouldn\u2019t be invertible! That is, the reduced row echelon form of the matrix must be the identity matrix.\nBut remember that every one of our elementary row operations is the result of multiplying on the left by an elementary matrix. So we can take the matrices corresponding to the list of all the elementary row operations and write\nwhich tells us that applying all these elementary row operations one after another leads us to the identity matrix. But this means that the product of all the elementary matrices on the right is . And since we can also apply this to the transformation , we can find a list of elementary matrices whose product is . That is, any invertible linear transformation can be written as the product of a finite list of elementary matrices, and thus the elementary matrices generate the general linear group.","id":"<urn:uuid:cf863937-0ee5-440d-baec-55365a75d0fc>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/unapologetic.wordpress.com\/2009\/09\/04\/elementary-matrices-generate-the-general-linear-group\/?like=1&source=post_flair&_wpnonce=4ca8fc8c32","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9115640521,"token_count":345,"score":3.234375,"int_score":3}
