{"text":"Contemporary world politics make it necessary for nations to integrate into international unions in the interest of their own national security and economy. In these international unions, which are usually based upon geographic location, such factors as natural resources, trading blocs, and even cultural values play an important role. Many neighboring countries combine their resources under the auspices of such organizations, create defensive alliances, and cooperate on a wide array of issues. The goal of such unions is to preserve peace, control the arms race, resolve disputes through diplomacy, promote socioeconomic development, and protect fundamental human rights and democracy. At the present time, NATO, the OSCE, the EU, NAFTA, OPEC, ASEAN, the G-8, the D-8, and APEC are the foremost international political, military, and economic unions.\nThese institutions are subject to organizational reforms because of new members or a widening of scope. All of these organizations, formed in the aftermath of the Second World War, have contributed to creating stability and order in the world and have played a major role in global socioeconomic development. Member nations protect their economic and military interests, and also acquire a stronger regional and international position. Even the developed world perceives the necessity of such partnerships. The creation of free trade zones, regional trade agreements, abolished customs controls, and even a common currency (as in the EU) safeguard the future of member states. Defensive pacts enable member states to reduce military expenditures and to divert those resources to cultural and educational fields.\nA similar organization will provide considerable benefits to Muslim nations. For those that are desperate for technological as well as economic development, the foremost step toward stability is the creation of a central organization or, in other words, a unified Islamic world under the auspices of the Islamic Union.\nEconomic Development and Increasing Prosperity\nEconomic cooperation is necessary on two counts: stability and development. Muslim nations must bring stability and solidity to their economies. Developing industries and making the required investments is vital, as is the need for a comprehensive development plan and the simultaneous development of education, economy, culture, science, and technology. While various sectors are developed technologically, the labor force's educational levels and standards must be raised accordingly. Society must be motivated to become more productive, and the resulting economic cooperation will play a major role in eradicating poverty, illiteracy, the unjust distribution of wealth, and other socioeconomic problems rampant in Muslim countries. This partnership can be formed only by the creation of free trade zones, customs unions, and common economic areas.\nMost Muslim countries have geostrategic importance as well as rich natural resources (e.g., natural gas and crude oil). These resources and strategic opportunities, however, are not being used effectively. In the Islamic world, 86% of the population's living standards fall below $2,000, 76% under $1,000, and 67% under $500 per year. When the Islamic world's total resources are considered,(1) this is quite a paradox: Roughly half of the petrol consumed in the West is exported from the Islamic world, as is 40% of the world's agricultural production.(2) Many economists and strategists freely admit that the world economy depends upon the Islamic world's oil and gas exports, in particular those of the Persian Gulf.(3)\nThe Persian Gulf holds two-thirds of the planet's discovered crude oil reserves. Data obtained from research concludes that Saudi Arabia alone holds 25.4% of the world's oil reserves, or 262 billion barrels. A further 11% is found in Iraq, 9.6 % in the UAE, 9.2 % in Kuwait, 8.6 % in Iran, 13% in other OPEC member states. The rest is distributed across the remainder of the world.(4) Research commissioned by the U.S. Department of Energy shows that between 2000 and 2020, oil exports from the area will increase by 125%.(5) This means that the world will continue to meet most of its energy needs by imports from the Gulf region. Moreover, the Middle East has 40% of the global natural gas reserves; 35 % of these reserves are in the Gulf region.(6) Algeria, Libya, and other North African countries have 3.7 % of the world's reserves.\nThe Caucasus and Central Asia are also rich in oil, natural gas, and other natural resources. For instance, Kazakhstan has between 10-17.6 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, and its natural gas reserves are estimated at between 53 and 83 trillion cubic feet.\nTurkmenistan hasbetween 98 and 155 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves, making it the fourth largest producer.(7) Some other Muslim countries have valuable mineral resources. For instance, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan are two of the world's leading gold producers. Turkey has one of the world's richest boron reserves, only recently discovered to be very important, and Tajikistan has the world's largest aluminum producing facilities.\nThese advantages will become more important in the twenty-first century, which some have already christened the \"energy century.\" Energy is an essential element of modern society in terms of the military, industry, urbanization, and transport. Given that economic activity and manufacturing depend primarily upon energy, nations will do their best to achieve control over these energy resources. The Islamic world is not using its resources effectively, for many of its members lack the infrastructure and technology to increase the production and use their natural resources to develop their industries. Therefore, the resources' contributions to the country's economy are limited to export earnings. These countries do not have the means to process their own crude oil, use it in their industrial complexes, or to develop their industries. Worse still, some Muslim nations do not even have the necessary means to explore and research their natural resources or to discover and extract them. Explorations undertaken by foreign companies reveal that other Muslim nations have oil and gas reserves, but they cannot benefit from their resources.\nNaturally, the ineffective use of natural resources is not the Islamic world's only economic problem. However, solving this problem can begin the process of solving many other problems. The economies of Muslim nations contain differences in structure and functioning. Some nations' economies depend upon mineral resources, such as the members of OPEC, while other nations' depend upon agriculture. These differences are also reflected, to some extent, in their social structures, such as the widely varying degrees of rural and urban populations. Developing complementary relationships and helping each other in their respective areas of expertise can turn these differences into a source of riches. All of this will be possible with the Islamic Union.\nJoint ventures and project partnerships will be an important step in the right direction, for they will enable countries to benefit from one another's experiences and the income earned from investment projects will benefit all of the participating countries. Such mutual financial support is compatible with Islamic morality, for helping the needy and having a sense of social responsibility are important characteristics that Muslims strive to acquire. Many verses in the Qur\u2019an remind Muslims to watch over the needy.\nSociety's internal cohesion must be extended to international relations. As international cooperation within a partnership cannot be one-sided, employment and income levels will rise in both countries. For example, one country will produce oil and another one will process it, and agriculturally dependent countries will be able to import the food they need from agriculturally developed countries. A manpower-poor country\u2019s need will be met by another Islamic country, while rich countries will be able to invest in and help out a manpower-rich country that does not have enough jobs for its people. This will be to the benefit of both. Sharing know-how and experience will increase prosperity, and all Muslims will benefit from technological developments.\nJoint ventures that realize the Islamic world's unification of opportunities and means will enable Muslims to produce hi-tech products. The Islamic common market will enable Muslim-made products to be marketed in other Muslim countries without the hindrance of customs, quotas, and other cross-border obstacles. The marketplace will grow, the market share and exports of all Muslim nations will rise, industrialization will speed up, and economic development will bring progress in technology. The living standards and wealth of Muslim nations will increase, and their existing inequalities will disappear. Some free trade agreements are already in place between countries in the Gulf, the Pacific Rim, and North Africa. Trade agreements signed by Turkey are already operational in the Islamic world. Bilateral cooperation exists in some regions; however, their scope must be widened. Such cooperation will safeguard the rights and interests of all Muslim nations and lead to all of them becoming developed\u2014a result from which all of them will derive a far greater benefit than if they do not cooperate with each other.\nAll of these can be realized only under a central authority's leadership and coordination. Achieving this will be possible if Muslim nations adopt the Qur'an's values and the Prophet's (May God bless him and grant him peace) Sunnah, or, in other words, if they adopt Islamic culture. The Islamic Union must lead the way to this cultural awakening, as well as the resulting political and economic cooperation.\nMutual cooperation among Muslims, part of the Islamic code, must be adhered to by all Muslims, for God commands people to refrain from avarice and to guard the needy and support one another. In fact, destitute people have a due share of the believers' wealth (Qur'an, 51:19). As the Qur'an proclaims:\nOur Lord also reveals that believers are one another's guardians (Qur'an, 9:71). The word \"guardian\" conveys such meanings as friend, helper, mentor, and protector. It also expresses the importance of cooperation and solidarity between Muslim nations. The cooperation that will arise from this fraternal awareness between Muslim nations will bring prosperity and wealth to Muslims and eradicate poverty, an important problem of the Islamic world. Societies that follow the Qur'an's values will not experience famine, destitution, and poverty. Muslims will develop their nations by following rational and long-term policies, establishing good relations with other nations and people, valuing trade and development, and learning from other cultures' experiences. This was so in history and, God willing, under the Islamic Union's leadership it will be so once again.\n1- Demetrios Yiokaris, Islamic Leage Study Guide-1997, United Nations: Study Guides.

{"text":"The most illustrious Czars and mighty Princes, John and Peter Alexewitz, my most gracious Lords, having in their Wise Council of State resolved to send a splendid Embassy, on some important affairs, to the Great Bogdaichan, or Sovereign of the famous Kingdom of Kitai, by us Europeans commonly called China: This obliged me with a welcoming opportunity of traveling through part of the famous, but hitherto unknown, Siberian and Kitaian Countries, (never before visited by any German) and informing my self by credible witnesses of the remainder of those Lands, as well as obtaining a certain knowledge of several things with which the World hath not been hitherto acquainted.\nEvert Ysbrants Ides was the first educated European to travel in Siberia and gather firsthand information about the collection of fossil ivory. Ides' opportunity to travel across Siberia was the direct result of the satisfactory settlement of a small war on the Chinese border.\nThe speed with which the first wave of Russian fur traders, called promyshleniki, crossed Siberia created serious supply problems for them. Men carrying small loads of goods and supplies could easily cross Siberia using a network of rivers and short portages by boat in the summer and sled in the winter. Bringing large loads of bulky goods, specifically enough grain to feed a small settlement, was a much more difficult and expensive proposition. It could take three or four years for a shipment of grain to reach a remote place like Yakutsk and, by then, the majority of the load would be inedible. Because of this, the promyshleniki were relieved and excited when they began to hear rumors of the Amur, a valley in the south filled with grain, cattle, and silver.\nThe first expedition to reach the Amur was a group of 132 cossacks under Vassily Poiarkov in 1643-46. The Amur natives, whom the Russians called Daurians, greeted Poiarkov with hospitality but the relationship turned sour as the Russians resorted to kidnapping, plunder, and, it is reputed, cannibalism to get what they wanted. This kind of behavior went over with the locals about as well as you might expect. Poiarkov had to fight his way out of the country and lost half of his command to native attacks and starvation. However, because he confirmed that the Amur was a land of cattle and grain (he didn't find any silver), the expedition was proclaimed a success. Several other Russians tried to map out a better route into the Amur valley. In 1651, Yerofey Khabarov fought his way down the river with even more brutality than Poiarkov had and built a fort near the site of the city that now bears his name. This is when things began to go to hell.\nKhabarov knew, but chose to ignore, that the Amur was within the Chinese sphere of influence. What he might not have known was that it was also part of the homeland of the new Qing dynasty of China. The only reason he was able to occupy as much land as he did was that most of the armed Manchu horsemen were still busy conquering China. A year after Khabarov built Achansk, a Chinese military expedition arrived to drive him out of the valley. This was the beginning of more than thirty years of seesawing occupation of the Amur country. By the early eighties, with most of China finally pacified, the Kangxi emperor was ready to deal with the Russians once and for all. Now it was the turn of Moscow to get alarmed.\nMoscow, in the 1680s, was infected with a bad case of \"who's in charge here?\" In April 1682, Tsar Fedor III died at the tender age of twenty one without leaving an heir. The succession fell on his brothers Ivan and Peter. The elder of the two, Ivan, was severely epileptic, nearly blind, and may have suffered from a variety of other problems (diagnosing the physical and mental health of historical figures is more of a parlor game than a science among historians). Peter was strong as an ox, but only ten years old. To further complicate matters, the two boys had different mothers and the two sets of in-laws formed powerful and antagonistic factions at court. Fedor's death was followed by a week of riot and rebellion (not all of which was related to the succession). When the dust cleared, Ivan and Peter had been declared co-tsars and their sister Sophia was the de facto regent ruling in their names.\nExcept for a few years during the reign of Catherine the Great, historians have not been kind to Sophia. She has been reduced to cartoonish stereotype of a scheming woman (which is bad) who was finally put back in her place by a strong male (which is good). In fact, Sophia Alexeevna Romanov was an extraordinary woman. She was intelligent, well informed, and literate in three languages. She was comfortable giving orders and appearing in public at a time when most upper-class Russian women were kept in harem-like seclusion for their entire lives. During the seven years that she served as regent for the two tsars, Sophia had successes and failures no different than any other rulers\u2019. For the advance of mammoth knowledge, her most important achievement was settling the Amur conflict.\nSince the beginning of the century, the tsars had recognized the potential for Siberia to become a private trade route to China, but every attempt at making official contact with the Chinese court had failed due to cultural misunderstandings. Despite that, the Kangxi emperor wanted to open trade with the Russians and hoped that a show of strength would be enough to drive the promyshleniki and Cossacks out of the Amur valley. In 1684 a large and well supplied Chinese army arrived on the lower Amur and began to move west driving the Russians before them. At Albazin, on the northern bend of the Amur, the Russians attempted to make a stand, but were soon defeated. The Chinese allowed the survivors to retreat, razed their fort, and moved down river to their base of operations. When word of the defeat on the Amur reached Sophia and her advisors, they quickly dispatched an envoy to make peace with the Chinese.\nThis should have been the end of the crisis, but, before the envoy could arrive, the Siberian Russians returned to Albazin and built a new fort provoking the Chinese army to return and start a new siege. They were only saved by the arrival in Beijing of advance messengers from the embassy. The Kangxi emperor ordered his army to lift the siege and prepared his own diplomatic mission to meet the Russians. Further complications--and there are always further complications in diplomacy--delayed the meeting of the two missions until the summer of 1689. The negotiation took place at the Russian outpost of Nerchinsk on a tributary of the Amur almost 300 miles west of Albazin. Amid elaborate ceremonies by the official heads of the missions, the real negotiations were carried out in Latin by a Polish cavalry officer (for the Russians) and a French Jesuit (for the Chinese). The agreement, signed on August 27, the first formal treaty signed between China and a Western power, required the Russians to evacuate the entire Amur valley, but established formal trade through Nerchinsk.\nSophia did not get to celebrate the Treaty of Nerchinsk. At the same time that the negotiations were wrapping up in the East, Sophia's regency was coming to an abrupt and unanticipated end in Moscow. Sophia's position had been dramatically weakened by two disastrous campaigns in the Crimea and by her half brother Peter turning seventeen in June. Amid rumors that Sophia was planning to murder Peter and rule in her own name, supporters of the two Romanovs engaged in a month of dramatic maneuvers that resulted in Peter taking control and Sophia retiring to a convent. Peter's half brother Ivan stayed on as co-tsar until his natural death seven years later.\nWhen word of the treaty reached Peter, he accepted the terms and began planning a trade mission to Beijing. Russia had a severe shortage of literate agents who were competent to make their way through foreign cultures, which explains the necessity of hiring Latin speaking Polish cavalry officers to conduct delicate diplomatic negotiations. For his first official trade mission to China, Peter hired a German, Dutch, or possibly Danish merchant named Evert Ysbrants Ides*. Ides had been in Russia since 1677, operating his own merchant house, first in Archangel and later in Moscow. In the spring of 1692, Ides left Moscow at the head of a 400 man caravan with instructions to exchange ratifications of the treaty, determine the best items for trade, feel out official attitudes toward the treaty, and request that a Chinese envoy be sent to Moscow.\nThe most direct route from Moscow to China is the same one that the Trans-Siberian Railway follows today, around the southern end of the Ural Mountains, across the steppe lands at the center of Eurasia, across Lake Baikal, and on to the Amur. Unfortunately, the steppe lands were controlled by Kirghiz nomads and unsafe for Russian merchants. For this reason, Ides' caravan had to take a much more roundabout path to Baikal that took them across the Urals on the same path as Ermak a century before, down the Irtysh River to its junction with the Ob, up the Ob and its tributary the Ket, to a portage into the Yenisei basin, and up the Angara River to Baikal. By October, the mission had only reached the way station of Makofskoi on the Ket portage. It was here that Ides had had his encounter with fossil mammoths.\nAmongst the hills, which are situate North-East of [Makofskoi], and not far from hence, the Mammuts Tongues and Legs are found; as they are also particularly on the Shores of the Rivers Jenize, Trugan [Lower Tunguska], Mongamsea [Taz], Lena, and near Jakutskoi [Yakutsk], even as far as the Frozen Sea. ... I had a Person with me to China, who had annually went out in search of these Bones; he told me, as a certain truth, that he and his Companions found the Head of one of these Animals, which was discovered by the fall of such a frozen piece of Earth. As soon as he opened it, he found the greatest part of the Flesh rotten, but it was not without difficulty that they broke out his Teeth, which were placed before his Mouth, as those of the Elephants are; they also took some Bones out of his head, and afterwards came to his Fore-foot, which they cut off, and, carried part of it to the City of Trugan [Turukhansk], the Circumference of it being as large as that of the wast of an ordinary Man. The Bones of the Head appeared somewhat red, as tho' they were tinctured with Blood.\nThis account by Ides is the first Western description of a frozen mammoth and the beginning of a scientific and popular fascination that hasn't ended over three hundred years later.\nLocating the mammoth to which Ides' unnamed traveling companion referred is a little tricky. Makofskoi was, and still is, a small town on the western end of the portage between the Ob and Yenisei Rivers. Ides gave no indication of how far he meant when he said mammoth remains were found in the hills to the Northeast. My conclusion, based on Ides' phrase \"not far from hence,\" is that the find must have been close to Makofskoi. The explorer Adolf Nordenskiold, who traveled along the Arctic coast in the late nineteenth century, thought, because the hunter took the mammoth's foot to Turukhansk, that the find must have been close to that place. Turukhansk is 450 miles north of Makofskoi, which is not \"not far from hence.\" In Ides' day there were two major towns on the Yenesei where his companion might have sold the ivory, Turukhansk and Yeneseisk, which is only eighty miles from Makofskoi. That argues in Nordenskiold's favor. If the find was closer to Yeneseisk the only reasons the hunter would have had for going all the way to Turukhansk would have been if Turukhansk was offering a better price for ivory or if he had other business there. Without more evidence there's no way to settle the matter. If we split the difference between Makofskoi and Turukhansk we arrive at the Stony Tunguska River. Maybe the site was blown up in 1908 by the Tunguska meteorite.\nIdes goes on to report what the locals believed about the remains.\nConcerning this Animal there are very different reports. The Heathens of Jakuti, Tungusi, and Ostiacki, say that they continually, or at least, by reason of the very hard Frosts, mostly live under ground, where they go backwards and forwards; to confirm which they tell us, That they have often seen the Earth heaved up when one of these Beasts was on the March, and after he was past, the place sink in, and thereby make a deep Pit. They further believe, that if this Animal comes so near to the surface of the frozen Earth as to smell, or discern the Air, he immediately dies, which they say is the reason that several of them are found dead, on the high Banks of the River, where they unawares came out of the Ground. This is the opinion of the Infidels concerning these Beasts, which are never seen.\nBut the old Siberian Russians affirm, that the Mammuth is very like the Elephant, with this only difference, that the Teeth of the former are firmer, and not so straight as those of the latter. They also are of Opinion, that there were Elephants in this Country before the Deluge, when this Climate was warmer, and that their drowned bodies floating on the Surface of the Water of that Flood, were at last wash'd and forced into Subterranean Cavities...\nThe description of the mammoth as a subterranean animal that dies on exposure to surface air is almost identical to that given by the Chinese writer Tung-fang So in the second century BC.\nThe three \"heathen\" tribes that Ides mentions are names given by the Russian conquerors and used to lump together all of the peoples of the Lower Irtysh, Ob, Yenisei, and Lena river basins. That is to say, he was ascribing the belief in the mammoth as a giant mole to most of the people of Western and Central Siberia. Later travelers ascribed different beliefs to many of these peoples. Still other travelers confirmed Ides' observations. When Ides traveled across Siberia, most of these peoples had been under Russian rule for a century, giving them plenty of time to have heard about the ideas of tribes with which they had had very little contact and to have learned the Biblical stories of Noah and Behemoth. Today, it is virtually impossible to sort out which tribes believed what before their contact with the Russians.\nWhile Ides was the first educated European to travel in Siberia and report firsthand information on the collection of fossil ivory, he wouldn't be the last. Peter the Great's diplomacy, wars, economic needs, and personal curiosity would send a constant stream of educated Europeans into his Eastern realms. They in turn would send back a constant stream of information that would be eagerly consumed by a Europe that was looking at the world through an increasingly scientific lens.\nHmmm. I still seem to be having trouble with that \"keep your blog posts under a thousand words\" thing. Oh well...\n* Ides nationality and name have been the source of much confusion over the years. Accounts of his journey describe him variously as Dutch, German, and Danish. In the opening quote he implies that he considers himself to be German, but the first edition of his book was published in Dutch. The confusion comes from the fact that his parents were Dutch immigrants to Holstein, a German-speaking province that is the home of many cows and was then ruled by the King of Denmark. It's likely that Ides was fluent in both German and Dutch.\nThe possible spellings given for his first and middle names are even more varied than his nationality. Because his middle name is sometimes spelled Ysbrand, some writers have assumed that he and the mission's secretary, Adam Brand, were one person. Adding to that confusion was the fact that both of them published memoirs of the journey, which the same writers who thought they were the same person assumed were merely different editions of the same book. They weren't, it wasn't, and that's that.","id":"<urn:uuid:53e8bab9-3a15-4496-a8db-400a8f03146a>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/johnmckay.blogspot.com\/2009\/03\/fragments-of-my-research-viii.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9845748544,"token_count":3506,"score":2.828125,"int_score":3}

{"text":"There's this kid who gets bullied a lot by everyone. What should I do?\nHooray for the person who sent this question in to us! There are a lot more kids who witness bullying than there are victims of bullying. Often, people who see something happen are called bystanders. Wouldn't it be excellent if those bystanders would do something to help someone who's being bullied?\nBut how exactly do you find your courage and do it?\nFirst, be sure to let an adult know what's going on. If it's happening at school, have a talk with a teacher or school counselor about it. If it happens at camp, the camp counselor is the one to talk to. Approach the adult and say you need to talk. Explain what's been going on the best you can. Give details. The adult can take steps to stop the bullying.\nPlus, once they know about bullying, adults can do things to help the kid who's been bullied feel better and stronger. Adults can also help the kid who bullies learn to treat others with respect, friendship, and kindness.\nAfter talking to an adult, here are some other things you can do. Be friendly to the kid who gets bullied. For example, say \"hi\" at the lockers or bus line, include that kid at your lunch table, or invite the kid to play at recess or to be in your group for a project. This helps for two reasons:\nAny kid who gets bullied is likely to feel left out and alone. Your friendship helps that kid feel included and welcome.\nFriendship also helps prevent bullying because bullies are less likely to pick on kids when they are with friends.\nAnd when you see the bully acting mean, you can say, \"Hey, knock it off, that's not cool,\" and invite the kid who's being picked on to walk away with you. You can just say, \"C'mon, let's go.\" This can work even better if you get a couple of your friends to join you in standing up for the kid. Tell your friends ahead of time: \"I'm going to stick up for that kid. Will you do it with me?\"\nBe sure to update the adult about what's going on until the problem is solved. This is also a very good thing to talk to parents about. Your parent will want to know about all this and can give you more advice and support. Plus, your mom or dad will be proud that you're the kind of kid who cares and who stands up for others and for what's right!\nBullying makes kids feel terrible \u2014 and not just the kid who's being bullied. Just seeing someone else be bullied makes others feel bad. That's because meanness affects everyone in the environment.

{"text":"|Time period||c. 400\u2013?|\n[a] The Semitic origin of the Brahmic scripts is not universally agreed upon.Note: This page may contain IPA phonetic symbols.\nThe Gupta script (sometimes referred to as Gupta Brahmi Script or Late Brahmi Script ) was used for writing Sanskrit and is associated with the Gupta Empire of India which was a period of material prosperity and great religious and scientific developments. The Gupta script was descended from Brahmi and gave rise to the Nagari, Sharada and Siddham scripts. These scripts in turn gave rise to many of the most important scripts of India, including Devanagari (the most common script used for writing Sanskrit since the 19th century), the Gurmukhi script for Punjabi Language and the Tibetan script.\nOrigins and Classification \nThe Gupta Script was descended from the Ashokan Brahmi script, and is a crucial link between Brahmi and most other scripts in the Brahmic family of Scripts, a family of alphasyllabaries or abugidas. This means that while only consonantal phonemes have distinct symbols, vowels are marked by diacritics, with \/a\/ being the implied pronunciation when the diacritic is not present. In fact, the Gupta script works in exactly the same manner as its predecessor and successors, and only the shapes and forms of the graphemes and diacritics are different.\nThrough the 4th century, letters began to take more cursive and symmetric forms, as a result of the desire to write more quickly and aesthetically. This also meant that the script became more differentiated throughout the Empire, with regional variations which have been broadly classified into three, four or five categories; however, a definitive classification is not clear, because even on a single inscription, there may be variation in how a particular symbol is written. In this sense, the term Gupta script should be taken to mean any form of writing derived from the Gupta period, even though there may be a lack of uniformity in the scripts.\nThe surviving inscriptions of the Gupta script are mostly found on iron or stone pillars, and on gold coins from the Gupta Dynasty. One of the most important was the Allahabad Prasasti. Composed by Harishena, the court poet and minister of Samudragupta, it describes Samudragupta\u2019s reign, beginning from his ascension to the throne as the second king of the Gupta Dynasty and including his conquest of other kings.\nGupta Numismatics \nThe study of Gupta coins began with the discovery of a hoard of gold coins in 1783. Many other such hoards have since been discovered, the most important being the Bayana hoard, discovered in 1946, which contained more than 2000 gold coins issued by the Gupta Kings. Many of the Gupta Empire\u2019s coins bear inscriptions of legends or mark historic events. In fact, it was one of the first Indian Empires to do so, probably as a result of its unprecedented prosperity. Almost every Gupta king issued coins, beginning with its first king, Chandragupta I.\nThe scripts on the coin are also of a different nature compared to scripts on pillars, due to conservatism regarding the coins that were to be accepted as currency, which would have prevented regional variations in the script from manifesting on the coinage. Moreover, space was more limited especially on their silver coins, and thus many of the symbols are truncated or stunted. An example is the symbol for \/ta\/ and \/na\/, which were often simplified to vertical strokes.\n- (Spanish) The Gupta Alphabet\n- AncientScripts.com entry on the Gupta Script\n- The Shivlee Collection of Coins from the Gupta Dynasty In particular, note the limited space on the silver coins\n- An eastern variety of the post-Gupta script: Ak\u1e63ara List of theManuscripts of the M\u016blamadhyamakak\u0101rik\u0101 and Buddhap\u0101lita's Commentary, c. the 550-650, Collection of Sanskrit Mss.

{"text":"A reading for Cultural Anthropology\nby Walter Trobisch\n(adapted from Readings in Missionary Anthropology II, edited by William Smalley. Used under the educational \"fair use\" provision of the 1976 U.S. Copyright Acts.)\n\"Jesus took the man aside, away from the crowd ... and said to him 'Be opened.' With that his ears were opened, and at the same time the impediment was removed.\" (Mark 7:33-35)\nWhat we need is a message tailored for each individual. In a concrete situation, general principles alone are not enough. Let us therefore take three people aside -- away from the crowd. Let us try to help them and take responsibility for them as a congregation. All three of them are real persons. They come from three different African countries, thousands of miles apart, but I shall not tell you from which countries and I have changed their names. They have given me permission to use their cases as an example, so I am not breaking their confidence.\nJoseph is a 26-year-old teacher at a mission school. I never met him, but we corresponded for almost three years. He wrote me after he had read my book I Loved a Girl:Three years ago I married a 15 year-old person. I have ten years of schooling, my wife only six. God blessed us one year ago with a baby. I purposely did not choose a. girl with a higher level of education, for I intended to educate my wife in order that she become exactly as I wanted her to be in her work and cleanliness, in her whole life. But she does not satisfy me any more with her obedience. She does not do what I command her to do. If I insist, we quarrel. I ask you for a solution to save this young marriage.\nIn order to help Joseph we have to understand his way of thinking. For him, marriage is an alliance with an inferior being. For him, a woman is primarily a garden. Man is then primarily the bearer of the seed of life. Such is their mutual destiny. Their destiny decides their function. Their function defines their relationship. According to this conception the woman can never be as important as the man, any more than the soil can be as important as the seed. By her very nature, she is secondary, auxiliary. This is the root of all discrimination between man and woman that has shaped the history of mankind, not only in Africa, but also in Asia and -- until recently -- in Europe and America. This conception of marriage is not only based on a wrong and inaccurate biology. It is also not in accordance with the New Testament which conceives of husband and wife as equal partners before God.\nMy task was to change Joseph's image of marriage. Here is my answer:Joseph, you have not married a wife. You have married a daughter. You were looking for a maid, obedient to your commandments. She was 15 when you married her. Now she is 18. In these three years she has developed from a girl to a young woman. In addition she has become a mother. This has changed her personality completely. She wants to be treated as a person. She wants to become your partner . . . It strikes me that your quarreling started after God gave you a baby. How long is the period of lactation in your tribe? Could it be that your quarreling has a deeper reason? It is not God's will for a married couple to abstain from physical union for such a long time.Joseph's answer came quickly:You are exactly right . . . It is true that we abstain from sex relations for two years after the birth of a child ... This habit is incorporated in us. Otherwise we are afraid of losing the baby, especially if the mother breast-feeds it and if it is a boy .. . My father - in - law pointed this out to me when our child was born.\nThe practice of abstaining from sex relations during the period of lactation presupposes a polygamous society. According to the biological conception of marriage, a man can have several gardens to be planted one after the other. A garden can have one proprietor only, Joseph wants to be a Christian. He has been taught by his church that polygamy is sin. But he has been left with this negative message. He has not received any positive advice on how to live with one wife as a partner, nor has he been told how to space his children.\nIt is interesting that Joseph did not confide his problem to his pastor. Evidently he did not expect any help from the pastor. Still, Joseph looks for a counselor. He may find that counselor in a questionable friend, maybe one that is not even a Christian, and he may be advised to do things which are poison for his marriage. The method our couple uses for spacing their children -- complete abstention -- will lead to an estrangement and husband and wife will slowly drift apart.\nLet us imagine that Joseph would have tried to solve his problem by taking a second wife. It is evident that refusing him communion as punishment for this action would have been the most inadequate answer to his problem on how to space his children. What is needed in Africa are not church disciplinarians, but marriage counselors.\nIn this case had Joseph not gone ahead and simply taken a second wife, but confided his intention to his pastor, explaining his motive, would his pastor have been able to help? Would the pastor have received enough training in this respect at the seminary? When a Christian takes a second wife, it is mostly due to the fact that his congregation has not carried responsibility for him.\nIt is unkind and merciless if missionaries condemn polygamy as sin, but keep silent to Africans about methods of conception control which they themselves use. It is even more so because a missionary usually has powdered milk at his disposal while an African villager does not.\nLet us imagine another possibility. Maybe Joseph did not take a second wife, but secretly had sexual relations with an unknown girl, or even the wife of another man. In other words, he had committed adultery. Now, since he wants to be a Christian, his conscience hurts him. What could he have done? Would he have found someone in your congregation to whom he could have gone, confessed his sin and received the absolution? If he had come to you, whether you are a pastor or not, would you have known what to do?\nWhat is needed in Africa are not ex-communicators but confessors who are keep the secret of confession absolute. What kind of training do our pastors receive in this respect? Here is the heart of the congregational responsibility for the individual. The offer of private confession is probably the most helpful contribution the Lutheran Church could make to the African churches as a whole. Martin Luther said: \"No one knows what private confession can do for him, except he who has struggled much with the devil. Yes the devil would have slain me long ago, if the confession would not have sustained me.\"\nIt is also possible that Joseph would not have dared to confess, but maybe you would have heard anyway about his sin. Then it would have been your duty to go to him. Responsibility for the individual means to take the initiative. Just as God has taken the initiative in Jesus Christ and has spoken to us without our inviting Him, so we have to take the initiative and talk to our brother, even if he does not ask us. This is \"church discipline\" according to the New Testament. \"Go ye therefore ...\" not to put him out of the church but to win him back to Jesus Christ (Matthew 18:15; 2 Thessalonians 3:15; 2 Timothy 2:25). Church discipline means to go and to win, not to wait and to judge.\nThere is not time to report the case of Joseph in full. The relationship between him and his wife improved after I informed him about other methods of conception control. Later on a new problem arrived. The family moved from the village to town. While living in the village Joseph's wife had fed her family from that which she had grown in her own garden. But in town she did not have a garden. She had to go shopping. Joseph had to give her money, which had rarely happened before.\nHere is Joseph's letter:Tell me how to make up a family budget and how to convince a woman -- however idiotic she may be -- to keep it. Most of the time my wife buys things which we don't need and then they spoil.I made up a detailed monthly budget according to Joseph's income and included as one item, \"pocket money for each one of you.\" Joseph wrote:My wife was very happy about it. After we had divided up the money, she was frank enough to tell me also the criticisms which she had in her heart about my spending habits. She was overwhelmed by joy to see the item, \"pocket money for each one of you.\"\nThis was, after almost three years of correspondence, the first time that Joseph had reported to me a reaction of his wife. The fact that he had shared my letter with her, that he even listened to her reproaches, but above all the fact that he gave her spending money, shows that his marriage had grown from a patriarchal pattern where the husband-father dominates his wife, into a marriage of partnership. A garden cannot rejoice and talk. One cannot listen to a garden. Joseph's wife had changed from a garden to a person. She had become a wife.\nFormerly, the course of life was channeled. The individual made very few decisions on his own. The road was marked by customs and traditions. This had changed now. The individual has to make up his mind about many things which formerly were decided by the family and the group. But -- as the case of Joseph and his wife shows -- the individual is not trained to make these decisions. Counseling therefore becomes indispensable. It belongs to the responsibility of the congregation. It is the service which the Christian church must give in a situation of social change.\nThe work of the counselor can be compared best of all with \"swimming.\" The time is past when a counselor could stand on a solid hilltop and give prefabricated rules and commandments to the counselee. The counselor has to descend from the hilltop and go into the water. Counselor and counselee have to swim together. With this picture of \"swimming\" in mind, the fact of uncertainty is expressed. At the outset the counselor may be more in need of advice than his counselee. But he swims together with him, trying to make. out beforehand the whirlpools and the rapids, the islands and the riverbanks. For a limited time, while exploring the situation for clarification and solutions, the counselor becomes the partner of his counselee. God is in this situation and the counselor has to find his will together with the counselee. Only what the latter is able and willing to accept and put into practice will help him.\nThe development of Joseph's marriage during the time of our correspondence proves that marriage guidance by letter can be fruitful. It may even be easier to confide the most intimate problems to a complete stranger. Because of the long distances and the lack of trained counselors, marriage guidance by mail has great promise in Africa, all the more because a personal letter there is highly treasured. It gives the receiver the experience of \"being taken aside, away from the crowd,\" to have his impediment removed.\nMarriage guidance is not only a counseling task. It is also a missionary opportunity. Since marriage is part of practical Christian living, the Christian marriage counselor has the possibility of proclaiming the Gospel to non-Christians along with the advice he gives. Marriage has become the problem of life today. People of all confessions, religions, classes and races are interested in it. Every heathen, Muslim or Communist will listen to those who have something useful to say about marriage. As Christians, I believe we do have something useful to say. But, do we say it? Or is the church in possession of a treasure of knowledge and wisdom and is keeping it locked up instead of handing it out?\nElsie is a high school student and the daughter of a \"minister of religion\" as she calls it. I know her too only by letter. She wrote to me and asked: \"How can I meet a Christian boy?\" I advised her to attend church. There she could meet boys.\nHere is her answer:The old people in our churches don't want boys to meet girls, not even to talk to them in their presence. Always the Sunday service begins by speaking against boys and girls. This has turned away most of the boys and girls from attending church. The other day the pastor said: \"If any boy has written to you a letter, return it to him and tell him never to write to you any letter.\"I answered, but for a long time did not hear from Elsie. Later I learned that her school principal had confiscated my letter. I was not on the list of men with whom she was allowed to correspond. So my letter went to her parents, who lived in a small village hundreds of miles away from her school. It took three months before the permission came and my letter was handed over to Elsie.\nFinally she wrote again:I have met a boy who is not of my tribe. He is a keen Christian and a student in a secondary school. It appears to me as if he would make a good husband according to the direction in your book I Loved a Girl. I went home and talked to my parents about him. They said they would not allow me to marry from any other tribe apart from mine. They claim that men from my boyfriend's tribe are going about with other women, even if they are married. I have tried to tell them that not all men from that tribe are bad, but they insist on my marrying someone from my own tribe. Since we are told that we should honor our parents, I cannot do something which is against their will. To make it worse: I do not live at home. I know very few boys from my own tribe. Seeing that this boy is interested in me, should I disregard my parents' advice?\nIn my answer I advised Elsie to take her boyfriend home once and present him to her parents so that they could meet him as a person. If she is certain about God's will for her marriage, she should obey God more than men.\nElsie's answer:My parents have become impossible. They cannot approve the choice I have made. They say they have heard rumors that the man I have chosen was misbehaving at college. But ever since I met him, he has never showed me any nonsense. I have decided to remain single for the whole of my life, unless I can marry him.Marriage between two Christians must be based on mutual trust and confidence. Confidence demands free choice. Free choice demands opportunities where young people can meet in a healthy atmosphere without suspicion. It belongs to the responsibility of the congregation to provide such opportunities. Many marriage problems in Africa have their root in the fact that the couple never had time and opportunity to really meet and get acquainted before marriage.\nMany African boys and girls have a list with names of a limited number of persons with whom they correspond. In a society where the meeting of the sexes is still difficult, also for outward reasons, we have to recognize that letter-writing as a means to establish contacts, can be a good one. Instead of intercepting mail, schools should rather teach criteria of how to evaluate a letter and give helpful instructions for answering.\nElsie's case reflects two areas of conflict. There is the conflict between the younger and older generation. Dealing with parents, uncles and grandparents is probably the thorniest problem of a marriage counselor in Africa. It has been overlooked that, in a fast-changing society, the education of the older generation is also a responsibility of the congregation. The church may have to speak out on the rules of exogamy (the tradition forcing a young man to find a bride outside a defined group of relatives) or endogamy (reversely, the rule that a bride can only be found within a close core of relatives.) Once a young African wrote me that he had 11,000 girls (\"sisters\") in his tribe which he could not marry. Unfortunately, he had fallen in love with one of them.\nThere is also the conflict between individual freedom and the obligation to tradition and family. Elsie has new possibilities of choice, unknown to her parents. She is caught between (1) making use of this freedom and (2) submission to rules originating from customs no longer relevant to her situation. Like Joseph, she is in need of personal counseling in her new freedom.\nHer decision to renounce this freedom and the wish of her heart, even against the advice of her counselors, poses lots of questions:\n- If you had been her counselor, what would you have advised her to do?\n- Assuming that God called Elsie to stay single, would it be possible for her to put this' decision into practice?\n- Does our church have a message for single girls?\n- What would be the responsibility of her congregation for her?\n- Is the decision against individual freedom and for submission to tradition always God's will?\n- Where are the limitations of the fourth commandment?\n- What is behind the attitude of her parents? (Her father is a pastor !)\n- How far here is also the \"biological\" conception of marriage at work?\n- Will they be pleased by her \"obedience\" or rather be shocked that their \"garden\" shall never be planted?\n- What could be done to help her parents to better understand their daughter?\nElsie's case is an encouraging one. She has character. She proves that one of the oncoming generation of African girls is able to make up her mind by herself instead of being pushed around and dominated. She is on her way to mature womanhood. Africa's future will depend upon this growth. There will be no free nations, unless there are free couples. There will be no free couples unless the wife grows into true partnership with her husband. It is the responsibility of the congregation to help toward such growth. It is the solution for Joseph's case as much as for Elsie's and even for our next case.\nOn one trip, I worshipped in an African church where nobody knew me. After the service I talked to two boys.\n\"How many brothers and sisters do you have?\" I asked the first one.\n\"Are they all from the same stomach?\"\n\"Yes, my father is a Christian.\"\n\"How about you?\" I addressed the other boy.\nHe hesitated. In his mind he was adding up. I know immediately that he came from a polygamous family.\n\"We are nine,\" he finally said.\n\"Is your father a Christian?\"\nNo,\" was the typical answer, \"he is a polygamist.\"\n\"Are you baptized?\"\n\"Yes, and my brothers and sister too,\" he added proudly.\n\"And their mothers?\"\n\"They are all three baptized, but only the first wife takes communion.\"\n\"Take me to your father.\"\nThe boy led me to a compound with many individual houses. It breathed cleanliness, order and wealth. Each wife had her own house and her own kitchen. The father -- a middle-aged, good-looking man, tall, fat and impressive -- received me without embarrassment and with apparent joy. Omodo, as we shall call him, was well-educated, wide awake and intelligent, with a sharp wit and a rare sense of humor. From the outset, he made no apologies for being a polygamist. He was proud of it. Here's the essential content of our conversation which lasted for several hours.\n\"Welcome to the hut of a poor sinner!\" The words were accompanied by good-hearted laughter.\n\"It looks like a rich sinner,\" I retorted.\n\"The saints come very seldom to this place,\" he said, \"they don't want to be contaminated with sin.\"\n\"But they are not afraid to receive your wives and children. I just met them in church.\"\n\"I know. I give everyone a coin for the collection plate. I guess I finance half of the church's budget. They are glad to take my money, but they don't want me.\"\nI sat in thoughtful silence.\nAfter a while he continued, \" I feel sorry for the pastor. By refusing to accept the polygamous men in town as church members, he has made his flock poor. They shall always be dependent upon subsidies from America. He has created a church of women whom he tells every Sunday that polygamy is wrong.\"\n\"Wasn't your first wife heart-broken when you took a second one?\"\nOmodo looked at me almost with pity. \"It was her happiest day,\" he said finally.\n\"Tell me how it happened.\"\n\"Well, one day after she had come home from the garden and had fetched wood and water, she was preparing the evening meal, while I sat in front of my house and watched her. Suddenly she turned to me and mocked me. She called me a `poor man,' because I had only one wife. She pointed to our neighbor's wife who could care for her children while the other wife prepared the food.\"\n\"Poor man,\" Omodo repeated. \"I can take much, but not that. I had to admit that she was right. She needed help. She had already picked out a second wife for me and they get along fine.\"\nI glanced around the courtyard and saw a beautiful young woman, about 19 or 20, come out of one of the huts.\n\"It was a sacrifice for me,\" Omodo commented. \"Her father demanded a very high bride price.\"\n\"Do you mean that the wife, who caused you to become a polygamist is the only one of your family who receives communion?\"\n\"Yes, she told the missionary how hard it was for her to share her love for me with another woman. According to the church, my wives are considered sinless because each of them has only one husband. I, the father, am the only sinner in our family. Since the Lord's supper is not given to sinners, I am excluded from it. Do you understand that, pastor?\"\nI was entirely confused.\n\"And you see,\" Omodo continued, \"they are all praying for me that I might be saved from sin, but they don't agree from which sin I must be saved.\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"Well, the pastor prays that I may not continue to commit the sin of polygamy. My wives pray that I may not commit the sin of divorce. I wonder whose prayers are heard first.\"\n\"So your wives are afraid that you become a Christian?\"\n\"They are afraid that I become a church member. Let's put it that way. For me there is a difference. You see, they can only have intimate relations with me as long as I do not belong to the church. In the moment I would become a church member, their marriage relations with me would become sinful.\"\n\"Wouldn't you like to become a church member?\"\n\"Pastor, don't lead me into temptation ! How can I become a church member if it means disobeying Christ? Christ forbade divorce, but not polygamy. The church forbids polygamy but demands divorce. How can I become a church member if I want to be a Christian? For me there is only one way: be a Christian without the church.\"\n\"Have you ever talked to your pastor about that?\"\n\"He does not dare to talk to me, because he knows as well as I do that some of his elders have a second wife secretly. The only difference between them and me is that I am honest and they are hypocrites.\"\n\"Did a missionary ever talk to you?\"\n\"Yes, once. I told him that with the high divorce rate in Europe, they have only a successive form of polygamy while we have a simultaneous polygamy. That did it. He never came back.\"\nI was speechless. Omodo accompanied me back to the village. He evidently enjoyed being seen with a pastor.\n\"But tell me, why did you take a third wife?\" I asked him.\n\"I did not take her. I inherited her from my later brother, including her children. Actually my older brother would have been next in line. But he is an elder. He is not allowed to sin by giving security to a widow.\"\nI looked in his eyes. \"Do you want to become a Christian?\"\n\"I am a Christian.\" Omodo said without smiling.\nWhat does it mean to take responsibility as a congregation for Omodo? I am sorry that I was not able to see Omodo again. Our conversation contains in a nutshell the main attitudes of polygamists toward the church. It is always healthy to see ourselves with the eyes of an outsider.\nI asked myself: What would I have done if I were the pastor in Omodo's town? Let me share with you my thoughts and then ask for your criticism. They are based on many experiences in dealing with other polygamist families. Maybe you have better ideas than I have. Please, help me to help Omodo.\nThe trouble with Omodo is that, unlike Joseph or Elsie, he did not ask for help. But that does not mean that he is not in need of help. The fact that he did almost all the talking and hardly gave me a chance, proves his inner insecurity. His sarcasm showed me that deep down in his heart he was afraid of me.\nIn order to take this fear away, I accepted defeat. You will have noticed that I was a defeated person when I left him. If you want to win someone over, nothing better can happen to you than defeat. In the eyes of the world the cross of Jesus Christ was a defeat. Yet, God saved the world by this defeat. In talking with people we must remember this truth. We can easily win an argument, but lose a person. Our task is not to defend, but to witness.\nHumble acceptance of defeat is often the most convincing testimony we can give for our humble Lord. It is the one thing which the other one does not expect. Counseling is not preaching at a short distance. It is ninety percent listening.\nWhen I have a conversation like this I ask myself first of all, where is the other one right? I think Omodo is right in his criticism of contradictory church policies, which sometimes deny our own doctrines. We have made the church the laughing-stock of a potentially polygamous society. We have often acted according to the statement, \"There are three things that last forever: faith, hope and love, but the greatest of them all is church order and discipline.\"\nSome churches demand that a polygamous man separate himself from all his wives, some from all but one. Others demand that he keep the first one; others allow him to choose. Some allow that his wives stay with him under the condition that he has no intercourse with them.\nSome do not even allow polygamists to enter the catechumen class. Others allow them, but do not baptize them. Again others baptize them, but do not give them communion. A few allow them full church membership, but forbid them to hold office.\nThe most generous solution was to baptize a polygamist only on his death bed. It happened to a Swedish missionary once that such a polygamist did not die but recovered after baptism. The church council decided, \"Such things must not happen.\" They did not specify whether they referred to the recovery of the polygamist or to his baptism. We have made ourselves fools before the world with our policies. Let us admit honestly our helplessness first of all. We are facing a problem where we just do not know what to do.\nMaybe our mistake is that we want to establish a general law for all cases. We want to be like God, knowing what is good and evil and have decided that monogamy is \"good\" and polygamy \"evil\" while the Word of God clearly does not say so. The Old Testament has no outspoken commandment against polygamy and the New Testament is conspicuously silent about it. Instead of dealing with polygamy, the Bible has a message for polygamists.\nTherefore let us not deal with an abstract problem. Instead let us meet a concrete person. Let us meet Omodo. Is he a special case? Well, every one of us is a \"special case\" in one way or another. There are no two persons exactly alike. Still, if we can help in one case like that of Omodo's, we might find the key to deal with many others. So, what would I have done?\nFirst of all, I would have gone back to visit him again. Church discipline, as the New Testament understands it, starts with me, not with the other one. If possible, I would have taken my wife along. I would have asked her to tell Omodo what she would think of me if I let her work all day in the garden, get wood and water, care for the children and prepare the food while I sit idly in the shade all day under the eaves of my hut and watch her work. I think she would have told him that he does not have three wives, but actually he has no wife at all. He is married to three female slaves. Consequently, he is not a real husband; he's just a married male. Only a real husband makes a wife a real wife.\nIn the meantime I would have talked to Omodo's first wife and told her precisely the same, that only a real wife makes a husband a real husband. I would have challenged her because she had not demanded enough from her husband. She had behaved like an overburdened slave trying to solve her problem by getting a second slave. Instead, she should have asked her husband to help her. She should have behaved like a partner and expected partnership.\nShe probably would have thought I was joking and not have understood at all. So I would have explained and we would have talked, visit after visit, week after week. Then finally I would have asked her why she ridiculed her husband. I am sure there was something deeper behind it, a concrete humiliation for which she took revenge, a hidden hatred.\nAt the same time, I would have continued to talk to Omodo -- not telling him anything which I had learned from his wife, but listening to his side of the story. I am sure I would have heard precisely the opposite of what his wife had said. I would have tried to make him understand his wife and to make his wife understand her husband. Then, maybe after months, I would have started to see them both together at the same time, possibly again accompanied by my wife.\nThe best way to teach marriage of partnership is by example. One day we were discussing this in our \"marriage class,\" a one-year course I taught at Cameroon Christian College. The students were telling me that African women are just not yet mature enough to be treated as equal partners. While we were discussing this, rain was pouring down. We watched through the window of the classroom the wife of the headmaster of our primary schools, who jumped from her bicycle and sought refuge under the roof of the school building. After a little while a car drove up. Out stepped her husband. He handed her the car keys, and off she drove with the car, while he followed her on the bicycle getting soaked in the rain. This settled the argument. It is up to the husband to make his wife a partner.\nThen, one day I would have attacked the case of the second wife. I can imagine her story. She probably was given into marriage with Omodo for a high bride price at a very young age. I would have tried to find out how she felt about her situation. Young and attractive as she was, I cannot imagine that she was so terribly excited by old fat Omodo. It is very likely that she had a young lover alongside. I have found that women in polygamous marriages often live in adultery, because their husbands, staying usually with one wife for a week at a time, are not able to satisfy them.\nSolving the problem of the second wife would involve talks with her father and \"fathers\" and also with the young man she really loves. It would have been a hard battle, but I do not think a hopeless one. It is a question of faith. I would trust Jesus that He can do a miracle. I would ask some Christians in the congregation who understand the power of prayer to pray when I talk to the father. Every father wants to have a happy daughter. I would try to convince him to pay the bride price back to Omodo (or at least a part of it).\nThe first time I would have suggested to Omodo to let his second wife go, he probably would have thrown me out the front door. So I would have entered again through the back door. I would have tried to tire him out by an unceasing barrage of love.\nIt is very important that by now a very deep personal contact and friendship is established between Omodo and me, a \"partnership in swimming.\" In this partnership Jesus Christ becomes a reality between us even when His name is not mentioned in every conversation.\nOne day, I think, Omodo would have admitted that he did not take his second wife just out of unselfish love for his first one, but that he considered his first wife as dark bread when he had appetite for a piece of candy.\nNow, we could start to talk meaningfully about sin. Not about the sinfulness of polygamy, but about concrete sins in his polygamous state.\nTo talk to a polygamist about the sinfulness of polygamy is of as little help as talking to a soldier about the sinfulness of war or to a slave about the sinfulness of slavery. Paul sent the slave Onesimus back to his slave master, while at the same time he proclaimed a message incompatible with slavery which finally caused its downfall. Paul broke the institution of slavery from inside, not from outside. This is a law in God's kingdom which can be called the \"law of gradual infiltration.\" It took centuries until slavery was outlawed. God is very patient. Why are we so impatient?\nSo I would have talked to Omodo about his selfishness. I would have talked to his first wife about her hatred, lies and hypocrisy and to the second one about her adultery. In the minute they began to see how these things separate them from God, it would not have been difficult to make them aware of their need of forgiveness. Then we could have talked about reconciliation with God. This reconciliation would have happened through the absolution. \"He has enlisted us in this service of reconciliation.\" (2 Corinthians 5:18)\nAfter the experience of the absolution, we would have tried together to find the will of God for each person involved. Would the separation of Omodo from his second wife be a divorce? It depends upon whether we consider polygamy also as a form of marriage.\nParenthetically, I believe we may have to. Let us be fair. Polygamy is not \"permanent adultery\" as a missionary once tried to tell me. Adultery is never permanent. It is a momentary relationship in secrecy with no responsibility involved. Polygamy, on the other hand, is a public state, often based on a legally valid contract. It involves life-long responsibility and obligations. If polygamy is marriage, separation is divorce.\nIf we compare marriage with a living organism, husband and wife can be compared with the two essential organs, the head and the heart. In all higher-developed organisms one head corresponds to one heart. Only primitive organisms are just a plurality of cells, as for example the Alga volvox globator. Parts of that organism are relatively independent from the whole. A tapeworm can be cut apart and the parts are still able to live. One could compare polygamy with a primitive organism, which has not yet reached the state in which one head corresponds to one heart. Still, a tapeworm is one organism as much as polygamy is marriage.\nOur dilemma is that we want monogamy and we do not want divorce. Yet, in a polygamous situation we cannot have one without the other. There are situations in life where we have the choice between two sins and where the next step can only be taken in counting on the forgiveness of our crucified Savior. It is in such situations where Luther gave the advice in all evangelical freedom, \"Sin bravely!\" being guided by the love for your neighbor and by what is most helpful to that neighbor. For me, there is no doubt that in Omodo's case the most helpful solution for his second wife would be to marry the man she loves.\nThe case of Omodo's third wife, whom he had inherited from his late brother, is probably the most difficult one. In 0modo's case it was especially difficult, because she was blind. I would have gathered the elders of the church and explored possibilities with them on how to support her through congregational help in case she wanted to live independently. The way a congregation treats their widows is the best test of their willingness and ability to carry responsibility for the individual.\nOne question is still open: When would I have baptized Omodo? I do not know. One cannot answer this question theoretically. I hope you understand that what I have just described is not the work of an afternoon, but of months, maybe years. Under the condition that this work is done, the moment chosen for baptism is not of decisive importance. There are no chronological laws in the process of salvation.\nI would not have baptized Omodo before he had an experience of private confession and absolution. But then, someplace along the way, I would have done it, asking God for guidance together with the congregation for the right moment.\nWe should get away from considering church discipline as a matter of sin and righteousness, but rather put it on the basis of faith and unbelief. Faith is not a nothing and the use of the sacraments is not a nothing. In case it would have taken years to find a solution for Omodo's wives, I would have expected such a solution as fruit of his baptism and not as a condition for it.\nIn the meantime, while working and praying for a solution, Omodo would have to \"sin bravely,\" sensing his polygamous state more and more as a burden. As his brother in Christ, together with the congregation, I could only act then according to Galatians 6:2 which says: \"Bear one another's burden and fulfill the law of Christ.\"\nIf we followed that course of action, would then the walls break and the church be flooded by polygamy? I do not believe so. For economic reasons, polygamy is on the retreat anyway in Africa. The current generation of Africans longs for a monogamous marriage of partnership. We overestimate ourselves if we always think we have to keep shoring up the walls so they won't break. The statement \"God is a God of order\" is not in the Bible. First Corinthians 14:33 reads, \" God is not a God of disorder, but of peace.\"\nCounseling the individual is putting congregational responsibility into practice. In the process of counseling, the unacceptable person is taken aside, away from the crowd, and unconditionally accepted. To help the individual in the name of the God of peace, we need both the rules and the exceptions. The counselor has to give himself into life with its many different situations and happenings and \"swim\" with his counselee. God is with them in the water.\nHoward Culbertson, Southern Nazarene University, 6729 NW 39th, Bethany, OK 73008 | Phone: 405-491-6693 - Fax: 405-491-6658\nCopyright \u00a9 2002 - Last Updated: October 10, 2011 | URL: http:\/\/home.snu.edu\/~hculbert\/trobisch.htm\nYou have permission to reprint what you just read.

In 2006, about 18% of global final energy consumption came from renewables, with 13% coming from traditional biomass, such as wood-burning. Hydroelectricity was the next largest renewable source, providing 3% of global energy consumption and 15% of global electricity generation.\nWind power is growing at the rate of 30 percent annually, with a worldwide installed capacity of 121,000 megawatts (MW) in 2008, and is widely used in European countries and the United States. The annual manufacturing output of the photovoltaics industry reached 6,900 MW in 2008, and photovoltaic (PV) power stations are popular in Germany and Spain. Solar thermal power stations operate in the USA and Spain, and the largest of these is the 354 MW SEGS power plant in the Mojave Desert. The world's largest geothermal power installation is The Geysers in California, with a rated capacity of 750 MW. Brazil has one of the largest renewable energy programs in the world, involving production of ethanol fuel from sugar cane, and ethanol now provides 18 percent of the country's automotive fuel. Ethanol fuel is also widely available in the USA. While most renewable energy projects and production is large-scale, renewable technologies are also suited to small off-grid applications, sometimes in rural and remote areas, where energy is often crucial in human development. Kenya has the world's highest household solar ownership rate with roughly 30,000 small (20\u2013100 watt) solar power systems sold per year.\nSome renewable energy technologies are criticised for being intermittent or unsightly, yet the renewable energy market continues to grow. Climate change concerns coupled with high oil prices, peak oil and increasing government support are driving increasing renewable energy legislation, incentives and commercialization. New government spending, regulation, and policies should help the industry weather the 2009 economic crisis better than many other sectors.\nThis text uses material from Wikipedia and is available under the GNU Free Documentation License.","id":"<urn:uuid:1408e655-896d-4edf-80ab-9e169370da2f>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/medicalxpress.com\/tags\/renewable+energy\/sort\/date\/all\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9359489679,"token_count":452,"score":2.6875,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Turning Of The Tide At Tonle Sap\nTonle Sap is an interesting body of fresh water. Certain times of the year, it is a lake and other times of the year it is a river. During the dry season (November-May) the water drains into the Mekong in Phnom Penh creating a river and when the monsoon season hits (June-October), the flow of water reverses back and forms a lake. The lake\/river hybrid is also an important element of Cambodia because of the area\u2019s rich diversity of ecological life and the water\u2019s importance to the villagers in the area.\nBon Om Thong or the Khmer Water Festival is celebrated during late October or early November\u2019s full moon when the water reverses its flow. For three days, the towns and villages along the river, including Phnom Penh bursts into life with fleets of luminously decorated boats filling Tonle Sap. Celebrations also happen in Angkor Wat, although smaller in scale it is still impressive, with the temple serving as a scenic backdrop. The highlights of the festival are the boat races that draw huge crowds from all over and are contested by hundreds of boats comprising thousands of paddlers.The festival itself has ancient roots. Angkorian kings would hold competitions and see who the greatest warriors were. You can compare this competition to a joust in Europe as a means of training and a contest under the king\u2019s watchful eye.\nBon Om Thong also has spiritual significance.

{"text":"By Chris Wickham\nLONDON (Reuters) - Scientists in Switzerland have come up with a material mimicking the way tendons connect to bones, which could speed the development of stretchy, wearable electronic devices.\nThe stretchable electronics industry is in its infancy but devices that are able to flex without breaking could revolutionize devices from smartphones and solar cells to medical implants.\nFuturists have long predicted clothes with sensors that monitor the vital signs of the wearer, or smartphones and screens woven into the fabric of shirts or jackets.\nBut while circuits and wiring are quite happy on rigid surfaces like those in a tablet computer, they break easily when combined with materials that stretch.\n\"You have two materials with very different mechanical properties,\" Andre Studart, a researcher at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, told Reuters. \"The challenge is to bridge these different properties.\"\nStudart and his team have overcome the problem with a stretchy material made from polyurethane that contains \"islands\" stiff enough to house and protect delicate circuits.\nWhile the soft part can stretch by 350 percent, the stiff regions created by impregnating the material with tiny platelets of aluminum oxide and a synthetic clay called laponite, hardly deform and can protect the electronics.\nThe material, presented in research published in the journal Nature Communications, is made from bonded layers and because the concentration of the platelets is gradually increased, the junction between the stretchy and stiff parts is also durable.\n\"There are many biological materials that have these properties as well, like the way tendons link muscle to bone,\" said Studart. \"But there are not so many examples in synthetic materials.\"\nOne of the companies trying to commercialize stretchable electronics is MC10 Inc, a Massachusetts-based start-up born out of research by John Rogers and his team at the University of Illinois.\nThe firm recently announced plans to start selling a sensor-laden, flexible skullcap that monitors impacts to the head during sports. It was developed with Reebok and goes on sale next year.\nAmar Kendale, the company's strategist, said the skullcap gives a level of contact with the head that previous attempts to put sensors in helmets or gum shields have not been able to achieve.\nMC10 is using a different approach from the Zurich team. The company uses extremely thin silicon chips sandwiched in a stretchable polymer and connected by tiny wires in a concertina configuration that can stretch about 60 percent, about the same as the body's soft tissues.\nMC10 has also developed a balloon catheter with built-in electronic sensors for heart patients, which researchers plan to start testing on people in the next year or so.\n\"Decorating the surface of the balloon with sensors or a mechanism that delivers energy gives a good way of delivering therapy to soft tissue, like the heart, to correct arrhythmia,\" Kendale said.\nMarket potential is difficult to estimate but Kendale said the technology could be applied to the monitoring and management of chronic diseases from diabetes to hypertension.\nThe Swiss researchers say their technique could also be used to build synthetic cartilage or false teeth with better matches to their natural counterparts.\nCurrently the ceramics used for dental fillings are so hard they can damage natural teeth if a patient bites too hard. And one treatment for women with crumbling vertebrae from osteoporosis involves injecting a stiff polymer that over time can damage the surrounding healthy vertebrae.\n\"The problem is that it is equally stiff everywhere,\" said Studart. \"The vision is that you will be able to make materials that are as heterogeneous as the biological ones.\"\n(Editing by David Holmes)","id":"<urn:uuid:82a3456c-29b8-4dcb-9306-ea76ba63d58b>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/ktwb.com\/news\/articles\/2012\/dec\/11\/new-material-for-stretchy-electronics-inspired-by-nature\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9543480277,"token_count":757,"score":2.609375,"int_score":3}

{"text":"The NIDCD award will provide $300,000 over the next three years to fund the project, titled \u201cAuditory masking effects on speech fluency in aphasia and apraxia of speech.\u201d\nIn many adults who survive stroke, damage to speech regions of the brain results in a distorted, effortful, and halting pattern of speech, a condition called apraxia of speech. Although they know what they want to say and have intact muscle strength, they have difficulty programming the movements for speech. They are able to hear their speech errors, and the typical treatment program focuses on identifying these errors and correcting them. For most people, focusing on these mistakes results in little improvement in their speech.\nIn contrast to conventional treatment approaches, Dr. Jacks and his colleagues (Katarina Haley, PhD, DAHS, DSHS; Heidi Roth, MD, Department of Neurology) are studying the effects of preventing the person with apraxia of speech from hearing the errors in their speech, by playing loud noise through earphones. This approach is based on the premise that people with this speech disorder are overly-attuned to speech errors, which prevents them from speaking fluently. The same phenomenon has been known for decades to help people who stutter to speak fluently, as demonstrated in the popular film The King's Speech.\nIn the proposed research, Dr. Jacks and his colleagues seek to identify stroke survivors who respond positively to listening to noise by increasing speech rate and decreasing the occurrence of speech disfluencies (pauses, filler words, repetitions). Since not all people are expected to show a change in speech while listening to noise, the team also will study individual characteristics to determine what differentiates those who improve from those who do not. In particular, behavioral profiles (type of speech and language impairment) and location and size of brain lesion will be compared between positive responders and non-responders to determine whether a positive response can be predicted from routine clinical data.\nIn preliminary work, over half of the participants tested spoke more quickly and with fewer disfluencies while listening to noise. Although this is a temporary effect and does not persist after the noise is turned off, the moments of speech fluency experienced may cause the person's brain to activate in a different way than it does when he or she is speaking disfluently. If the preliminary results are borne out in the completed study, Dr. Jacks and his team believe that the procedure may be further developed into a useful therapeutic technique that can result in lasting speech changes.","id":"<urn:uuid:80066780-30ef-41d7-ba75-2736792d2bd1>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.med.unc.edu\/ahs\/sphs\/news\/jacks-receives-nidcd-award-to-study-speech-impairment-treatment","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9640641809,"token_count":521,"score":3.015625,"int_score":3}
{"text":"First ever direct measurement of the Earth\u2019s rotation\nGeodesists are pinpointing the orientation of the Earth\u2019s axis using the world\u2019s most stable ring laser\nA group with researchers at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and the Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy (BKG) are the first to plot changes in the Earth\u2019s axis through laboratory measurements. To do this, they constructed the world\u2019s most stable ring laser in an underground lab and used it to determine changes in the Earth\u2019s rotation. Previously, scientists were only able to track shifts in the polar axis indirectly by monitoring fixed objects in space. Capturing the tilt of the Earth\u2019s axis and its rotational velocity is crucial for precise positional information on Earth \u2013 and thus for the accurate functioning of modern navigation systems, for instance. The scientists\u2019 work has been recognized an Exceptional Research Spotlight by the American Physical Society.\nThe Earth wobbles. Like a spinning top touched in mid-spin, its rotational axis fluctuates in relation to space. This is partly caused by gravitation from the sun and the moon. At the same time, the Earth\u2019s rotational axis constantly changes relative to the Earth\u2019s surface. On the one hand, this is caused by variation in atmospheric pressure, ocean loading and wind. These elements combine in an effect known as the Chandler wobble to create polar motion. Named after the scientist who discovered it, this phenomenon has a period of around 435 days. On the other hand, an event known as the \u201cannual wobble\u201d causes the rotational axis to move over a period of a year. This is due to the Earth\u2019s elliptical orbit around the sun. These two effects cause the Earth\u2019s axis to migrate irregularly along a circular path with a radius of up to six meters.\nCapturing these movements is crucial to create a reliable coordinate system that can feed navigation systems or project trajectory paths in space travel. \u201cLocating a point to the exact centimeter for global positioning is an extremely dynamic process \u2013 after all, at our latitude, we are moving at around 350 meters to the east per second,\u201d explains Prof. Karl Ulrich Schreiber, meanwhile as station director of the geodetic observatory Wettzell where the ring laser is settled. Karl Ulrich Schreiber had directed the project in TUM\u2019s Research Section Satellite Geodesy. The geodetic observatory Wettzell is run together by TUM and BKG.\nThe researchers have succeeded in corroborating the Chandler and annual wobble measurements based on the data captured by radio telescopes. They now aim to make the apparatus more accurate, enabling them to determine changes in the Earth\u2019s rotational axis over a single day. The scientists also plan to make the ring laser capable of continuous operation so that it can run for a period of years without any deviations. \u201cIn simple terms,\u201d concludes Schreiber, \u201cin future, we want to be able to just pop down into the basement and find out how fast the Earth is accurately turning right now.\"\nFor more information please visit the TU M\u00fcnchen homepage http:\/\/portal.mytum.de\/pressestelle\/pressemitteilungen\/NewsArticle_20111220_100621\/newsarticle_view?.","id":"<urn:uuid:d4281798-7278-4727-a736-be4cecc072f8>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.bkg.bund.de\/nn_149566\/sid_0F335650A0F77C3C47FE83A10BEB41EC\/nsc_true\/EN\/News\/01News\/N2011\/2011__12__27ring-laser.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.909265101,"token_count":710,"score":3.921875,"int_score":4}
{"text":"DUBAI, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) -- With new oil and gas nations coming up and renewable energy usage gaining global momentum, the fossil fuels-rich Gulf states might run into rough waters in the upcoming decades.\nThe Gulf states like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are today synonyms for oil, but that could change soon.\nAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the Gulf monopoly of oil supply is contested by the United States which is on the way to become the largest oil exporter throughout the world by 2030.\nMeantime, Lebanon and Israel, two old arch-foes in the Middle East technically still at war, started digging deeply off the Mediterranean coast in search for oil and gas.\nIn addition, the global rise of solar power, wind energy and bio-thermal heat rivals the fossil fuels' monopoly as the only safe and reliable source of energy.\nAt the 6th World Future Energy Summit (WFES) that was held on Jan. 15-17 in Abu Dhabi, the participants were able to see how the world would function without the use of oil and gas or at least with less fossil fuels.\nThe Catecar, a Switzerland-based company, presented the Dragonfly, a solar-powered hybrid which does not need to be plugged because the solar panel is fixed on the roof.\nMeanwhile, Abu Dhabi's environmental city Masdar launched a pilot project aiming at running sea-water desalination plants with solar or wind power by 2020 \"in order to reduce the very expensive use of oil and gas to run such plants,\" said Dr. Sultan Al-Jaber, the chief executive of Masdar.\nAt present, half of the world's desalinated water is produced in the Gulf Arab region.\nDuring the summit, the Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council presented how we live next in the Estidama-house, a building equipped only with environmentally-friendly installations that secure an efficient use of water and electricity.\nWashington's independence on Arab oil till 2030 would have deep implications for U.S. military bases in the region, where two thirds of the world's known oil reserves are located, the German daily Die Welt reported in a secret study which the German intelligence service BND released.\nThe report estimated that most of Middle Eastern oil would flow to East Asia.\nMoreover, the United States is sitting on large shale gas reserves as a source of natural gas. Due to shale gas discoveries, the world's largest economy might also become autonomous in producing its own natural gas.\nHowever, the method to access shale gas through \"fracking\" is strongly slammed by environmentalists who see huge danger for nature if shale gas is extracted from mountainous regions.\nMeanwhile, Lebanon, known so far as the only Arab country without a desert and without oil, held the country's first International Oil and Gas Summit in Beirut.\nThe summit was held after an exploration company from Norway found huge gas reserves beneath the Eastern Mediterranean Sea offshore of Lebanon, which would have the potential of becoming a second Kuwait once it starts exporting gas.\nLebanon's southern neighbor Israel claims parts of that field known as Leviathan, comprising 17 trillion cubic foot of natural gas.\nA Dubai-based economist, who requested anonymity, said that the disputed gas field might lay the foundation for the next Middle East war.\nMorten Mauritzen, the president for the Gulf region at U.S. energy giant ExxonMobil, said at the energy summit in Abu Dhabi, which harbors some 7 percent of the world's known oil reserves, that the demand for oil and gas would rise 35 percent until 2040, dampening hopes that renewable energy like wind power, solar energy or thermal earth-heat would play a significant role in the future.\n\"Oil and gas are reliable, safe and accessible for all, while solar energy is not scalable to satisfy the huge demand,\" said Mauritzen.\nAccording to ExxonMobil's forecast, world population will grow to 8.7 billion in the next 30 years, up from the current 7 billion.\nExxonMoil currently upgrades together with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company drilling technologies in the Upper Zakum, the world's largest offshore oilfield.\n\"We are reclaiming land to build four artificial islands in the Upper Zakum in order to build stations for machines and staff,\" said Mauritzen.\nHe noted that this was a unique example how oil exploration can be done in a cost-efficient way.","id":"<urn:uuid:f95463bb-cac0-4d2f-9ef3-f4608252a4f2>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/news.xinhuanet.com\/english\/world\/2013-01\/21\/c_132115427.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9496784806,"token_count":912,"score":2.65625,"int_score":3}

{"text":"President Obama\u2019s announcement Friday that his administration will stop deporting eligible undocumented people under the age of 30 is certain to provide fodder for more election-season debates over immigration. Politics aside, however, the new policy will certainly make waves in early learning centers, schools and social services agencies, where children and young parents affected by the new policy are likely to interact with schools and government programs in new ways.\nUnder the new policy, undocumented residents under 30 will be allowed to reside in the United States if they meet a set of criteria, such as having arrived in the United States before the age of 16 or having either a high school diploma, GED or serving in the military. The policy does not provide a path to citizenship, like many Democrat versions of the DREAM Act have in the past.\nBelow, three of our biggest questions on what\u2019s to come:\n1) Will parents with children in states with strict immigration laws actually feel more protected? Will those states bend to meet the spirit of the federal policy?\nThe administration is emphasizing that it wants to focus resources on deporting people that pose a \u201cnational security or public safety risk,\u201d and less on deporting as many illegal immigrants as possible, regardless of their contributions to society.\nBut the new policy, which the Associated Press estimates will affect up to 800,000 young people, doesn\u2019t necessarily change the mood in states such as Alabama, where a law passed last year (and currently being challenged by the Obama administration in the 11th circuit U.S. Court of Appeals) requires children to document their immigration status when they enroll in school. Many believe that the law is intimidating families with more than one undocumented member, and even preventing them from sending their children to school \u2014 despite the fact that undocumented children have the right to a public education in the U.S.\n2) Will the new policy have any effect on families\u2019 enrollment in home visiting programs or on children\u2019s enrollment in child care and pre-K programs? Parents who reside in the United States illegally have been known anecdotally to shy away from enrolling in home visiting programs and\/or state-funded pre-K for fear that government officials could find out the immigration status of the family. It\u2019s possible, then, that young immigrant parents in good standing with the government will be more inclined to enroll in such programs in the future.\n3) How many parents with young children, illegal or legal, will be affected? Many parents under 30 are now eligible to stay in the United States, but there is a limit to how helpful this will be: For example, under the new policy, an undocumented 8-year old with parents over 30 still risks losing his or her parents due to deportation.\nEnsuring that immigrant children grow up without their parents being deported isn\u2019t the explicit goal of the new policy. It\u2019s something to keep in mind, however, as these policies evolve and change in the future.

{"text":"By Sue Weishar, Ph.D.\nOn August 25, 2008, the small town of Laurel, Mississippi was the site of the largest single workplace site raid in U.S. history. Early that morning hundreds of Immigration Control and Enforcement (ICE) agents swooped down on the Howard Industries plant in Laurel, which produces electric transformers, and began rounding up workers. Anyone who appeared to be of Hispanic origin was separated from other workers and escorted outside to a fenced yard. Roads around the sprawling plant were blocked and ICE helicopters hovered overhead. One resident thought there had been a terrorist attack.1 For the 595 immigrant workers that were arrested that day, there might as well have been. By evening of that long, hot summer day, 488 immigrant workers, many in handcuffs, had been transported on dozens of ICE buses to an immigrant detention center in Jena, Louisiana, four hours away\u2014ripped apart from their families and a community they had come to think of as home. Another 107 persons, mostly women, had been deemed \u201chumanitarian\u201d cases2 and were released with electronic monitoring devices attached to their ankles. They were forced to wear these devices day and night for 22 months.\nIn the midst of such terror, a small Catholic church became the center of solace and assistance. Several Catholic agencies and the Loyola University New Orleans Law Clinic also played key roles in assisting raid victims. This article examines the Church\u2019s response to the raid in Laurel,3 and how a small Catholic community in the middle of a deeply conservative state was able to mitigate some of the harmful effects of the raid on its immigrant members.","id":"<urn:uuid:f7b6b1f4-2d5c-4b49-92f4-f33b17e078a5>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.loyno.edu\/jsri\/news\/welcoming-church-mississippi-congregation-reaches-out-after-devastating-immigration-raid","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9845540524,"token_count":337,"score":2.5625,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Sri Lanka: Year In Review 2011Article Free Pass\nIn 2011 Sri Lanka continued to recover from its 26-year civil war, which had ended in 2009. Pres. Mahinda Rajapakse enjoyed great popularity among the majority Sinhalese community for having defeated the Tamil Tigers (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam; LTTE). As expected, the United People\u2019s Freedom Alliance, led by Rajapakse, dominated local government elections held in March and July. Predominantly Tamil areas formerly held by the LTTE in the north and east of the country voted for the Tamil National Alliance.\nDuring 2011 the president moved to consolidate political power (much of it held by members of his family) in the executive branch of government while placing limits on media freedom, the role of civil society in Sri Lankan politics, and the expression of antigovernment dissent. In August it was announced that emergency regulations in place for nearly three decades were being lifted, but this still left many powers in government hands and failed to allay fears of repression among some Sri Lankans.\nInternational attention was directed throughout the year toward alleged violations of human rights in Sri Lanka. A highly critical report submitted to the UN Human Rights Council in September charged that both the LTTE and government forces deliberately targeted civilians during the civil war. The government refused to permit an international investigation into human rights violations in Sri Lanka, and in October it announced the creation of a National Action Plan designed to protect and promote human rights and support reconciliation between the communities.\nFormer general Sarath Fonseka, who had commanded the Sri Lankan army in its victory over the Tamil Tigers and later had become a political rival of Rajapakse, was sentenced to three years in prison for allegedly stating that the Sri Lankan government had committed war crimes during the civil war. Fonseka was already serving a 30-month jail term after having been convicted of corruption in military procurements. He denied both charges, claiming that they were politically motivated to keep him out of politics.\nEconomic growth in Sri Lanka, which had continued throughout the war period, slowed in 2009 because of the global recession but then accelerated rapidly. GDP was expected to rise by at least 8% in 2011, despite floods in January that displaced more than a million people and damaged rice and other crops. Major economic issues included continued poverty, employment creation and skill provision, the reconstruction of war-damaged areas, a large deficit in the government budget, and persistent inflation. Nevertheless, an IMF mission to Sri Lanka in August\u2013September pronounced macroeconomic conditions there satisfactory and stated that monetary and fiscal policies were appropriate. Yet many believed that to sustain high growth rates in the future, significant policy reforms would be required. Foreign aid and remittances from Sri Lankan workers employed abroad were important sources of foreign exchange. Foreign direct investment was rising, but a conference held in September suggested that fears regarding political risk were holding back that investment.\nWhat made you want to look up \"Sri Lanka: Year In Review 2011\"?

{"text":"Gene fault linked to stroke risk\nA \u201csingle genetic mutation can double your risk of stroke\u201d, the Daily Mail has reported. The newspaper added that scientists hope the discovery could lead to tailored treatments for the condition.\nThe news is based on research which looked for genetic variations that were more common in people who had had an ischaemic stroke than in people who had not had one. Ischaemic strokes occur when the blood flow to a part of the brain is blocked. They account for 80% of stroke cases. By testing the DNA of several thousand participants, the researchers identified a new genetic variant that was associated with increased risk of a type of ischaemic stroke called a \u201clarge vessel stroke\u201d. In large vessel strokes, one or more of the arteries supplying blood to the brain become blocked. People can carry up to two copies of the variant, and the study\u2019s authors estimated that each copy of the variant a person carried was associated with about a 42% increase in the odds of a large vessel stroke. However, it is not yet known whether this genetic variant raises the risk of a stroke, or if it is found near to another variant that is responsible for the increased risk.\nThis well-designed study has identified a new association between a genetic variation and strokes. However, the study cannot confirm whether the variation itself causes the increased risk of a stroke. This key issue will need to be clarified before these findings can contribute to the development of the new treatments that many newspapers optimistically predicted.\nWhere did the story come from?\nThe study was carried out by researchers from the University of Oxford, St George\u2019s, University of London, and a number of other UK and international universities and research institutes. It was funded by The Wellcome Trust. The study was published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Nature Genetics.\nThis study was covered by a number of newspapers. In general, the coverage of the research was good, although many news stories focused on its potential to lead to the development of screening tests and new treatments. However, there is no guarantee that this research will lead to such advances. If it does, they are likely to be some way off.\nWhat kind of research was this?\nThis case-control study aimed to identify genetic factors that are associated with an increased risk of ischaemic strokes. Ischaemic strokes occur when there is a blockage of blood flow to part of the brain. This can deprive brain cells of vital oxygen and nutrients. Around 80% of strokes are ischaemic. The remainder are haemorrhagic strokes, caused by a blood vessel rupturing in or around the brain.\nTo find genetic variants associated with strokes, the researchers read the DNA sequences of a group of patients who had had an ischaemic stroke. They compared them to the sequences of a group of healthy people. Their theory was that genetic variations that were more common among the stroke group could potentially be linked to stroke risk. To verify whether the variants they initially identified in these groups were associated with strokes, the researchers tested if the same pattern was seen when another group of stroke patients were compared with another group of healthy individuals (controls). This is an accepted method that is used when performing genetic studies of this type.\nAlthough this was a well-designed study, genetic studies like this one can only show that a particular genetic variant is associated with a disease. Further experiments are required to see if the variants identified have a role in causing strokes, or if they lie close to other genetic variants that have this effect. What these variants do still needs to be identified, so media claims that this research could lead to potential new treatments seem premature.\nIt is also important to remember that genetic, medical and lifestyle factors are likely to contribute to a person\u2019s risk of a stroke. It should not be assumed that a person\u2019s genetics mean that they will definitely have a stroke. Equally, people without high-risk genetics may still be at risk of a stroke risk because of lifestyle factors, such as smoking.\nWhat did the research involve?\nIn the first phase of the study, researchers recruited 3,548 individuals who had had an ischaemic stroke (the cases) and 5,972 healthy individuals (the controls). The researchers looked for genetic variants that were more common in the stroke group. In a second phase, the researchers confirmed their findings in a new group of 5,859 cases and 6,281 controls. The new genetic variation they identified was then re-confirmed in a further 735 cases and 28,583 controls.\nWhat were the basic results?\nThe researchers identified genetic variants at three locations that have been associated with different subtypes of ischaemic stroke in previous studies (near the genes PITX2 and ZFHX3, and on the short arm of chromosome 9). In addition, they identified a genetic variant at a new position within the HDAC9 gene, which was associated with a subtype of ischaemic stroke called large vessel stroke. In large vessel strokes, one or more of the large arteries supplying blood to the brain become blocked. This variant in HDAC9 occurs on about 10% of chromosomes in people in the UK. Humans have two copies of each chromosome, and therefore we can carry up to two copies of this variant (one on each chromosome). The researchers calculated that each copy of the variant that a person possessed was associated with a 42% increase in the odds of having a large vessel stroke (odds ratio 1.42, 95% confidence interval 1.28 to 1.57 for each copy).\nHow did the researchers interpret the results?\nThe researchers concluded that they have \u201cidentified a new association with the HDAC9 gene region in large vessel stroke\u201d. They also stated that \u201cthe mechanism by which variants in the HDAC9 region increase large vessel stroke risk is not immediately clear.\u201d\nIn this study, researchers have identified a genetic variant in the HDAC9 gene that is associated with a subtype of ischaemic stroke called a large vessel stroke. Large vessel strokes occur when one or more of the arteries supplying blood to the brain become blocked.\nIn this type of study, the genetic variants identified as being associated with a condition are not necessarily the cause of the increase in risk. Instead, they may lie near another variant that is responsible for the effect. In order to unlock the role of the HDAC9 gene, researchers will now need to study it and the region surrounding it more closely, both to confirm whether the variation in this gene is responsible for the increase in stroke risk and, if so, how it has this effect.\nGenetic, medical and lifestyle factors are likely to contribute to stroke risk. In addition, multiple genetic factors may potentially contribute to the risk. It\u2019s important to note that although having higher-risk genetic variants increases the risk of having a stroke, it does not guarantee that a person will have one. Equally, people who do not have any associated variants can still be at risk of a stroke because of lifestyles factors such as smoking, drinking and their diet.\nThis well-designed study found an association between a new genetic variant and one type of stroke. As yet, it is not possible to say whether this finding will lead to the development of new treatments for large vessel strokes.\nSearch for a job\nSearch for a car\nSearch for a house\nWeather for Lisburn\nSaturday 18 May 2013\nTemperature: 9 C to 12 C\nWind Speed: 13 mph\nWind direction: North west\nTemperature: 8 C to 15 C\nWind Speed: 10 mph\nWind direction: South east","id":"<urn:uuid:035b9bce-651d-4cfb-9ad7-d89656c11d17>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.lisburntoday.co.uk\/news\/health\/gene_fault_linked_to_stroke_risk_1_3496967","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9677143097,"token_count":1568,"score":2.859375,"int_score":3}

Accreditation of universities in the USA therefore assures you and your parents that the school adheres to high quality standards. Which means the programs are delivered by qualified faculty and are constantly updated to follow the changes and meet the needs of the relevant industry or working world. Attending an accredited school or program is often thought to make you more competitive on the job market.\nUniversity accreditation in the USA takes place at different levels. At the highest level, governmental and other agencies govern and recognize the accrediting bodies. For instance, the US Department of Education, the Council for Higher Education Association (CHEA) and the Association of Specialized and Professional Accreditors (ASPA) grant power to associations that oversee accreditation at the regional, institutional or program level.\nRegional: The US Department of Education recognizes 6 distinct higher educational regions, each of which is overseen by a different accrediting body. This is the type of accreditation most commonly referred to and is for a university as a whole, not for individual programs. Accreditation by these regional agencies isn't automatic: this is voluntary accreditation.\nInstitutional: Depending on the kind of university or college it is (e.g., private, public, Christian, etc.) it may also be accredited by institute-type specific agencies. America's universities are extremely different in character, size, location and in the programs they offer. Therefore a school may be accredited by one or more organizations.\nSpecialized: Specialized accreditation focuses on specific areas of study and individual university programs. This is sometimes called professional accreditation, because it means specific programs meet the national standards for that field of study. Universities in the USA cover a huge range of programs, and each institution usually has a page on its website listing both institutional and individual program accreditation.\nWhen assessing quality, international students can also look at whether a school or program has any memberships in, or endorsements by, professional associations which reflect certain standards of quality, but this is not the same as official accreditation. For instance, the American Association of State Colleges and Universities does not accredit programs, but is a national organization committed to maintaining and promoting the quality of America's higher education system.\nRegional Accrediting Agencies for Universities in the USA\nMiddle States Association of Colleges and Schools, Commission on Higher Education\nNew England Association of Schools and Colleges, Commission on Institutions of Higher Education\nNorth Central Association of Colleges and Schools, The Higher Learning Commission\nNorthwest Commission on Colleges and Universities\nSouthern Association of Colleges and Schools, Commission on Colleges\nWestern Association of Schools and Colleges, Accrediting Commission for Senior Colleges and Universities\nWhy Accreditation? The goal of university accreditation in the USA is to ensure that education provided by institutions of higher education meets acceptable levels of quality. Accrediting agencies have no legal control over institutions or programs; they promote certain standards and approve or renew membership of institutions that apply and meet the accreditation standards or criteria. Certain licensing programs may require that you've been through a course of study with specialized accreditation, because it ensures that you have been taught by faculty qualified to teach in that field. The US Secretary of Education and CHEA each maintain and publish a list of nationally recognized accrediting agencies, and most institutions attain eligibility for Federal funds by holding accredited or pre-accredited status with one of the recognized accrediting agencies.\nTake a Virtual Tour of a featured\nCampus e-tours allow students to view the facilities and student life at featured Universities in the USA, giving you the opportunity to see what the University looks like, as well as facts about the campus, courses, etc. Once you\u2019ve completed your tour you can read the in-depth profile to get more detailed information, or click the Request FREE Info link to request specific information such as scholarships and financial aid directly from that institution.\nClick here to view Virtual Tours of Featured Universities in the USA\nRequest FREE Info!\nRequest FREE info directly from featured\nFeatured institutions want to send you more information on their\nto receive free information directly from the school.

{"text":"Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder announced on Twitter (@onetoughnerd) that he has signed Michigan's right to work laws. This makes Michigan the 24th state to protect workers from being forced to join a union. Earlier this year, Indiana became the 23rd state to do so.\n\"I have signed the freedom to work bills into law.\" - Gov Rick Snyder\u2014 Rick Snyder (@onetoughnerd) December 11, 2012\nOften misunderstood, \"right to work\" is actually a simple and very limited policy. It prevents union contracts from making payment of union dues a condition of employment. That's all. Unions can exist, but can't force people to give them money. That is, unions must convince workers that the union does something or provides something worth paying for.\nWhat anti-trust laws do to business, right-to-work laws do to unions: these laws prevent monopolies in order to protect consumers and workers.\nOne reason monopolies are disfavored was on display today on the Michigan Capitol lawn. As Lord Acton said, power corrupts, but it is absolute power that tends to corrupt absolutely. When a union is granted a monopoly, that power is eventually reinterpreted as a \"right,\" and then as an entitlement. Defense of union power becomes an ends that justifies almost any means. And so in Michigan today, supporters of right to work were brutally assaulted and their property vandalized and destroyed.","id":"<urn:uuid:dc6ec9d8-b926-4e0a-b1eb-e9ba12a0af3c>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/myfreedomfoundation.com\/blog\/detail\/michigan-becomes-the-24th-right-to-work-state","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9720175266,"token_count":292,"score":2.6875,"int_score":3}

{"text":"- Born ca. 1721\n- Revolutionary leader\n- Cousin of Thomas Jefferson\n- Attorney General of Virginia Colony\n- Chaired first and second Continental Congress\n- Died 1775\nFirst to be called \u201cFather of country\u201d\nPeyton Randolph was on the black list of patriots the British proposed to arrest and hang after he presided over the Continental Congress in 1775. Upon his return to Williamsburg, the volunteer company of militia of the city offered him its protection in an address that concluded:\n\"May heaven grant you long to live the father of your country \u2013\nand the friend to freedom and humanity!\"\nIf his friend George Washington succeeded him as America\u2019s patriarch, Randolph nevertheless did as much as any Virginian to bring the new nation into the world. He presided over every important Virginia assembly in the years leading to the Revolution, was among the first of the colony's great men to oppose the Stamp Act, chaired the first meeting of the delegates of 13 colonies at Philadelphia in 1774, and chaired the second in 1775.\nRandolph was born 54 years before the Second Continental Congress \u2013 probably in Williamsburg in 1721 \u2013 the second son of Sir John and Lady Susannah Randolph. His first name was his maternal grandmother's maiden name, just as his older brother Beverley's was their mother's. The surname Randolph identified him as a scion of 18th-century Virginia's most powerful clan.\nWhen Peyton Randolph was three or four years old, the family moved into the imposing wooden home on Market Square now known as the Peyton Randolph House. His father, among Virginia's most distinguished attorneys, Speaker of the House of Burgesses, and a wealthy man, died when Peyton was 16, leaving the house and other property for him in trust with his mother. The will also gave Peyton his father's extensive library in the hope he would \"betake himself to the study of law.\" By then, he had a brother John and a sister Mary.\nStudy of law\nAttentive to his father's wishes, Peyton Randolph attended the College of William & Mary, then learned the law in London's Inns of Court. He entered the Middle Temple on October 13, 1739, and took a place at the bar February 10, 1743. Returning to Williamsburg, he was appointed the colony's attorney general by Governor William Gooch on May 7, 1744. His father had filled the office before him, and his brother would assume the role after.\nAt the age of 24, Randolph was eligible for his inheritance. On March 8, 1746, he married Betty Harrison, and on July 21 (more than two years after his return from London), he qualified himself for the private practice of law in York County.\nHis cousin Thomas Jefferson may have shed some light on the delay in a character sketch he wrote of Randolph years later. \"He was indeed a most excellent man,\" Jefferson said, but \"heavy and inert in body, he was rather too indolent and careless for business.\"\nHe was, as well, occupied with myriad public duties. In 1747, he became a vestryman of Bruton Parish Church, and in 1748, he became Williamsburg's representative in the House of Burgesses, and in 1749, a justice of the peace.\nRandolph returned to the house in 1752 as the burgess for the college of William & Mary and on December 15, 1753, the house hired him as its special agent for some \u201cticklish business\u201d in London.\nSoon after he arrived in Virginia in 1751, Governor Robert Dinwiddie had begun to exercise a right no governor before him had tried: the imposition of a fee for certifying land patents. For his signature, Dinwiddie demanded a pistole, a Spanish coin worth about 20 shillings. Regarding the fee as an unauthorized tax, Virginians objected, though to no avail.\nPeyton Randolph was dispatched to England as the house's agent, with directions to go over the governor's head. But as attorney general, it was his duty to represent the interests of the Crown, of which Dinwiddie was the principal representative in Virginia. Randolph was attacking the right of the governor he was appointed to defend!\nThe governor refused to give Peyton Randolph permission to leave the colony, but he left anyway. In London, he had to answer for his action, and he was ousted from the attorney general's office. Dinwiddie had already named George Wythe as acting attorney general in Randolph's place.\nNevertheless, the London officials pointedly suggested that Dinwiddie reconsider his fee and said that they would have no objection to Peyton Randolph's reinstatement if he apologized. So he did, and subsequently resumed office soon after his return to Williamsburg.\nFrench and Indian War\nReelected burgess for the College of William & Mary in 1755, he involved himself the next year in a somewhat ludicrous, though harmless, attempt to promote morale during the French and Indian War. With other prominent men, he formed the Associators, a group to raise and pay bounties for private troops to join the regular force at Winchester. George Washington, in charge of the fort there, wasn't sure what he would do with the untrained men if they arrived. Not enough came, however, to cause any inconvenience.\nIn 1757, Randolph joined the college's board, and he served as a rector for one year. He was reelected burgess for Williamsburg in 1761, and thus entered the phase of his life that thrust him into a leadership role in the Revolution.\nWord of Parliament's intended Stamp Act brought Virginians and their burgesses into conflict with the Crown itself in 1764. Peyton Randolph was appointed chairman of a committee to draft protests to the king, the House of Lords, and the House of Commons maintaining the colony's exclusive right of self-taxation.\nDisagreement with Patrick Henry\nThis responsibility put Peyton Randolph at odds with Patrick Henry, the Virginian most noted for opposition to the tax. At the end of the legislative session in 1765, Henry, a freshman, introduced seven resolutions against the act. Peyton Randolph, George Wythe, and others thought that Henry's resolutions added nothing to the colony's case and that their consideration was improper until the colony had a reply to its earlier protests.\nIn the final days of the session, after many opponents had left the city, Patrick Henry introduced his measures and made the famous speech in which he said \u201cCaesar had his Brutus, Charles the First had his Cromwell, and George the Third . . .\u201d prompting cries of treason from the remaining burgesses present. Peyton Randolph, though not yet Speaker, was presiding. When Speaker John Robinson resumed the chair the following day (May 30), Henry carried five of his resolves by a single ballot. A tie would have allowed Robinson to cast the deciding \"nay.\" Jefferson, standing at the chamber door, said Peyton Randolph emerged saying, \"By God, I would have given one hundred guineas for a single vote.\"\nPatrick Henry left town, and the next day his fifth (and most radical) resolution was expunged by the burgesses who remained. Nevertheless, it was reprinted with the others in newspapers across the colonies as if it stood.\nSpeaker of the House of Burgesses\nPeyton Randolph was elected Speaker on November 6, 1766, succeeding the deceased Robinson and defeating Richard Henry Lee. Peyton's brother John succeeded him as attorney general the following June. By now the brothers had begun to disagree politically; John's conservatism would take him to England in 1775 while Peyton joined the rebellion.\nLeads rebel meeting at Raleigh Tavern\nAnother set of Patrick Henry's resolves, against the Townshend Duties, came before the House in May 1769. This time Peyton Randolph approved their passage, but Governor Botetourt did not. He dissolved the assembly. The \"former representatives of the people,\" as they called themselves, met the next day at the Raleigh Tavern with Speaker Peyton Randolph in the chair. They adopted a compact drafted by George Mason and introduced by George Washington against the importation of British goods. Speaker Randolph was the first to sign.\nWhen the new legislature met in the winter, the governor was pleased to announce the repeal of all of the Townshend Duties, except the small one on tea. Legislative attention turned to other, calmer affairs. The next summer Peyton Randolph became chairman of the building committee for the Public Hospital.\nClosing of Boston Harbor troubles Virginia burgesses\nTempers flared again in 1773, when Great Britain proposed to transport a band of Rhode Island smugglers to England for trial. The implications for Virginia were troublesome, and the burgesses appointed a standing Committee of Correspondence and Inquiry with Speaker Peyton Randolph as chairman. The following May brought word of the closing of the port of Boston in retaliation for its Tea Party.\nOn May 24, 1774, Robert Carter Nicholas introduced a resolution drafted by Thomas Jefferson that read:\n\"This House, being deeply impressed with apprehension of the great dangers, to be derived to British America, from the hostile Invasion of the City of Boston, in our Sister Colony of Massachusetts bay, whose commerce and harbour are, on the first Day of June next, to be stopped by an Armed force, deem it highly necessary that the said first day of June be set apart, by the Members of this House, as a day of Fasting, Humiliation and Prayer, devoutly to implore the divine interposition for averting the heavy Calamity which threatens destruction to our Civil Rights, and the Evils of civil War; to give us one heart and one Mind to firmly oppose, by all just and proper means, every injury to American Rights; and that the Minds of his Majesty and his parliament, may be inspired from above with Wisdom, Moderation, and Justice, to remove from the loyal People of America, all cause of danger, from a continued pursuit of Measure, pregnant with their ruin.\"\nThe resolution was adopted.\nHouse of Burgesses dissolved\nGovernor Dunmore summoned the house on May 26, 1774 and told Peyton Randolph: \"Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen of the House of Burgesses, I have in my hand a paper published by order of your House, conceived in such terms as reflect highly upon His Majesty and the Parliament of Great Britain, which makes it necessary for me to dissolve you; and you are accordingly dissolved.\"\nContinental Congress proposed\nOn May 27, 1774, a group of 89 burgesses gathered again at the Raleigh Tavern to form another \u201cnon-importation association,\u201d and the following day the Committee of Correspondence proposed a Continental Congress. Twenty-five burgesses met at Peyton Randolph's house on May 30 and scheduled a state convention to be held on August 1 to consider a proposal from Boston for a ban on exports to England.\nPeyton Randolph led the community to Bruton Parish Church on June 1 to pray for Boston, and soon he was organizing a Williamsburg drive to send provisions and cash for its relief. The First Virginia Convention approved the export ban and elected as delegates to the Congress Peyton Randolph, Richard Henry Lee, George Washington, Patrick Henry, Richard Bland, Benjamin Harrison, and Edmund Pendleton.\nSigns will before departure for the First Continental Congress\nBefore he left Williamsburg on August 18, 1774, Peyton Randolph wrote his will, leaving his property to the use of his wife for life. They had no children. The property was to be auctioned after her death and the proceeds divided among Randolph's heirs.\nUnanimously elected chairman of Continental Congress\nWhen Congress convened in Philadelphia on September 5, Thomas Lynch of South Carolina nominated Peyton Randolph to be chairman. He was elected by unanimous vote. Delegate Silas Deane wrote his wife, \"Designed by nature for the business, of an affable, open and majestic deportment, large in size, though not out of proportion, he commands respect and esteem by his very aspect, independent of the high character he sustains.\"\n500 merchants sign trade ban against England\nIn October 1774, Peyton Randolph returned to Williamsburg to preside at an impending meeting of the house. Repeatedly postponed, it did not meet until the following June. Nonetheless, on November 9 Peyton Randolph accepted a copy of the Continental Association banning trade with England signed by nearly 500 merchants gathered in Williamsburg.\nDisperses angry crowd gathered at courthouse in Williamsburg\nPeyton Randolph was in the chair again at the Second Virginia Convention in Richmond on March 23 when Patrick Henry rose and made his \"Liberty or Death\" speech in favor of the formation of a statewide militia. In reaction, Governor Dunmore removed the gunpowder from Williamsburg's Magazine on April 21. Alerted to the theft, a mob gathered at the courthouse. Peyton Randolph was one of the leaders who persuaded the crowd to disperse and averted violence.\nBritish put Randolph on rebel execution list\nPeyton Randolph led the Virginia delegation to the Second Continental Congress in May 1775, and he again took the chair. General Thomas Gage, commander of British forces in America, had been issued blank warrants for the execution of rebel leaders and a list of names with which to fill them. Peyton Randolph's name was on the list. He returned to Williamsburg under guard, and the town bells pealed to announce his safe arrival. The militia escorted him to his house and pledged to guarantee his safety.\nThe Third Virginia Convention reelected its speaker to Congress in July 1775, and Randolph left for Philadelphia in late August or early September. By this time, John Hancock had succeeded him to its chair.\nDied before Independence\nAbout 8 p.m. on Sunday, October 23, Peyton Randolph began to choke, a side of his face contorted, and he died of an \"apoplectic stroke.\" He was buried that Tuesday at Christ's Church in Philadelphia. His nephew, Edmund Randolph, brought his remains to Williamsburg in 1776, and he was interred in the family crypt in the Chapel at the College of William and Mary on November 26.\nPeyton Randolph's estate was auctioned on February 19, 1783, following the death of his widow Betty Randolph. Thomas Jefferson bought his books. Among them were bound records dating to Virginia's earliest days that still are consulted by historians. Added to the collection at Monticello that Jefferson sold to the federal government years later, they became part of the core of the Library of Congress.\nFor further reading:","id":"<urn:uuid:2e1e4fc1-e4fe-49ae-aa7b-90e0301cdcec>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/history.org\/almanack\/people\/bios\/biorapey.cfm?showSite=mobile","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9792050719,"token_count":2999,"score":2.8125,"int_score":3}

He went towards the east, and kept going, kept going. His brothers staid under a bush. Then, after he had gone some ways, he hung up one quiver of arrows, and went on. He kept going, kept going, and then a little ways off he hung up another quiver of arrows. He went on, kept going, and again a short ways off he came to a valley, a large valley.\nWhen he had looked down into it here and there, (he saw) there were brown bears feeding, and grizzly bears also feeding, it is said. One was feeding there in the very middle (of the valley). And it was a white bear, it is said, a silver-tip. So he (Fisher), having crept down into (the valley), ready to shoot, shot him.\nThen from there (the bear) ran after him, jumped at him, trying to catch him. And he (Fisher) ran up out of the valley. Meanwhile he kept shooting, and still continued to run up out of the valley, the bear jumping at him to seize him. He kept shooting; he shot dodging from side to side, he shot whatever he had (?).\nMeanwhile (the bear) jumped at him to seize him in his mouth. He (Fisher) kept running away and when all his arrows were shot, he reached the place where he had left the arrows, and, taking them down, he ran on up. He kept on shooting, and still (the bear) jumped at him to seize him in his mouth. Again it seems as if he came a little closer. He (Fisher) ran, dodging all the time, dodged as he ran. And meanwhile he shot. Only half his arrows were left, he had almost shot them all away.\nMeanwhile he ran on, he dodged, he shot. And, so doing, he shot all his arrows. And all being gone, he ran to the place where he had hung tip his arrows, and, having taken them down, he shot. The bear jumped to seize him in his arms, (but,) dodging as he ran, (Fisher) kept\np. 226 p. 227\nshooting. So continually shooting, (the bear) coming running up pretty close, he shot, dodging as he ran. And, so doing, he ran round and about the place where he had made his brothers stay. Meanwhile (the bear) still ran after him. And while he was doing thus, he (Fisher) killed him.\nThen he spoke. \"You shall be bad. You shall not trouble mortal men when they see you,\" he said, speaking after he had killed him. \"You shall not hunt to seize mortal men coming into the middle of this world. That, mortal men in story-telling, (shall say) of you. Then, 'Silver-Tip in the olden time killed people, (was) a killer, they say. Killing them, he was sent away from this world, they say. And then, they say, there were no Silver-Tips.' That (is what) mortal men (will) be saying of you,\" he said.\nThen he said, \"Well, my brother! You must live on, staying in this sort of a place, staying squatting down under bushes. I shall be a traveller in this world in all countries; but you will be one who shall stay travelling about in this country only, going about only in this country,\" said he, speaking. Then he went on. \"Well,\" said he, \"I am going,\" said he. \"Stay there!\" said he, and he went off. And when he looked back, the ears (of the Cottontail) were shimmering (quivering?). So he went off, after looking back. That is all, it is said.","id":"<urn:uuid:f9fa968d-5214-44df-9dc6-4f69c5398e40>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.sacred-texts.com\/nam\/ca\/mdut\/mdut18.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9923661947,"token_count":2078,"score":2.6875,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Young Kids May Be Able to Unbuckle Car Seats\nSurvey of Parents Finds Some Kids May Be Unbuckling While Car Is in Motion\nMay 2, 2011 -- Children as young as 1 year old can unbuckle themselves from car safety seats, a new survey of parents finds.\n\"We found that children can unbuckle from their child car safety seats by their fourth birthday, and there is an alarming 43% who do so when the car is in motion,\" says researcher Lilia Reyes, MD, a clinical fellow in pediatric emergency medicine at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven. \"It was reported as early as 12 months.\"\nThe findings are being presented at the Pediatric Academic Societies annual meeting in Denver.\nChild Car Seats: How Secure?\nWhile working in the pediatric emergency room at Yale, Reyes encountered two different mothers who had minor car accidents. They told her it happened when they turned their heads around after discovering their kids had unbuckled themselves.\nTrying to determine how frequently it happened, she and her colleagues from Yale surveyed 378 parents of young children. Among the other findings:\n- 51% or about 191 families reported that at least one of their children had unbuckled their car seats. Of these, 75% were age 3 or younger. The youngest was 12 months old.\n- Boys unbuckled more than girls; 59% of the kids who unbuckled were boys.\nParents were not asked if they were sure they had buckled correctly, Reyes tells WebMD. So there is a possibility the children weren't buckled in correctly. But parents do typically hear a click, like a seat safety belt, when the buckle latches, she says.\nThe problem, she says, is that while children may be able to physically unbuckle the seat, they are just beginning, at around age 3, to develop reasoning skills to appreciate the consequences of unbuckling.\nParents used seats of various types. They included the five-point harness, convertible seats, and booster seats, depending on their child's age and weight.\nAre Car Seats Really Buckled?\n''This study raises questions about how the child restraint was used,\" says Lorrie Walker, training manager and technical advisor for Safe Kids USA, an advocacy group.\n\"Federal motor vehicle safety standard 213 requires the buckle to release using between 9 and 14 pounds of pressure,\" she says. \"It is often challenging for an adult to unbuckle the harness.\"\nShe wonders if the buckle was not adequately locked in some cases.\n\"A buckle may give the appearance of being buckled when it has not completely latched,\" she tells WebMD.\nAmong the mistakes many parents make when placing a child in a car seat she says, is to loosely attach the harness straps or place the straps in the wrong harness slots.\nIf these mistakes occur, she says, it makes it easy for a child to climb out.\nThe finding that a child as young as age 1 could unbuckle the seat is a surprise to Jennifer Stockburger, program manager of vehicle and child safety for Consumer Reports. She reviewed the findings for WebMD but was not involved in the study.","id":"<urn:uuid:bf010e52-2673-4816-a6a6-269d9a7121ee>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/children.webmd.com\/news\/20110429\/young-kids-may-be-able-to-unbuckle-car-seats","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9828870893,"token_count":653,"score":2.78125,"int_score":3}

{"text":"African Americans in the Bluegrass\nWhether you are spending a day, a week or longer in the Bluegrass Region, you and your family will learn fascinating information about African Americans. Gleanings from your travels will become answers to questions that you might not ever have thought to ask.\nHistory in the Heart of Downtown\nThe public square at the center of downtown was platted in 1780 as the site of the courthouse for the newly established town of Lexington. The square has always been, and still is, a place where significant events and community activities have occurred. Archive records tell of a fight between a school teacher and a wildcat, controversial slave auctions, military drills, Civil War skirmishes, riots, hangings, speeches and fires that destroyed previous courthouses. This history has been inclusive of African Americans both enslaved and free.\nBy 1789, an area of the square had been designated as a marketplace and named after the market in London, England - Cheapside (old English ceapan means to buy). William Tucker (1787-1837), a free African American, was one of the merchants who advertised the sale of household items and spices from his stall. Farmers and others, during their monthly visits to transact legal business, bought, sold and swapped livestock and agricultural products. The sale activity, known as Court Day, ended in 1921. Historian J. Winston Coleman, Jr. documented two dozen dealers in Lexington who bought and sold the enslaved between 1833 and 1865. This commercial enterprise established Lexington as one of the largest slave markets in the south. The Cheapside Auction Block stood near Main Street in the general vicinity of the monument for J.C. Breckinridge. The historical marker giving an account of the sale of African Americans stands in the northeast courtyard on Short Street. It was placed on the former site of the whipping post, erected by order of town trustees in 1806.\nThe impressive Romanesque design courthouse, the fourth built on site, was erected between 1898 and 1900. The Tandy and Byrd Construction Company, owned by African Americans Henry Tandy and Albert Byrd, laid the brick under the stone fa\u00e7ade. In 2003 the building became the Lexington History Center; it closed in 2012 for renovation.\n|Blue Note: A number of nationally known individuals started their lives in Kentucky. Vertner Tandy (1885-1949), son of constructor Henry Tandy, became the first licensed architect in New York and a founding member of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternal organization. He designed the New York mansion of Madam C.J. Walker, the hair care product millionaire and Berea Hall dormitory on the campus of Lincoln Institute, Simpsonville.|\nIn 2009, Cheapside once again became an open-air market when area farmers and merchants began selling fresh produce and food products every Saturday from April through November. The pavilion also serves as performance space for musicians during \u201cThursday Night Live\u201d and shelters those who attend local festivals, events and celebrations.\nWalk around the square to read the wayside markers and stroll our downtown streets to view other points of interest. Historical Highway Markers are located throughout Lexington. Those highlighting African American history include: Doctors' offices at 118 N. Broadway; Historic Pleasant Green Baptist Church at 540 Maxwell Street; Lyman T. Johnson who integrated the University of Kentucky on Administration Drive; Polk\/Dalton Infirmary at 148 Deweese Street; African Cemetery No. 2 at 419 East Seventh Street; The Colored Orphan Home at 644 Georgetown Street; The Agricultural and Mechanical Fair of Colored People at Georgetown Street past Nandino Drive; and Maddoxtown Community on Huffman Mill Road. Main Street Baptist Church will be placing a marker at their church in 2013 celebrating 150 years at their West Main Street location.\n|Blue Note: The Aviation Museum at Bluegrass Airport off Man-O-War Boulevard and U.S. Hwy 60 has an exhibit about the Tuskegee Airmen of Kentucky as well as other aviation history. 4316 Hanger Drive, behind the airport. (859)231-1219.|\nEquine Industry Superstars\nPlan a visit to the Kentucky Horse Park by traveling down Hwy 922, Newtown Pike, to Iron Works Pike. On the way, you\u2019ll pass the Coldstream Research Farm on the left. It was once the thoroughbred breeding farm McGrathiana, owned by H.P. McGrath. On this farm worked Oliver Lewis, the African American jockey who won the inaugural Kentucky Derby in 1875. The winning thoroughbred was Aristides, trained by renowned African American Ansel Williamson. Williamson was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1998. Outlining a portion of the original boundary of the farm is a rock wall fence. A sign designates that it was crafted by African American masons who had replaced the Scottish and Irish immigrant stone masons of the 1840s and 1850s.\nAdmission to the Kentucky Horse Park includes both the International Museum of the Horse and the American Saddle Horse Museum. African Americans were the national sports superstars during the early development of the thoroughbred racing and Saddlebred horse industries. There are memorials to Isaac Murphy, the first African American jockey to win three Kentucky Derbies, and the famous thoroughbred, Man-O-War and his groom, Will Harbut. \"The Buffalo Soldiers of the Western Frontier\" is a permanent exhibit housed in the International Museum of the Horse. Pick up a DVD produced by the American Saddlebred Association entitled \"Out of the Shadows\", the story of African American trainers and owners. (859)233-4303.\n|Blue Note: The rock fences seen as you travel the roadways are of limestone that was uncovered in fields being cultivated for agriculture as well as quarried. Most were dry laid - without the use of mortar. The Lexington Fayette Urban County government has ordinances in place that encourage the preservation and restoration of area stone fences. The nonprofit Dry Stone Conservancy has taken on the task of preserving and restoring the stone fences by conducting workshops to train new masons in old techniques. Look for signs that designate the dates, styles and builders of these fences.|\nAfrican Americans played an important role in the development of the racing industry. Stop by the Lexington Public Library downtown and you\u2019ll see a mural highlighting a number of influential early African American jockeys, and the world\u2019s largest ceiling clock as well! (859)231-5501.\nThe Stories of Slaves and Soldiers\nAnother day's tour can take you just outside Lexington to Waveland, site of a restored historic mansion and slave quarters. Head south on Nicholasville Road, then turn right onto Waveland Museum Lane. The stone building where the enslaved were housed and worked has been preserved and furnished with period artifacts. The guides tell you the history of enslaved on the property in conjunction with the story of the Bryan family, relatives of Daniel Boone, who lived in the Mansion house. (859)272-3611.\nLeaving Waveland, turn right onto Hwy 27 again and travel south past Nicholasville, taking the 27 Bypass. Signs let you know you are approaching Camp Nelson, established in 1863 as a supply camp for the Union Army during the Civil War. It became the third largest recruitment and training center for African Americans who formed the regiments known as the United States Colored Troops. Kentucky recruiters enlisted 23,700 African Americans, primarily among those who were enslaved. Some 10,000 began their training at Camp Nelson.\nThe camp originally encompassed 4,000 acres and held 300 buildings which were dismantled following the war. The house that was used as headquarters was saved and has been restored. Guided tours are available. A self guided tour of the grounds will lead you to the camp's earthen fortifications which are being restored. A number of artifacts which have been unearthed can be viewed in the interpretive center, a replica of a barracks. Camp Nelson Heritage Park was added to the National Parks Underground Railroad Network to Freedom in 2007.\nThe third weekend in September, the park celebrates Camp Nelson Days. The site comes alive with re-enactors of the 12th Heavy Regiment of the USCT and other military units. Lectures and demonstrations (firing of the cannon, cavalry charges, open fire cooking) help you experience some of what camp life was like for the soldiers as well as the families who escaped slavery and became free.\nAdjacent to the Heritage Park is the National Military Cemetery. In an original section, the grave sites of African American soldiers can be found. Check the list of those who are interred to see if you might have relatives who were veterans.\nJust beyond the park are several Kentucky Highway Markers that tell the history as it relates to the formation of the Hall community and the Ariel school established following the closing of the camp. (859)881-5716.\n|Blue Note: The town of Nicholasville is the birthplace of Morgan and Marvin Smith, the twin brothers whose photography captured images of Harlem, New York between 1935 and 1952.|\nCousins of Influence\nLexington and Richmond are the locations of homes of two influential men who were cousins. Ashland, the Henry Clay Estate is located at 120 Sycamore Drive, just off Richmond Road. At its zenith, the estate encompassed over 600 acres which were developed, cultivated and harvested by 50 enslaved at one time by Mr. Clay's telling. The farming operations also included active livestock breeding of horses, sheep and cattle. An interpretive history of the work performed by the enslaved in the management of the farm and household is presented. There are archival panels along with a sketch of Charles Dupuy, a member of the family responsible for the personal care of the Clay household. The Dupuy family traveled to Washington, D.C. when Henry Clay was appointed Secretary of State in 1825 and lived in the Decatur house, the Clay\u2019s official residence. The story of Charlotte Dupuy's lawsuit filed in 1829, petitioning for her freedom as well as that of her two children, is truly fascinating. Charlotte did not win the suit, but Henry Clay did finally emancipate her and her two children, Charles and Mary Ann, in the 1840s. There are archive photos of the T.H. Hummons' family and other African Americans who were employed in the household from the 1900s to 1964. (859)266-8581.\nFrom the Henry Clay estate, turn right onto Richmond Road and take I-75 South to Richmond, exit 95, to discover White Hall State Historic Site, the home of Henry Clay's cousin. The road leads to the home of Cassius Marcellus Clay - not the boxer - but the man who served as Ambassador to Russia during Abraham Lincoln's presidency. Cassius became an ardent emancipationist, having freed 50 of those enslaved to him in 1844. He printed the True American, a newspaper in 1845 promoting the emancipation of the enslaved. White Hall, a 44 room Italianate mansion, makes an impressive appearance as you approach the entrance.\n|Blue Note: Cassius M. Clay supported the founding of Berea College in 1855, donating both land and money. Founder John G. Fee promoted the idea of a school where students from the Appalachian region could be educated regardless of race and income. Julia Britton, grandmother of Benjamin Hooks, Director of the NAACP, John H. Jackson, first president of Kentucky State University and Carter G. Woodson, founder of Black History Week, were graduates. The college is located in Berea, KY, just south of Richmond. You can spend a full day in the town enjoying the food, crafts and history.|\nAt the right rear of the house is a stone building that was used as housing and workspace for the enslaved. Several of the original outbuildings have also been restored. One serves as the Gift Shop and location for admission to the home. There are picnic tables and restroom facilities, so plan for lunch or a late afternoon snack on the grounds. (859)623-9178\nAn Afternoon in Paris\nA scenic drive to Paris will take you past historic horse farms and more rock wall fences. Take Broadway\/Paris Pike, Hwy 68 North from Lexington. One of the first stops should be the Thoroughbred Training Center located at 3380 Paris Pike. This facility actually trains future champion horses. You do need to be there before 9 a.m. if you want to see the horses put through their paces. Observing the work here will help you understand what is involved in the care and preparation of thoroughbreds for their careers in racing.\nIn earlier times, the tasks you observe would have been performed by African Americans, many of whom were children and young males. At age seven and eight, they started working in the barns and stables. By ten years of age some were being mounted on the horses as exercisers. Jockeys Isaac Murphy and William Walker began riding at the age of 11 and Raleigh Colston, Jr. rode in his first Kentucky Derby at the age of 13 in 1875. (859)293-1853. Reservations recommended.\nIf you have stopped at the training center, return to Paris Pike and continue into town. Visit the Hopewell Museum, (859)987-7274, located in the old Paris post office at 800 Pleasant Street. There is a permanent display featuring Garrett Morgan, inventor of the traffic signal and gas mask. Look for the Kentucky Historical Highway Marker at 10th and Vine Streets that marks the birthplace of Garrett Morgan.\nSeveral quaint, independently owned restaurants make great lunch or dinner stops to round out your afternoon in Paris.\nA Hamlet and a Railroad Town\nLeaving Lexington from another direction, head west on Leestown Road (Hwy 421) and you\u2019ll pass an African American community established in 1865 by Frederick Braxton, founder and minister of the Main Street Baptist Church in Lexington. He had purchased land and sold small acreage to other blacks after emancipation. They named the community in his honor, Bracktown.\nStay on Hwy 421 until you reach Midway. Turn left at Hwy 62 which will lead you to town. Don't be surprised to find that the railroad tracks run through the middle of the street. When goods were delivered by rail, it made it convenient to off load supplies directly to stores. On Railroad Street, a marker pays tribute to Edward Dudley \"Dick\" Brown. He was born into slavery in Lexington about 1848. R.A. Alexander purchased him at auction around 1856 and brought him to the Woodburn farm in Woodford County where he began his career as a stable boy. He eventually advanced to exerciser, jockey, trainer and finally owner of his own thoroughbred, Ben Brush, 1896 Kentucky Derby winner. Also in town are Historical Markers detailing the history of the Second Christian Church, Smith Street; Pilgrim Baptist Church, 133 East Stephen Street and St. Matthews AME Church, 112 S. Winter Street. They are within walking distance from Railroad Street.\nA Capital Idea\nLeaving Midway, get back on Hwy 421 and follow it into Frankfort, Kentucky\u2019s capital. Take the by-pass until you see the sign directing you to Kentucky State University. Founded in 1887 by act of legislature, it became the first state supported school to train African Americans to become teachers. John H. Jackson, a native of Lexington, became its first president. Recitation Hall was the first building completed in 1887 by stone mason, James C. Brown. The building was renamed Jackson Hall and placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The building is now the office\/museum of the Center of Excellence for the Study of Kentucky African Americans. Visit the Welcome Center to view a display on African American history. Visitor permit parking is available.\nOther sites to visit in Frankfort are the Memorial to United States Colored Troops at the Greenhill Cemetery, the Kentucky Military History Museum, the Thomas D. Clark Center for Kentucky History, Kentucky State Capitol and Old State Capitol. Historic Markers are located at St. John AME Church, 210 West Clinton; 1st Baptist Church at 100 W. Clinton and Emily Thomas Tubman House on Washington Street.\nFor more information call the Lexington Convention and Visitors Bureau at 800-845-3959.\nWritten by Yvonne Giles, December 2008","id":"<urn:uuid:88da4d25-3083-404d-80d8-d5a552c80292>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.visitlex.com\/idea\/african-americans.php","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9645776749,"token_count":3402,"score":3.40625,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Millennial themes: age, education, services\nDecember 01, 1999\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics recently released its work force projections for the period 1998-2008.\nSome of the themes that may be important to watch unfolding over the next several years include:\n- The continuing aging of the labor force. The median age of workers is projected to rise to nearly 41 years. At that level, the median age of the labor force will just exceed the previous high of 40.5 years reached in 1962.\n- The growing importance of education. Occupations that require at least an associate degree will account for 40 percent of all job growth out to 2008, compared to a one-quarter share of all jobs that existed in 1998.\n- The dominance of the service-producing sector as a source of employment growth. In the projection period\u20141998 to 2008\u2014the service sector will account for more than 90 percent of job growth.\nProjections of the labor force and the industrial and occupational composition of employment are a product of the Employment Projections program.

{"text":"In addition, health issues, such as pain, asthma, restless legs syndrome, and back problems, also can contribute to lack of sleep. So can some medications, such as decongestants, steroids and some medicines for high blood pressure, asthma or depression.\nSecrets of good sleep\nYou can take steps to shift your body and mind into more beneficial sleep habits:\n- Keep your bedroom dark, quiet, comfortable and cool. \u201cMaking your bedroom a sanctuary conducive for sleep can make a significant difference in the quality of sleep you get,\u201d says Dr. Wolfson.\n- Go to sleep and wake up at the same time, even on weekends. Doing so helps keep your internal \u201ccircadian clock\u201d in balance, which signals your body to sleep and wake in a regular pattern.\n- Establish a regular, relaxing bedtime routine that might include reading a book, listening to soothing music or doing something else you find relaxing. \u201cA relaxing, routine activity right before bedtime helps separate your sleep time from activities that can make it more difficult to fall asleep or remain asleep,\u201d says Dr. Wolfson. \u201cParents know that a bedtime routine can help children get a good night\u2019s sleep. Doing the same for themselves can have the same results.\u201d\n- Make sure your mattress is comfortable and supportive. Good-quality mattresses generally last about 10 years. Have comfortable pillows and make the room attractive and inviting.\n- Avoid caffeine close to bedtime. Caffeine products, such as coffee, tea and colas, remain in the body, on average, from three to five hours, but they can affect some people up to 12 hours later.\n- Avoid alcohol close to bedtime. Many people think of alcohol as a sedative, but it actually disrupts sleep, causing nighttime awakenings.\n- Quit smoking. Nicotine is a stimulant that can make it more difficult for smokers to fall asleep, stay asleep and wake in the morning. Smokers should never smoke in bed or when they\u2019re sleepy.\n- Finish eating at least two or three hours before your regular bedtime. Be aware that large, high-fat or spicy meals may cause heartburn, which leads to difficulty falling asleep and discomfort during the night.\n- Exercise regularly but complete your workout at least a few hours before bedtime. Exercising regularly makes it easier to fall asleep and contributes to sounder sleep. However, working out right before going to bed will make falling asleep more difficult.\n- Find ways to manage stress and anxiety. Relaxation exercises, meditation or deep breathing work for many people.\n\u201cIf there are problems or issues keeping you awake, try writing them in a notebook and putting it away,\u201d suggests Dr. Wolfson. \u201cThat way, you\u2019ve registered your concerns but become free to put them aside until morning.\u201d\nWhen to seek help\nIf your sleep problems persist for longer than a week and are bothersome, or if sleepiness interferes with the way you feel or function during the day, don\u2019t self-medicate with sleeping pills; make an appointment with your doctor.\n\u201cThe key to better sleep is recognizing you\u2019re not getting enough deep, restorative sleep, and then doing something about it,\u201d says Dr. Wolfson. \u201cFailure to do so puts you and others at risk.\u201d","id":"<urn:uuid:1cbff567-0d53-485f-b0da-b9c3af53d7f1>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.kcra.com\/Gets-the-ZZZs-you-need\/-\/11798090\/18014276\/-\/item\/1\/-\/14d2jl9\/-\/index.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9462397695,"token_count":712,"score":2.75,"int_score":3}
{"text":"The National Cattlemen's Beef Association has criticized a review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Particulate Matter. Conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the study was done as part of a required review of the coarse particulate matter standards. In effect, EPA is looking at the impact of duct.\nAccording to a statement from NCBA, coarse particulate matter is \"nothing more than dust kicked up by cars and trucks traveling on dirt roads, a tractor tilling a field or cattle moving around on dirt,\" says Tamara Theis, NCBA's chief environmental council. \"Studies do not show that rural dust is a health problem.\"\nEPA, back in 2006, set a coarse particulate matter standard of 150 micrograms per cubic meter of air, and when reviewing the standard in 2008, determined that the evidence on health effects from this level of dust was inconclusive. However, in July 2009, EPA reinterpreted what NCBA calls \"the inconclusive evidence\" and made use of what the group calls a flawed study to suggest that there are adverse health effects from dust at leves that are 10 times lower than the current standard.\nTheis says EPA is suggesting 12 to 15 micrograms of dust per cubic meter of air, which is below the naturally occurring levels of dust through most Western states - including \"pristine National Parks,\" she says. If EPA were to set air standards at this level, much of the country would be over the limit.\nCattle producers are concerned because it would limit the ability to raise livestock, but the issue goes beyond agriculture, Theis says. \"States would be required to impose extreme control requirements and limitations on many businesses to ensure that the standard is met.\"\nThe group is urging EPA to reject the study results and refrain from tightening the dust standard further.","id":"<urn:uuid:dac82ba8-16eb-4709-8603-56b19c9bed20>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/farmprogress.com\/story-beef-industry-group-questions-epa-dust-rule-analysis-0-32785","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9610844851,"token_count":376,"score":2.578125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Gaia theory is a class of scientific models of the geo-biosphere in which life as a whole fosters and maintains suitable conditions for itself by helping to create an environment on Earth suitable for its continuity. The first such theory was created by the atmospheric scientist and chemist, Sir James Lovelock, who developed his hypotheses in the 1960s before formally publishing the concept, first in the New Scientist (February 13, 1975) and then in the 1979 book \"Quest for Gaia\". He hypothesized that the living matter of the planet functioned like a single organism and named this self-regulating living system after the Greek goddess, Gaia, using a suggestion of novelist William Golding.\nGaia \"theories\" have non-technical predecessors in the ideas of several cultures. Today, \"Gaia theory\" is sometimes used among non-scientists to refer to hypotheses of a self-regulating Earth that are non-technical but take inspiration from scientific models. Among some scientists, \"Gaia\" carries connotations of lack of scientific rigor, quasi-mystical thinking about the planet arth, and therefore Lovelock's hypothesis was received initially with much antagonism by much of the scientific community. No controversy exists, however, that life and the physical environment significantly influence one another.\nGaia theory today is a spectrum of hypotheses, ranging from the undeniable (Weak Gaia) to the radical (Strong Gaia).\nAt one end of this spectrum is the undeniable statement that the organisms on the Earth have radically altered its composition. A stronger position is that the Earth's biosphere effectively acts as if it is a self-organizing system, which works in such a way as to keep its systems in some kind of meta-equilibrium that is broadly conducive to life. The history of evolution, ecology and climate show that the exact characteristics of this equilibrium intermittently have undergone rapid changes, which are believed to have caused extinctions and felled civilisations.\nBiologists and earth scientists usually view the factors that stabilize the characteristics of a period as an undirected emergent property or entelechy of the system; as each individual species pursues its own self-interest, for example, their combined actions tend to have counterbalancing effects on environmental change. Opponents of this view sometimes point to examples of life's actions that have resulted in dramatic change rather than stable equilibrium, such as the conversion of the Earth's atmosphere from a reducing environment to an oxygen-rich one. However, proponents will point out that those atmospheric composition changes created an environment even more suitable to life.\nSome go a step further and hypothesize that all lifeforms are part of a single living planetary being called Gaia. In this view, the atmosphere, the seas and the terrestrial crust would be results of interventions carried out by Gaia through the coevolving diversity of living organisms. While it is arguable that the Earth as a unit does not match the generally accepted biological criteria for life itself (Gaia has not yet reproduced, for instance), many scientists would be comfortable characterising the earth as a single \"system\".\nThe most extreme form of Gaia theory is that the entire Earth is a single unified organism; in this view the Earth's biosphere is consciously manipulating the climate in order to make conditions more conducive to life. Scientists contend that there is no evidence at all to support this last point of view, and it has come about because many people do not understand the concept of homeostasis. Many non-scientists instinctively see homeostasis as an activity that requires conscious control, although this is not so.\nMuch more speculative versions of Gaia theory, including all versions in which it is held that the Earth is actually conscious or part of some universe-wide evolution, are currently held to be outside the bounds of science.\nThis article is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License.

{"text":"An osteochondroma is the most common type of benign bone tumor. It arises from cartilage tissue in children and adolescents between the ages of 10 and 20, usually appearing on the long bones (arms and legs) and less often on the pelvic bones and wing bones (scapulae). An osteochondroma ordinarily stops growing when a person reaches full height.\nMost tissue in the body can grow beyond normal limits and form a mass, also known as a tumor. Tumors come in two forms: benign and malignant. The malignancies which are referred to as cancer, rarely stop growing. The benign tumors reach a certain size and then stop.\nBones can host at least ten different benign tumors, some of which turn into cancers. Less than 1% of osteochondromas turn into a bone cancer called chondrosarcoma, usually in later years.\nThe cause of osteochondroma remains unknown. A hereditary form of the disease is presumably related to one or more gene mutations (see below).\nThe following factors increase your chance of developing osteochondroma. If you have any of these risk factors, tell your doctor:\nIf you experience any of these symptoms do not assume it is due to osteochondroma. These symptoms may be caused by other, more serious health conditions.

This involves a general or regional anesthetic and a few days in the hospital. If the bone is weakened by the surgery, the surgeon may need to rebuild it, and the recovery time may be extended to weeks or months.\nSince remnants of the tumor may remain after surgery, your doctor may want to retest you every few years to make sure it doesn\u2019t start to grow again.\nDepartment of Orthopaedic Surgery, Johns Hopkins University\nCanadian Orthopaedic Association\nChildhood Cancer Foundation\nPatel SR, Benjamin RS.

{"text":"\u201cI think every kid has picked up an interesting rock,\u201d she said. \u201cHave you ever picked up a rock that\u2019s shaped like a heart? That\u2019s shaped like a potato? That\u2019s shaped like a bird? Maybe it had a pretty color or had crystals in it. Just about everybody as a child has collected some kind of rock.\u201d\nIn this case, treasure has nothing to do with money, unless that includes the money Roberts has invested in her rock hound habit.\nShe was one of those children who picked up pretty rocks, but her appreciation never went away. Today, she\u2019s president of the North Mississippi Gem and Mineral Society, a group of like-minded people who think good things can be found by looking down.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t do a lot digging. You\u2019re looking at the surface or just below the surface,\u201d said Roberts, 61, of Counce, Tenn. \u201cA lot of material comes to the surface after a heavy rain. If you\u2019re collecting a day or two after a heavy rain, you need your mud boots on. Mississippi is known for its ooey, gooey clay.\u201d\nThe society has regular field trips to hunt for new rocks and minerals. In these litigious days, it\u2019s important to get permission from land owners before the searching begins.\nProvisions include a rock hammer, shovel and safety glasses, as well as containers to hold fresh finds and a screwdriver to pry things up, Roberts said.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to pack your own lunch and water,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of the places we collect at are old quarries, so there aren\u2019t any facilities. You have to be pretty self- sufficient.\u201d\nSociety members have loaned some of their finds for an exhibit at the Oren Dunn City Museum in Tupelo\u2019s Ballard Park. The collection includes items on loan from the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science in Jackson.\nThe \u201cMississippi\u2019s Geologic History: Written in Stone\u201d exhibit features fossilized sea life from the Mississippian period, which was 323 to 363 million years ago, as well as clay from Monroe County used to make kitty litter. Crystals, geodes and petrified wood also are included. The rare and common rocks, minerals and fossils will be on display until March 23.\nSelf-described rock hounds come to the hobby in different ways. While Roberts likes to put on her mud boots and hunt for fossils, John Byzet, 65, of Tupelo, has other ways of attaining new rocks.\n\u201cI go on some field trips, but not many. Some of it is mail order. Some of it is swap meets. Some of it is friends,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\u2019ve got a friend going to Africa, I say, \u2018Pick me up a rock or two.\u2019 I\u2019ve got a friend going to Israel. He\u2019ll pick me up malachite.\u201d\nWhen he gets hold of stones, Byzet likes to cut them into facets to reveal their beauty.\n\u201cMostly it\u2019s amethyst,\u201d he said. \u201cI like that rock. It\u2019s got a nice, purple glimmer to it.\u201d\nByzet got into collecting as a child, when a neighbor introduced him to the hobby. He didn\u2019t know it at the time, but that neighbor and her husband were responsible for a semi-precious stone exhibit at a San Diego museum.\n\u201cShe gave me my first collection,\u201d Byzet said.\nRocks lost their appeal for Byzet over the years, and he put them away until about three or four years ago, when he saw them again through youthful eyes.\n\u201cMy grandson was up here and saw some and he drew me back into it. I\u2019ve been enjoying it. I\u2019ve learned a lot. You can\u2019t help but learn if you do it and piddle around,\u201d said Byzet, who maintains the society\u2019s website, www.nmgms.org.\nAt its monthly meetings at the Lee County Library, the society holds workshops on various aspects of the hobby.

She tells you that there are too many does running around, eating crops and destroying property, and she wants you to help cull the herd. She states that she does not want anyone to shoot the antlered deer just the does. She gives you four special non-antlered damage tags, and you have your own state antlered tags. Does and bucks are legal to harvest. After sitting in the woods for hours, you hear a loud noise. You look over your shoulder and see the biggest antlered deer you have ever seen!

A researcher played with each dog in an isolated room for 20 minutes.\nThe next day the dogs were taken back to their rooms and left alone for five minutes while video cameras recorded their behavior.\nSome of the dogs barked, jumped on furniture, and scratched at the door, but the \u201coptimistic\u201d ones did not -- or didn\u2019t do it as much.\nTo study optimistic or pessimistic tendencies, the dogs were trained so that when a bowl was placed at one location in a room, it contained food, but when put somewhere else, it didn\u2019t. Then the bowls were placed at ambiguous locations between the positive and negative positions.\n\u201cDogs that ran fast to these ambiguous locations as if expecting the positive food reward were classed as making relatively \u2018optimistic\u2019 decisions,\u201d Mendl says in a news release. \"Interestingly, these dogs tended to be the ones who also showed least anxiety-like behavior when left alone for a short time.\u201d\nHe says about half of dogs may at some point engage in behaviors related to separation anxiety, such as barking, scratching, or tearing things up when separated from owners.\n\u201cOur study suggests that dogs showing these types of behavior also appear to make more pessimistic judgments generally,\u201d he says.\n\u201cWe all have a tendency to think that our pets and other animals experience emotions similar to our own, but we have no way of knowing directly because emotions are essentially private,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, we can use findings from human psychology research to develop new ways of measuring animal emotion.\u201d\nIt\u2019s known that the emotional states of people affect their judgments, and that happy people are more likely to judge an ambiguous situation in a positive way. And it\u2019s apparently the same with dogs.\n\u201cWhat our study has shown is that this applies similarly to dogs -- that a \u2018glass-half-full\u2019 dog is less likely to be anxious when left alone than one with a more pessimistic nature,\u201d Mendl says.","id":"<urn:uuid:52681c3d-daf8-4700-b8a8-2bd20c0f2f2d>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/pets.webmd.com\/dogs\/news\/20101013\/dogs-can-be-optimists-or-pessimists?src=rsf_full-1697_pub_none_rltd","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9756743312,"token_count":640,"score":3.03125,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Quantum Time Waits for No\nQuantum Theory, also quantum mechanics, in physics, a theory based\non using the concept of the quantum unit to describe the dynamic\nproperties of subatomic particles and the interactions of matter and\nradiation. The foundation was laid by the German physicist Max\nPlanck, who postulated in 1900 that energy can be emitted or\nabsorbed by matter only in small, discrete units called quanta.\nfundamental to the development of quantum mechanics was the\nuncertainty principle, formulated by the German physicist Werner\nHeisenberg in 1927, which states that the position and momentum of a\nsubatomic particle cannot be specified simultaneously.\nSpectral Lines of Atomic Hydrogen: When an electron makes a\ntransition from one energy level to another, the electron emits a\nphoton with a particular energy. These photons are then observed as\nemission lines using a spectroscope. The Lyman series involves\ntransitions to the lowest or ground state energy level.\nto the second energy level are called the Balmer series. These\ntransitions involve frequencies in the visible part of the spectrum.\nIn this frequency range each transition is characterized by a\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, Newtonian, or classical, mechanics\nappeared to provide a wholly accurate description of the motions of\nbodies\u2014for example, planetary motion. In the late 19th and early\n20th centuries, however, experimental findings raised doubts about\nthe completeness of Newtonian theory. Among the newer observations\nwere the lines that appear in the spectra of light emitted by heated\ngases, or gases in which electric discharges take place.\nmodel of the atom developed in the early 20th century by the English\nphysicist Ernest Rutherford, in which negatively charged electrons\ncircle a positive nucleus in orbits prescribed by Newton\u2019s laws of\nmotion, scientists had also expected that the electrons would emit\nlight over a broad frequency range, rather than in the narrow\nfrequency ranges that form the lines in a spectrum.\nAnother puzzle for physicists was the coexistence of two theories of\nlight: the corpuscular theory, which explains light as a stream of\nparticles, and the wave theory, which views light as electromagnetic\nwaves. A third problem was the absence of a molecular basis for\nIn his book Elementary Principles in Statistical\nMechanics (1902), the American mathematical physicist J. Willard\nGibbs conceded the impossibility of framing a theory of molecular\naction that reconciled thermodynamics, radiation, and electrical\nphenomena as they were then understood.\nAt the turn of the century, physicists did not yet clearly recognize\nthat these and other difficulties in physics were in any way\nrelated. The first development that led to the solution of these\ndifficulties was Planck\u2019s introduction of the concept of the\nquantum, as a result of physicists\u2019 studies of blackbody radiation\nduring the closing years of the 19th century. (The term blackbody\nrefers to an ideal body or surface that absorbs all radiant energy\nwithout any reflection.)\nA body at a moderately high temperature \u2014 a\n\"red heat\" \u2014 gives off most of its radiation in the low frequency (red\nand infrared) regions; a body at a higher temperature \u2014 \"white\nheat\" \u2014 gives off comparatively more radiation in higher frequencies\n(yellow, green, or blue). During the 1890s physicists conducted\ndetailed quantitative studies of these phenomena and expressed their\nresults in a series of curves or graphs. The classical, or prequantum, theory predicted an altogether different set of curves\nfrom those actually observed.\nWhat Planck did was to devise a\nmathematical formula that described the curves exactly; he then\ndeduced a physical hypothesis that could explain the formula. His\nhypothesis was that energy is radiated only in quanta of energy hu,\nwhere u is the frequency and h is the quantum action, now known as\nThe next important developments in quantum mechanics were the work\nof German-born American physicist and Nobel laureate Albert\nEinstein. He used Planck\u2019s concept of the quantum to explain certain\nproperties of the photoelectric effect\u2014an experimentally observed\nphenomenon in which electrons are emitted from metal surfaces when\nradiation falls on these surfaces.\nAccording to classical theory, the energy, as measured by the\nvoltage of the emitted electrons, should be proportional to the\nintensity of the radiation. The energy of the electrons, however,\nwas found to be independent of the intensity of radiation\u2014which\ndetermined only the number of electrons emitted\u2014and to depend solely\non the frequency of the radiation. The higher the frequency of the\nincident radiation, the greater is the electron energy; below a\ncertain critical frequency no electrons are emitted. These facts\nwere explained by Einstein by assuming that a single quantum of\nradiant energy ejects a single electron from the metal.\nof the quantum is proportional to the frequency, and so the energy\nof the electron depends on the frequency.\nIn 1911 Rutherford established the existence of the atomic nucleus.\nHe assumed, on the basis of experimental evidence obtained from the\nscattering of alpha particles by the nuclei of gold atoms, that\nevery atom consists of a dense, positively charged nucleus,\nsurrounded by negatively charged electrons revolving around the\nnucleus as planets revolve around the sun.\nelectromagnetic theory developed by the British physicist James\nClerk Maxwell unequivocally predicted that an electron revolving\naround a nucleus will continuously radiate electromagnetic energy\nuntil it has lost all its energy, and eventually will fall into the\nnucleus. Thus, according to classical theory, an atom, as described\nby Rutherford, is unstable. This difficulty led the Danish physicist\nNiels Bohr, in 1913, to postulate that in an atom the classical\ntheory does not hold, and that electrons move in fixed orbits. Every\nchange in orbit by the electron corresponds to the absorption or\nemission of a quantum of radiation.\nThe application of Bohr\u2019s theory to atoms with more than one\nelectron proved difficult. The mathematical equations for the next\nsimplest atom, the helium atom, were solved during the 1910s and\n1920s, but the results were not entirely in accordance with\nFor more complex atoms, only approximate solutions of\nthe equations are possible, and these are only partly concordant\nThe French physicist Louis Victor de Broglie suggested in 1924 that\nbecause electromagnetic waves show particle characteristics,\nparticles should, in some cases, also exhibit wave properties. This\nprediction was verified experimentally within a few years by the\nAmerican physicists Clinton Joseph Davisson and Lester Halbert\nGermer and the British physicist George Paget Thomson.\nthat a beam of electrons scattered by a crystal produces a\ndiffraction pattern characteristic of a wave (see Diffraction). The\nwave concept of a particle led the Austrian physicist Erwin\nSchr\u00f6dinger to develop a so-called wave equation to describe the\nwave properties of a particle and, more specifically, the wave\nbehavior of the electron in the hydrogen atom.\nAlthough this differential equation was continuous and gave\nsolutions for all points in space, the permissible solutions of the\nequation were restricted by certain conditions expressed by\nmathematical equations called eigenfunctions (German eigen, \"own\").\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation thus had only certain discrete\nsolutions; these solutions were mathematical expressions in which\nquantum numbers appeared as parameters. (Quantum numbers are\nintegers developed in particle physics to give the magnitudes of\ncertain characteristic quantities of particles or systems.)\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation was solved for the hydrogen atom and gave\nconclusions in substantial agreement with earlier quantum theory.\nMoreover, it was solvable for the helium atom, which earlier theory\nhad failed to explain adequately, and here also it was in agreement\nwith experimental evidence. The solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation also indicated that no two electrons could have the same\nfour quantum numbers\u2014that is, be in the same energy state.\nrule, which had already been established empirically by\nAustro-American physicist and Nobel laureate Wolfgang Pauli in 1925,\nis called the exclusion principle.\nWhat is Matter\nIn the 20th century, physicists discovered that matter behaved as\nboth a wave and a particle. Austrian physicist and Nobel Prize\nwinner Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger discussed this apparent paradox in a\nlecture in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1952. A condensed and translated\nversion of his lecture appeared in Scientific American the following\nWhat Is Matter?\nThe wave-particle dualism afflicting modern physics is best resolved\nin favor of waves, believes the author, but there is no clear\npicture of matter on which physicists can agree\nFifty years ago science seemed on the road to a clear-cut answer to\nthe ancient question which is the title of this article. It looked\nas if matter would be reduced at last to its ultimate building\nblocks\u2014to certain submicroscopic but nevertheless tangible and\nmeasurable particles. But it proved to be less simple than that.\nToday a physicist no longer can distinguish significantly between\nmatter and something else. We no longer contrast matter with forces\nor fields of force as different entities; we know now that these\nconcepts must be merged. It is true that we speak of \"empty\" space\n(i.e., space free of matter), but space is never really empty,\nbecause even in the remotest voids of the universe there is always\nstarlight\u2014and that is matter. Besides, space is filled with\ngravitational fields, and according to Einstein gravity and inertia\ncannot very well be separated.\nThus the subject of this article is in fact the total picture of\nspace-time reality as envisaged by physics. We have to admit that\nour conception of material reality today is more wavering and\nuncertain than it has been for a long time. We know a great many\ninteresting details, learn new ones every week. But to construct a\nclear, easily comprehensible picture on which all physicists would\nagree\u2014that is simply impossible.\nPhysics stands at a grave crisis of\nideas. In the face of this crisis, many maintain that no objective\npicture of reality is possible. However, the optimists among us (of\nwhom I consider myself one) look upon this view as a philosophical\nextravagance born of despair. We hope that the present fluctuations\nof thinking are only indications of an upheaval of old beliefs which\nin the end will lead to something better than the mess of formulas\nwhich today surrounds our subject.\nSince the picture of matter that I am supposed to draw does not yet\nexist, since only fragments of it are visible, some parts of this\nnarrative may be inconsistent with others. Like Cervantes\u2019 tale of Sancho Panza, who loses his donkey in one chapter but a few chapters\nlater, thanks to the forgetfulness of the author, is riding the dear\nlittle animal again, our story has contradictions. We must start\nwith the well-established concept that matter is composed of\ncorpuscles or atoms, whose existence has been quite \"tangibly\"\ndemonstrated by many beautiful experiments, and with Max Planck\u2019s\ndiscovery that energy also comes in indivisible units, called\nquanta, which are supposed to be transferred abruptly from one\ncarrier to another.\nBut then Sancho Panza\u2019s donkey will return. For I shall have to ask\nyou to believe neither in corpuscles as permanent individuals nor in\nthe suddenness of the transfer of an energy quantum. Discreteness is\npresent, but not in the traditional sense of discrete single\nparticles, let alone in the sense of abrupt processes. Discreteness\narises merely as a structure from the laws governing the phenomena.\nThese laws are by no means fully understood; a probably correct\nanalogue from the physics of palpable bodies is the way various\npartial tones of a bell derive from its shape and from the laws of\nelasticity to which, of themselves, nothing discontinuous adheres.\nThe idea that matter is made up of ultimate particles was advanced\nas early as the fifth century B.C. by Leucippus and Democritus, who\ncalled these particles atoms. The corpuscular theory of matter was\nlifted to physical reality in the theory of gases developed during\nthe 19th century by James Clerk Maxwell and Ludwig Boltzmann. The\nconcept of atoms and molecules in violent motion, colliding and\nrebounding again and again, led to full comprehension of all the\nproperties of gases: their elastic and thermal properties, their\nviscosity, heat conductivity and diffusion. At the same time it led\nto a firm foundation of the mechanical theory of heat, namely, that\nheat is the motion of these ultimate particles, which becomes\nincreasingly violent with rising temperature.\nWithin one tremendously fertile decade at the turn of the century\ncame the discoveries of X-rays, of electrons, of the emission of\nstreams of particles and other forms of energy from the atomic\nnucleus by radioactive decay, of the electric charges on the various\nparticles. The masses of these particles, and of the atoms\nthemselves, were later measured very precisely, and from this was\ndiscovered the mass defect of the atomic nucleus as a whole.\nmass of a nucleus is less than the sum of the masses of its\ncomponent particles; the lost mass becomes the binding energy\nholding the nucleus firmly together. This is called the packing\neffect. The nuclear forces of course are not electrical forces\u2014those\nare repellent\u2014but are much stronger and act only within very short\ndistances, about 10-13 centimeter.\nHere I am already caught in a contradiction. Didn\u2019t I say at the\nbeginning that we no longer assume the existence of force fields\napart from matter? I could easily talk myself out of it by saying:\nWell, the force field of a particle is simply considered a part of\nit. But that is not the fact. The established view today is rather\nthat everything is at the same time both particle and field.\nEverything has the continuous structure with which we are familiar\nin fields, as well as the discrete structure with which we are\nequally familiar in particles. This concept is supported by\ninnumerable experimental facts and is accepted in general, though\nopinions differ on details, as we shall see.\nIn the particular case of the field of nuclear forces, the particle\nstructure is more or less known. Most likely the continuous force\nfield is represented by the so-called pi mesons. On the other hand,\nthe protons and neutrons, which we think of as discrete particles,\nindisputably also have a continuous wave structure, as is shown by\nthe interference patterns they form when diffracted by a crystal.\nThe difficulty of combining these two so very different character\ntraits in one mental picture is the main stumbling-block that causes\nour conception of matter to be so uncertain.\nNeither the particle concept nor the wave concept is hypothetical.\nThe tracks in a photographic emulsion or in a Wilson cloud chamber\nleave no doubt of the behavior of particles as discrete units. The\nartificial production of nuclear particles is being attempted right\nnow with terrific expenditure, defrayed in the main by the various\nstate ministries of defense. It is true that one cannot kill anybody\nwith one such racing particle, or else we should all be dead by now.\nBut their study promises, indirectly, a hastened realization of the\nplan for the annihilation of mankind which is so close to all our\nYou can easily observe particles yourself by looking at a luminous\nnumeral of your wrist watch in the dark with a magnifying glass. The\nluminosity surges and undulates, just as a lake sometimes twinkles\nin the sun. The light consists of sparklets, each produced by a\nso-called alpha particle (helium nucleus) expelled by a radioactive\natom which in this process is transformed into a different atom. A\nspecific device for detecting and recording single particles is the\nGeiger-M\u00fcller counter. In this short r\u00e9sum\u00e9 I cannot possibly\nexhaust the many ways in which we can observe single particles.\nNow to the continuous field or wave character of matter. Wave\nstructure is studied mainly by means of diffraction and\ninterference\u2014phenomena which occur when wave trains cross each\nother. For the analysis and measurement of light waves the principal\ndevice is the ruled grating, which consists of a great many fine,\nparallel, equidistant lines, closely engraved on a specular metallic\nLight impinging from one direction is scattered by them and\ncollected in different directions depending on its wavelength. But\neven the finest ruled gratings we can produce are too coarse to\nscatter the very much shorter waves associated with matter. The fine\nlattices of crystals, however, which Max von Laue first used as\ngratings to analyze the very short X-rays, will do the same for\n\"matter waves.\" Directed at the surface of a crystal, high-velocity\nstreams of particles manifest their wave nature. With crystal\ngratings physicists have diffracted and measured the wavelengths of\nelectrons, neutrons and protons.\nWhat does Planck\u2019s quantum theory have to do with all this? Planck\ntold us in 1900 that he could comprehend the radiation from red-hot\niron, or from an incandescent star such as the sun, only if this\nradiation was produced in discrete portions and transferred in such\ndiscrete quantities from one carrier to another (e.g., from atom to\nThis was extremely startling, because up to that time energy\nhad been a highly abstract concept. Five years later Einstein told\nus that energy has mass and mass is energy; in other words, that\nthey are one and the same. Now the scales begin to fall from our\neyes: our dear old atoms, corpuscles, particles are Planck\u2019s energy\nquanta. The carriers of those quanta are themselves quanta. One gets\ndizzy. Something quite fundamental must lie at the bottom of this,\nbut it is not surprising that the secret is not yet understood.\nAfter all, the scales did not fall suddenly. It took 20 or 30 years.\nAnd perhaps they still have not fallen completely.\nThe next step was not quite so far reaching, but important enough.\nBy an ingenious and appropriate generalization of Planck\u2019s\nhypothesis Niels Bohr taught us to understand the line spectra of\natoms and molecules and how atoms were composed of heavy, positively\ncharged nuclei with light, negatively charged electrons revolving\nEach small system\u2014atom or molecule\u2014can harbor only\ndefinite discrete energy quantities, corresponding to its nature or\nits constitution. In transition from a higher to a lower \"energy\nlevel\" it emits the excess energy as a radiation quantum of definite\nwavelength, inversely proportional to the quantum given off. This\nmeans that a quantum of given magnitude manifests itself in a\nperiodic process of definite frequency which is directly\nproportional to the quantum; the frequency equals the energy quantum\ndivided by the famous Planck\u2019s constant, h.\nAccording to Einstein a particle has the energy mc2, m being the\nmass of the particle and c the velocity of light. In 1925 Louis de Broglie drew the inference, which rather suggests itself, that a\nparticle might have associated with it a wave process of frequency\nmc2 divided by h. The particle for which he postulated such a wave\nwas the electron. Within two years the \"electron waves\" required by\nhis theory were demonstrated by the famous electron diffraction\nexperiment of C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer.\nThis was the starting\npoint for the cognition that everything \u2014 anything at all \u2014 is\nsimultaneously particle and wave field. Thus de Broglie\u2019s\ndissertation initiated our uncertainty about the nature of matter.\nBoth the particle picture and the wave picture have truth value, and\nwe cannot give up either one or the other. But we do not know how to\nThat the two pictures are connected is known in full generality with\ngreat precision and down to amazing details. But concerning the\nunification to a single, concrete, palpable picture opinions are so\nstrongly divided that a great many deem it altogether impossible. I\nshall briefly sketch the connection. But do not expect that a\nuniform, concrete picture will emerge before you; and do not blame\nthe lack of success either on my ineptness in exposition or your own\ndenseness\u2014nobody has yet succeeded.\nOne distinguishes two things in a wave. First of all, a wave has a\nfront, and a succession of wave fronts forms a system of surfaces\nlike the layers of an onion. You are familiar with the\ntwo-dimensional analogue of the beautiful wave circles that form on\nthe smooth surface of a pond when a stone is thrown in. The second\ncharacteristic of a wave, less intuitive, is the path along which it\ntravels\u2014a system of imagined lines perpendicular to the wave fronts.\nThese lines are known as the wave \"normals\" or \"rays.\"\nWe can make the provisional assertion that these rays correspond to\nthe trajectories of particles. Indeed, if you cut a small piece out\nof a wave, approximately 10 or 20 wavelengths along the direction of\npropagation and about as much across, such a \"wave packet\" would\nactually move along a ray with exactly the same velocity and change\nof velocity as we might expect from a particle of this particular\nkind at this particular place, taking into account any force fields\nacting on the particle.\nHere I falter. For what I must say now, though correct, almost\ncontradicts this provisional assertion. Although the behavior of the\nwave packet gives us a more or less intuitive picture of a particle,\nwhich can be worked out in detail (e.g., the momentum of a particle\nincreases as the wavelength decreases; the two are inversely\nproportional), yet for many reasons we cannot take this intuitive\npicture quite seriously. For one thing, it is, after all, somewhat\nvague, the more so the greater the wavelength. For another, quite\noften we are dealing not with a small packet but with an extended\nwave. For still another, we must also deal with the important\nspecial case of very small \"packelets\" which form a kind of\n\"standing wave\" which can have no wave fronts or wave normals.\nOne interpretation of wave phenomena which is extensively supported\nby experiments is this: At each position of a uniformly propagating\nwave train there is a twofold structural connection of interactions,\nwhich may be distinguished as \"longitudinal\" and \"transversal.\" The\ntransversal structure is that of the wave fronts and manifests\nitself in diffraction and interference experiments; the longitudinal\nstructure is that of the wave normals and manifests itself in the\nobservation of single particles. However, these concepts of\nlongitudinal and transversal structures are not sharply defined and\nabsolute, since the concepts of wave front and wave normal are not,\nThe interpretation breaks down completely in the special case of the\nstanding waves mentioned above. Here the whole wave phenomenon is\nreduced to a small region of the dimensions of a single or very few\nwavelengths. You can produce standing water waves of a similar\nnature in a small basin if you dabble with your finger rather\nuniformly in its center, or else just give it a little push so that\nthe water surface undulates. In this situation we are not dealing\nwith uniform wave propagation; what catches the interest are the\nnormal frequencies of these standing waves.\nThe water waves in the\nbasin are an analogue of a wave phenomenon associated with\nelectrons, which occurs in a region just about the size of the atom.\nThe normal frequencies of the wave group washing around the atomic\nnucleus are universally found to be exactly equal to Bohr\u2019s atomic\n\"energy levels\" divided by Planck\u2019s constant h. Thus the ingenious\nyet somewhat artificial assumptions of Bohr\u2019s model of the atom, as\nwell as of the older quantum theory in general, are superseded by\nthe far more natural idea of de Broglie\u2019s wave phenomenon.\nphenomenon forms the \"body\" proper of the atom. It takes the place\nof the individual pointlike electrons which in Bohr\u2019s model are\nsupposed to swarm around the nucleus. Such pointlike single\nparticles are completely out of the question within the atom, and if\none still thinks of the nucleus itself in this way one does so quite\nconsciously for reasons of expediency.\nWhat seems to me particularly important about the discovery that\n\"energy levels\" are virtually nothing but the frequencies of normal\nmodes of vibration is that now one can do without the assumption of\nsudden transitions, or quantum jumps, since two or more normal modes\nmay very well be excited simultaneously. The discreteness of the\nnormal frequencies fully suffices\u2014so I believe\u2014to support the\nconsiderations from which Planck started and many similar and just\nas important ones\u2014I mean, in short, to support all of quantum\nThe theory of quantum jumps is becoming more and more unacceptable,\nat least to me personally, as the years go on. Its abandonment has,\nhowever, far-reaching consequences. It means that one must give up\nentirely the idea of the exchange of energy in well-defined quanta\nand replace it with the concept of resonance between vibrational\nfrequencies. Yet we have seen that because of the identity of mass\nand energy, we must consider the particles themselves as Planck\u2019s\nenergy quanta. This is at first frightening. For the substituted\ntheory implies that we can no longer consider the individual\nparticle as a well-defined permanent entity.\nThat it is, in fact, no such thing can be reasoned in other ways.\nFor one thing, there is Werner Heisenberg\u2019s famous uncertainty\nprinciple, according to which a particle cannot simultaneously have\na well-defined position and a sharply defined velocity. This\nuncertainty implies that we cannot be sure that the same particle\ncould ever be observed twice.\nAnother conclusive reason for not\nattributing identifiable sameness to individual particles is that we\nmust obliterate their individualities whenever we consider two or\nmore interacting particles of the same kind, e.g., the two electrons\nof a helium atom. Two situations which are distinguished only by the\ninterchange of the two electrons must be counted as one and the\nsame; if they are counted as two equal situations, nonsense obtains.\nThis circumstance holds for any kind of particle in arbitrary\nnumbers without exception.\nMost theoreticians will probably accept the foregoing reasoning and\nadmit that the individual particle is not a well-defined permanent\nentity of detectable identity or sameness. Nevertheless this\ninadmissible concept of the individual particle continues to play a\nlarge role in their ideas and discussions. Even deeper rooted is the\nbelief in \"quantum jumps,\" which is now surrounded with a highly\nabstruse terminology whose common-sense meaning is often difficult\nFor instance, an important word in the standing vocabulary\nof quantum theory is \"probability,\" referring to transition from one\nlevel to another. But, after all, one can speak of the probability\nof an event only assuming that, occasionally, it actually occurs. If\nit does occur, the transition must indeed be sudden, since\nintermediate stages are disclaimed. Moreover, if it takes time, it\nmight conceivably be interrupted halfway by an unforeseen\ndisturbance. This possibility leaves one completely at sea.\nThe wave v. corpuscle dilemma is supposed to be resolved by\nasserting that the wave field merely serves for the computation of\nthe probability of finding a particle of given properties at a given\nposition if one looks for it there. But once one deprives the waves\nof reality and assigns them only a kind of informative role, it\nbecomes very difficult to understand the phenomena of interference\nand diffraction on the basis of the combined action of discrete\nsingle particles. It certainly seems easier to explain particle\ntracks in terms of waves than to explain the wave phenomenon in\nterms of corpuscles.\n\"Real existence\" is, to be sure, an expression which has been\nvirtually chased to death by many philosophical hounds. Its simple,\nnaive meaning has almost become lost to us. Therefore I want to\nrecall something else. I spoke of a corpuscle\u2019s not being an\nindividual. Properly speaking, one never observes the same particle\na second time\u2014very much as Heraclitus says of the river. You cannot\nmark an electron, you cannot paint it red. Indeed, you must not even\nthink of it as marked; if you do, your \"counting\" will be false and\nyou will get wrong results at every step\u2014for the structure of line\nspectra, in thermodynamics and elsewhere. A wave, on the other hand,\ncan easily be imprinted with an individual structure by which it can\nbe recognized beyond doubt. Think of the beacon fires that guide\nships at sea.\nThe light shines according to a definite code; for\nexample: three seconds light, five seconds dark, one second light,\nanother pause of five seconds, and again light for three seconds\u2014the\nskipper knows that is San Sebastian. Or you talk by wireless\ntelephone with a friend across the Atlantic; as soon as he says,\n\"Hello there, Edward Meier speaking,\" you know that his voice has\nimprinted on the radio wave a structure which can be distinguished\nfrom any other.\nBut one does not have to go that far. If your wife\ncalls, \"Francis!\" from the garden, it is exactly the same thing,\nexcept that the structure is printed on sound waves and the trip is\nshorter (though it takes somewhat longer than the journey of radio\nwaves across the Atlantic). All our verbal communication is based on\nimprinted individual wave structures. And, according to the same\nprinciple, what a wealth of details is transmitted to us in rapid\nsuccession by the movie or the television picture!\nThis characteristic, the individuality of the wave phenomenon, has\nalready been found to a remarkable extent in the very much finer\nwaves of particles. One example must suffice. A limited volume of\ngas, say helium, can be thought of either as a collection of many\nhelium atoms or as a superposition of elementary wave trains of\nmatter waves. Both views lead to the same theoretical results as to\nthe behavior of the gas upon heating, compression, and so on.\nwhen you attempt to apply certain somewhat involved enumerations to\nthe gas, you must carry them out in different ways according to the\nmental picture with which you approach it. If you treat the gas as\nconsisting of particles, then no individuality must be ascribed to\nthem, as I said. If, however, you concentrate on the matter wave\ntrains instead of on the particles, every one of the wave trains has\na well-defined structure which is different from that of any other.\nIt is true that there are many pairs of waves which are so similar\nto each other that they could change roles without any noticeable\neffect on the gas. But if you should count the very many similar\nstates formed in this way as merely a single one, the result would\nbe quite wrong.\nIn spite of everything we cannot completely banish the concepts of\nquantum jump and individual corpuscle from the vocabulary of\nphysics. We still require them to describe many details of the\nstructure of matter. How can one ever determine the weight of a\ncarbon nucleus and of a hydrogen nucleus, each to the precision of\nseveral decimals, and detect that the former is somewhat lighter\nthan the 12 hydrogen nuclei combined in it, without accepting for\nthe time being the view that these particles are something quite\nconcrete and real?\nThis view is so much more convenient than the\nroundabout consideration of wave trains that we cannot do without\nit, just as the chemist does not discard his valence-bond formulas,\nalthough he fully realizes that they represent a drastic\nsimplification of a rather involved wave-mechanical situation.\nIf you finally ask me: \"Well, what are these corpuscles, really?\" I\nought to confess honestly that I am almost as little prepared to\nanswer that as to tell where Sancho Panza\u2019s second donkey came from.\nAt the most, it may be permissible to say that one can think of\nparticles as more or less temporary entities within the wave field\nwhose form and general behavior are nevertheless so clearly and\nsharply determined by the laws of waves that many processes take\nplace as if these temporary entities were substantial permanent\nbeings. The mass and the charge of particles, defined with such\nprecision, must then be counted among the structural elements\ndetermined by the wave laws.\nThe conservation of charge and mass in\nthe large must be considered as a statistical effect, based on the\n\"law of large numbers.\"\nSimultaneously with the development of wave mechanics, Heisenberg\nevolved a different mathematical analysis known as matrix mechanics.\nAccording to Heisenberg\u2019s theory, which was developed in\ncollaboration with the German physicists Max Born and Ernst Pascual\nJordan, the formula was not a differential equation but a matrix: an\narray consisting of an infinite number of rows, each row consisting\nof an infinite number of quantities.\nMatrix mechanics introduced\ninfinite matrices to represent the position and momentum of an\nelectron inside an atom. Also, different matrices exist, one for\neach observable physical property associated with the motion of an\nelectron, such as energy, position, momentum, and angular momentum.\nThese matrices, like Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s differential equations, could be\nsolved; in other words, they could be manipulated to produce\npredictions as to the frequencies of the lines in the hydrogen\nspectrum and other observable quantities.\nLike wave mechanics,\nmatrix mechanics was in agreement with the earlier quantum theory\nfor processes in which the earlier quantum theory agreed with\nexperiment; it was also useful in explaining phenomena that earlier\nquantum theory could not explain.\nSchr\u00f6dinger subsequently succeeded in showing that wave mechanics\nand matrix mechanics are different mathematical versions of the same\ntheory, now called quantum mechanics. Even for the simple hydrogen\natom, which consists of two particles, both mathematical\ninterpretations are extremely complex. The next simplest atom,\nhelium, has three particles, and even in the relatively simple\nmathematics of classical dynamics, the three-body problem (that of\ndescribing the mutual interactions of three separate bodies) is not\nThe energy levels can be calculated accurately,\nhowever, even if not exactly. In applying quantum-mechanics\nmathematics to relatively complex situations, a physicist can use\none of a number of mathematical formulations. The choice depends on\nthe convenience of the formulation for obtaining suitable\nAlthough quantum mechanics describes the atom purely in terms of\nmathematical interpretations of observed phenomena, a rough verbal\ndescription can be given of what the atom is now thought to be like.\nSurrounding the nucleus is a series of stationary waves; these waves\nhave crests at certain points, each complete standing wave\nrepresenting an orbit. The absolute square of the amplitude of the\nwave at any point is a measure of the probability that an electron\nwill be found at that point at any given time.\nThus, an electron can\nno longer be said to be at any precise point at any given time.\nThe impossibility of pinpointing an electron at any precise time was\nanalyzed by Heisenberg, who in 1927 formulated the uncertainty\nprinciple. This principle states the impossibility of simultaneously\nspecifying the precise position and momentum of any particle. In\nother words, the more accurately a particle\u2019s momentum is measured\nand known, the less accuracy there can be in the measurement and\nknowledge of its position.\nThis principle is also fundamental to the\nunderstanding of quantum mechanics as it is generally accepted\ntoday: The wave and particle character of electromagnetic radiation\ncan be understood as two complementary properties of radiation.\nAnother way of expressing the uncertainty principle is that the\nwavelength of a quantum mechanical principle is inversely\nproportional to its momentum. As atoms are cooled they slow down and\ntheir corresponding wavelength grows larger.\nAt a low enough\ntemperature this wavelength is predicted to exceed the spacing\nbetween particles, causing atoms to overlap, becoming\nindistinguishable, and melding into a single quantum state. In 1995\na team of Colorado scientists, led by National Institutes of\nStandards and Technology physicist Eric Cornell and University of\nColorado physicist Carl Weiman, cooled rubidium atoms to a\ntemperature so low that the particles entered this merged state,\nknown as a Bose-Einstein condensate.\nThe condensate essentially\nbehaves like one atom even though it is made up of thousands.\n- Physicists Condense Supercooled Atoms, Forming New State of Matter\nA team of Colorado physicists has cooled atoms of gas to a\ntemperature so low that the particles entered a merged state, known\nas a \"Bose-Einstein condensate.\" This phenomenon was first predicted\nabout 70 years ago by the theories of German-born American physicist\nAlbert Einstein and Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose. The\ncondensed particles are considered a new state of matter, different\nfrom the common states of matter\u2014gas, liquid, and solid\u2014and from\nplasma, a high temperature, ionized form of matter that is found in\nthe sun and other stars.\nPhysicists have great expectations for the application of this\ndiscovery. Because the condensate essentially behaves like one atom\neven though it is made up of thousands, investigators should be able\nto measure interactions at the atomic and subatomic level that were\npreviously extremely difficult, if not impossible, to study\nThe condensate was detected June 5 by a Colorado team led by\nNational Institutes of Standards and Technology physicist Eric\nCornell and University of Colorado physicist Carl Wieman. Their\ndiscovery was reported in the journal Science on July 14. Cornell\nand Wieman formed their condensate from rubidium gas.\nSeveral groups of physicists, including the teams in Texas and\nColorado and a group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,\nhave been working to form pure condensate in recent years. The goal\nof the investigations has been to create a pure chunk of condensate\nout of atoms in an inert medium, such as a diffuse, nonreactive gas.\nThe effort began when methods of cooling and trapping became refined\nenough that it seemed possible to reach the required conditions of\ntemperature and density.\nThe Colorado team used two techniques: first laser cooling and then\nevaporative cooling. The laser technique used laser light whose\nfrequency was carefully tuned to interact with the rubidium atoms\nand gently reduce their speeds. A number of lasers were aimed at the\ngas to slow the motion of the atoms in different directions.\nThe Colorado physicists then switched to evaporative cooling. In\nthis method, the gas is \"trapped\" by a magnetic field that dwindles\nto zero at its center. Atoms that are moving wander out of the\nfield, while the coldest atoms cluster at the center. Because a few\nvery cold atoms could still escape at the zero field point of the\ntrap, the physicists perfected their system by adding a second\nslowly circling magnetic field so that the zero point moved, not\ngiving the atoms the chance to escape through it.\nPhysicists will now begin to explore the properties of the\ncondensate and see what other materials they can use to form it. One\nunusual characteristic of the condensate is that it is composed of\natoms that have lost their individual identities. This is analogous\nto laser light, which is composed of light particles, or photons,\nthat similarly have become indistinguishable and all behave in\nexactly the same manner. The laser has found a myriad of uses both\nin practical applications and in theoretical research, and the\nBose-Einstein condensate may turn out to be just as important. Some\nscientists speculate that if a condensate can be readily produced\nand sustained, it could be used to miniaturize and speed up computer\ncomponents to a scale and quickness not possible before.\nThe prediction that a merged form of matter will emerge at extremely\nlow temperatures is based on a number of aspects of the quantum\ntheory. This theory governs the interaction of particles on a\nsubatomic scale. The basic principle of quantum theory is that\nparticles can only exist in certain discrete energy states.\nThe exact \"quantum state\" of a particle takes into consideration\nsuch factors as the position of the particle and its \"spin,\" which\ncan only have certain discrete values. A particle\u2019s spin categorizes\nit as either a boson or a fermion. Those two groups of particles\nbehave according to different sets of statistical rules. Bosons have\nspins that are a constant number multiplied by an integer (e.g., 0,\n1, 2, 3). Fermions have spins that are that same constant multiplied\nby an odd half-integer (1\/2, 3\/2, 5\/2, etc.). Examples of fermions\nare the protons and neutrons that make up an atom\u2019s nucleus, and\nComposite particles, such as nuclei and atoms, are classified as\nbosons or fermions based on the sum of the spins of their\nconstituent particles. For instance, an isotope of helium called\nhelium-4 turns out to be a bose particle. Helium-4 is made up of six\nfermi particles: two electrons orbiting a nucleus made up of two\nprotons and two neutrons. Adding up six odd half-integers will yield\na whole integer, making helium-4 a boson. The atoms of rubidium used\nin the Colorado experiment are bose particles as well. Only bose\natoms may form a condensate, but they do so only at a sufficiently\nlow temperature and high density.\nAt their lab in Colorado, Cornell and Wieman cooled a rubidium gas\ndown to a temperature as close to absolute zero, the temperature at\nwhich particles stop moving, as they could get. The slower the\nparticles, the lower their momentum. In essence, the cooling brought\nthe momentum of the gas particles closer and closer to precisely\nzero, as the temperature decreased to within a few billionths of a\ndegree Kelvin. (Kelvin degrees are on the scale of degrees Celsius,\nbut zero Kelvin is absolute zero, while zero Celsius is the freezing\npoint of water.)\nAs the temperature, and thus the momentum, of the gas particles\ndropped to an infinitesimal amount, the possible locations of the\natom at any given moment increased proportionally. The goal of the\nexperiment was to keep the gas atoms packed together closely enough\nthat during this process\u2014as their momentum got lower and lower, and\ntheir wavelengths got larger and larger\u2014their waves would begin to\noverlap. This interplay of position and movement in three dimensions\nwith the relative distances between particles is known as the\nphase-space density and is the key factor in forming a condensate.\nIn essence, the momentum of the atoms would become so precisely\npinpointed (near zero) that their position would become less and\nless certain and there would be a relatively large amount of space\nthat would define each atom\u2019s position. As the atoms slowed to\nalmost a stop, their positions became so fuzzy that each atom came\nto occupy the same position as every other atom, losing their\nindividual identity. This odd phenomenon is a Bose-Einstein\nAs their experimental conditions neared the realm of Bose-Einstein\ncondensation, Cornell and Wieman noticed an abrupt rise in the peak\ndensity of their sample, a type of discontinuity that strongly\nindicates a phase transition. The Colorado physicists estimated that\nafter progressive evaporative cooling of the rubidium, they were\nleft with a nugget of about 2,000 atoms of pure condensate.\nand Wieman then released the atoms from the \"trap\" in which they had\nbeen cooling and sent a pulse of laser light at the condensate,\nbasically blowing it apart. They recorded an image of the expanding\ncloud of atoms. Prior to the light pulse, when the density dropped\nafter the atoms were released, the physicists believed the\ntemperature of the condensate fell to an amazing frigidity of 20\nnanoKelvins (20 billionths of one degree above absolute zero).\nThe image showed a larger, expanding sphere of particles with a\nsmaller, more concentrated elliptical-looking center. Cornell and\nWieman observed that when a gas is constrained and then released (in\nan extreme example, as in a bomb), thermodynamics specifies that it\nwill expand outward equally in all directions regardless of the\nshape in which it had been contained. This occurs because the\nparticles in that gas, even if the gas was very cold, were moving in\nall different directions with various energies when the gas was\nThis rule of uniform expansion does not hold for a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate. Because the particles were all acting in exactly the\nsame manner at the time of the light pulse, their expansion should\ngive some indication of the shape of the space they had previously\ninhabited. The uneven, elliptical-looking clump of atoms in the\ncenter of the image recorded by Cornell and Wieman thus gave further\nproof that a condensate had formed.\nBose-Einstein characteristics have been observed in other systems,\nspecifically, in superfluid liquid helium-4 and in superconductors.\nIt is believed that liquid helium-4 at a sufficiently low\ntemperature is composed of two components mixed together, the colder\nof which is a Bose-Einstein condensate. Liquid helium-4, which at\nvery low temperatures is also a superconductor of heat, behaves in\ndramatic ways, trickling up the sides of containers and rising in\nElectrical superconductors are also boson-related phenomena. In\nsuperconductors, which are also formed by supercooling, electrical\nresistance disappears. In this case it is the electrons within a\nsubstance\u2019s atoms, rather than the atoms themselves, that condense.\nThe electrons pair up, together forming a particle of zero spin.\nThese paired electrons merge into an overall substance that flows\nfreely through the superconductor, offering no resistance to\nThus, once initiated, a current can flow\nindefinitely in a superconductor.\nQuantum mechanics solved all of the great difficulties that troubled\nphysicists in the early years of the 20th century. It gradually\nenhanced the understanding of the structure of matter, and it\nprovided a theoretical basis for the understanding of atomic\nstructure (see Atom and Atomic Theory) and the phenomenon of\nspectral lines: Each spectral line corresponds to the energy of a\nphoton transmitted or absorbed when an electron makes a transition\nfrom one energy level to another.\nThe understanding of chemical\nbonding was fundamentally transformed by quantum mechanics and came\nto be based on Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s wave equations. New fields in physics\nemerged\u2014condensed matter physics, superconductivity, nuclear\nphysics, and elementary particle physics (see Physics)\u2014that all\nfound a consistent basis in quantum mechanics.\nFURTHER DEVELOPMENTS: In the years since 1925, no fundamental\ndeficiencies have been found in quantum mechanics, although the\nquestion of whether the theory should be accepted as complete has\ncome under discussion. In the 1930s the application of quantum\nmechanics and special relativity to the theory of the electron (see\nQuantum Electrodynamics) allowed the British physicist Paul Dirac to\nformulate an equation that referred to the existence of the spin of\nthe electron. It further led to the prediction of the existence of\nthe positron, which was experimentally verified by the American\nphysicist Carl David Anderson.\nThe application of quantum mechanics to the subject of\nelectromagnetic radiation led to explanations of many phenomena,\nsuch as bremsstrahlung (German, \"braking radiation,\" the radiation\nemitted by electrons slowed down in matter) and pair production (the\nformation of a positron and an electron when electromagnetic energy\ninteracts with matter). It also led to a grave problem, however,\ncalled the divergence difficulty: Certain parameters, such as the\nso-called bare mass and bare charge of electrons, appear to be\ninfinite in Dirac\u2019s equations.\n(The terms bare mass and bare charge\nrefer to hypothetical electrons that do not interact with any matter\nor radiation; in reality, electrons interact with their own electric\nThis difficulty was partly resolved in 1947-49 in a program\ncalled renormalization, developed by the Japanese physicist\nShin\u2019ichir\u00f4 Tomonaga, the American physicists Julian S. Schwinger\nand Richard Feynman, and the British physicist Freeman Dyson. In\nthis program, the bare mass and charge of the electron are chosen to\nbe infinite in such a way that other infinite physical quantities\nare canceled out in the equations.\nRenormalization greatly increased\nthe accuracy with which the structure of atoms could be calculated\nfrom first principles.\nTheoretical physicist C. Llewellyn Smith discusses the discoveries\nthat scientists have made to date about the electron and other\nelementary particles\u2014subatomic particles that scientists believe\ncannot be split into smaller units of matter. Scientists have\ndiscovered what Smith refers to as sibling and cousin particles to\nthe electron, but much about the nature of these particles is still\nOne way scientists learn about these particles is to\naccelerate them to high energies, smash them together, and then\nstudy what happens when they collide. By observing the behavior of\nthese particles, scientists hope to learn more about the fundamental\nstructures of the universe.\nElectrons: The First Hundred Years\nThe discovery of the electron was announced by J. J. Thomson just\nover 100 years ago, on April 30, 1897. In the intervening years we\nhave come to understand the mechanics that describe the behavior of\nelectrons\u2014and indeed of all matter on a small scale\u2014which is called\nquantum mechanics. By exploiting this knowledge, we have learned to\nmanipulate electrons and make devices of a tremendous practical and\neconomic importance, such as transistors and lasers.\nMeanwhile, what have we learned of the nature of the electron\nitself? From the start, electrons were found to behave as elementary\nparticles, and this is still the case today. We know that if the\nelectron has any structure, it is on a scale of less than 1018 m,\ni.e. less than 1 billionth of 1 billionth of a meter.\nHowever, a major complication has emerged. We have discovered that\nthe electron has a sibling and cousins that are apparently equally\nfundamental. The sibling is an electrically neutral particle, called\nthe neutrino, which is much lighter than the electron. The cousins\nare two electrically charged particles, called the mu and the\nwhich also have neutral siblings. The mu and the tau seem to be\nidentical copies of the electron, except that they are respectively\n200 and 3,500 times heavier. Their role in the scheme of things and\nthe origin of their different masses remain mysteries \u2014 just the sort\nof mysteries that particle physicists, who study the constituents of\nmatter and the forces that control their behavior, wish to resolve.\nWe therefore know of six seemingly fundamental particles, the\nelectron, the mu, the tau and their neutral siblings, which\u2014like the\nelectron\u2014do not feel the nuclear force, and incidentally are known\ngenerically as leptons.\nWhat about the constituents of atomic nuclei, which of course do\nfeel the nuclear force? At first sight, nuclei are made of protons\nand neutrons, but these particles turned out not to be elementary.\nIt was found that when protons and neutrons are smashed together,\nnew particles are created. We now know that all these particles are\nmade of more elementary entities, called quarks. In a collision,\npairs of quarks and their antiparticles, called antiquarks, can be\ncreated: part of the energy (e) of the incoming particles is turned\ninto mass (m) of these new particles, thanks to the famous\nequivalence e = mc2. The quarks in the projectiles and the created\nquark-antiquark pairs can then rearrange themselves to make various\ndifferent sorts of new particles.\nToday, six types of quarks are known which, like the leptons (the\nelectron and its relations) have simple properties, and could be\nelementary. In the past 30 years a recipe that describes the\nbehavior of these particles has been developed. It is called the\n\"Standard Model\" of particle physics. However, we lack a real\nunderstanding of the nature of these particles, and the logic behind\nthe Standard Model. What is wrong with the Standard Model?\nFirst, it does not consistently combine Einstein\u2019s theory of the\nproperties of space (called General Relativity) with a quantum\nmechanical description of the properties of matter. It is therefore\nSecond, it contains too many apparently arbitrary futures\u2014it is too\nbaroque, too byzantine\u2014to be complete. It does not explain the role\nof the mu and the tau, or answer the question whether the fact that\nthe numbers of leptons and quarks are the same\u2014six each\u2014is a\ncoincidence, or an indication of a deep connection between these\ndifferent types of particles. On paper, we can construct theories\nthat give better answers and explanations, and in which there are\nsuch connections, but we do not know which, if any, of these\ntheories is correct.\nThird, it has a missing, untested, element. This is not some minor\ndetail, but a central element, namely a mechanism to generate the\nobserved masses of the known particles, and hence also the different\nranges of the known forces (long range for gravity and\nelectromagnetism, as users of magnetic compasses know, but very\nshort range for the nuclear and the so-called weak forces, although\nin every other respect these forces appear very similar). On paper,\na possible mechanism is known, called the Higgs mechanism, after the\nBritish physicist Peter Higgs who invented it. But there are\nalternative mechanisms, and in any case the Higgs mechanism is a\ngeneric idea. We not only need to know if nature uses it, but if so,\nhow it is realized in detail.\nLuckily the prospects of developing a deeper understanding are good.\nThe way forward is to perform experiments that can distinguish the\ndifferent possibilities. We know that the answer to the mystery of\nthe origin of mass, and the different ranges of forces, and certain\nother very important questions, must lie in an energy range that\nwill be explored in experiments at the Large Hadron Collider, a new\naccelerator now under construction at CERN [also known as the\nEuropean Laboratory for Particle Physics] near Geneva.\nThe fundamental tools on which experimental particle physics depends\nare large accelerators, like the Large Hadron Collider, which\naccelerate particles to very high energies and smash them together.\nBy studying what happens in the collisions of these particles, which\nare typically electrons or protons (the nuclei of hydrogen atoms),\nwe can learn about their natures. The conditions that are created in\nthese collisions of particles existed just after the birth of the\nuniverse, when it was extremely hot and dense. Knowledge derived\nfrom experiments in particle physics is therefore essential input\nfor those who wish to understand the structure of the universe as a\nwhole, and how it evolved from an initial fireball into its present\nThe Large Hadron Collider will therefore not only open up a large\nnew window on the nature of matter, when it comes into operation in\n2005, but also advance our understanding of the structure of the\nuniverse. However, although it will undoubtedly resolve some major\nquestions and greatly improve our knowledge of nature, it would be\nvery surprising if it established a \"final theory.\"\nThe only candidate theory currently known which appears to have the\npotential to resolve all the problems mentioned above\u2014the reason for\nthe existence of the mu and tau, reconciliation of\ngeneral relativity with quantum mechanics, etc.\u2014describes the\nelectron and its relatives and the quarks, not as pointlike objects,\nbut as different vibrating modes of tiny strings. However, these\nstrings are so small (10-35 m) that they will never be observed\nIf this is so, the electron and the other known particles\nwill continue forever to appear to be fundamental pointlike objects,\neven if the\u2014currently very speculative\u2014\"string theory\" scores enough\nsuccesses to convince us that this is not the case!\nFUTURE PROSPECTS: Quantum mechanics underlies current attempts to\naccount for the strong nuclear force and to develop a unified theory for all the fundamental interactions\nNevertheless, doubts exist about the completeness of quantum theory.\nThe divergence difficulty, for example, is only partly resolved.\nJust as Newtonian mechanics was eventually amended by quantum\nmechanics and relativity, many scientists\u2014and Einstein was among\nthem\u2014are convinced that quantum theory will also undergo profound\nchanges in the future.\nGreat theoretical difficulties exist, for\nexample, between quantum mechanics and chaos theory, which began to\ndevelop rapidly in the 1980s.\nOngoing efforts are being made by\ntheorists such as the British physicist Stephen Hawking, to develop\na system that encompasses both relativity and quantum mechanics.\nBreakthroughs occurred in the area of quantum computing in the late\n1990s. Quantum computers under development use components of a\nchloroform molecule (a combination of chlorine and hydrogen atoms)\nand a variation of a medical procedure called magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) to compute at a molecular level. Scientists used a\nbranch of physics called quantum mechanics, which describes the\nactivity of subatomic particles (particles that make up atoms), as\nthe basis for quantum computing.\nQuantum computers may one day be\nthousands to millions of times faster than current computers,\nbecause they take advantage of the laws that govern the behavior of\nsubatomic particles. These laws allow quantum computers to examine\nall possible answers to a query at one time.\nFuture uses of quantum\ncomputers could include code breaking and large database queries.\nQuantum Time Waits for No Cosmos\nTHE INTRIGUING notion that time might run backwards when the\nUniverse collapses has run into difficulties. Raymond Laflamme, of\nthe Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, has carried out a\nnew calculation which suggests that the Universe cannot start out\nuniform, go through a cycle of expansion and collapse, and end up in\na uniform state. It could start out disordered, expand, and then\ncollapse back into disorder. But, since the COBE data show that our\nUniverse was born in a smooth and uniform state, this symmetric\npossibility cannot be applied to the real Universe.\nPhysicists have long puzzled over the fact that two distinct \"arrows\nof time\" both point in the same direction. In the everyday world,\nthings wear out -- cups fall from tables and break, but broken cups\nnever re- assemble themselves spontaneously. In the expanding\nUniverse at large, the future is the direction of time in which\ngalaxies are further apart.\nMany years ago, Thomas Gold suggested that these two arrows might be\nlinked. That would mean that if and when the expansion of the\nUniverse were to reverse, then the everyday arrow of time would also\nreverse, with broken cups re-assembling themselves.\nMore recently, these ideas have been extended into quantum physics.\nThere, the arrow of time is linked to the so-called \"collapse of the\nwave function\", which happens, for example, when an electron wave\nmoving through a TV tube collapses into a point particle on the\nscreen of the TV. Some researchers have tried to make the quantum\ndescription of reality symmetric in time, by including both the\noriginal state of the system (the TV tube before the electron passes\nthrough) and the final state (the TV tube after the electron has\npassed through) in one mathematical description.\nMurray Gell-Mann and James Hartle recently extended this idea to the\nwhole Universe. They argued that if, as many cosmologists believe\nlikely, the Universe was born in a Big Bang, will expand out for a\nfinite time and then recollapse into a Big Crunch, the time-neutral\nquantum theory could describe time running backwards in the\ncontracting half of its life.\nUnfortunately, Laflamme has now shown that this will not work. He\nhas proved that if there are only small inhomogeneities present in\nthe Big Bang, then they must get larger throughout the lifetime of\nthe Universe, in both the expanding and the contracting phases. \"A\nlow entropy Universe at the Big Bang cannot come back to low entropy\nat the Big Crunch\" (Classical and Quantum Gravity, vol 10 p L79). He\nhas found time-asymmetric solutions to the equations -- but only if\nboth Big Bang and Big Crunch are highly disordered, with the\nUniverse more ordered in the middle of its life.\nObservations of the cosmic microwave background radiation show that\nthe Universe emerged from the Big Bang in a very smooth and uniform\nstate. This rules out the time-symmetric solutions.\nis that even if the present expansion of the Universe does reverse,\ntime will not run backwards and broken cups will not start re-","id":"<urn:uuid:44c88cfb-a6f6-4068-86e0-5247fe04dc45>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.bibliotecapleyades.net\/ciencia\/time_travel\/esp_ciencia_timetravel03.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9347438216,"token_count":13287,"score":3.796875,"int_score":4}
{"text":"We look at five technologies that look set to become part of every day lives very soon, to find out how they'll change our lives.\nThis technology could be a game-changer for device connectivity. A modern desktop computer today may include jacks to accommodate ethernet, USB 2.0, FireWire 400 or 800 (IEEE 1394a or 1394b) or both, DVI or DisplayPort or both, and - on some -eSATA.\nUSB 3.0 could eliminate all of these except ethernet. In their place, a computer may have several USB 3.0 ports, delivering data to monitors, retrieving it from scanners, and exchanging it with hard drives. The improved speed comes at a good time, as much-faster flash memory drives are in the pipeline.\nUSB 3.0 is fast enough to allow uncompressed 1080p video (currently our highest-definition video format) at 60 frames per second, says Jeff Ravencraft, president and chair of the USB-IF.\nThat would enable a camcorder to forgo video compression hardware and patent licensing fees for MPEG-4. The user could either stream video live from a simple camcorder (with no video processing required) or store it on an internal drive for later rapid transfer; neither of these methods is feasible today without heavy compression.\nCiting 3.0's versatility, some analysts see the standard as a possible complement - or even alternative - to the consumer HDMI connection found on today's Blu-ray players.\nThe new USB flavor could also turn computers into real charging stations. Whereas USB 2.0 can produce 100 milliamperes (mA) of trickle charge for each port, USB 3.0 ups that quantity to 150mA per device. USB 2.0 tops out at 500mA for a hub; the maximum for USB 3.0 is 900mA.\nWith mobile phones moving to support USB as the standard plug for charging and syncing, the increased amperage of USB 3.0 might let you do away with wall warts (AC adapters) of all kinds.\nIn light of the increased importance and use of USB in its 3.0 version, future desktop computers may very well have two internal hubs, with several ports easily accessible in the front to act as a charging station.\nEach hub could have up to six ports and support the full amperage. Meanwhile, laptop machines could multiply USB ports for better charging and access on the road.\n(Apple's Mac Mini already includes five USB 2.0 ports on its back.)\nThe higher speed of 3.0 will accelerate data transfers, of course, moving more than 20GB of data per minute. This will make performing backups (and maintaining offsite backups) of increasingly large collections of images, movies, and downloaded media a much easier job.\nPossible new applications for the technology include on-the-fly syncs and downloads (as described in the case study above).\nThe USB-IF's Ravencraft notes that customers could download movies at the gas pump at of a filling station.\n\"With high-speed USB [2.0], you couldn't have people waiting in line at 15 minutes a crack to download a movie,\" Ravencraft says.\nManufacturers are poised to take advantage of USB 3.0, and analysts predict mass adoption of the standard on computers within a couple of years.\nThe format will be popular in mobile devices and consumer electronics, as well. Ravencraft says that manufacturers currently sell more than 2 billion devices with built-in USB each year, so there's plenty of potential for getting the new standard out fast.\nNEXT PAGE: Video streaming over Wi-Fi","id":"<urn:uuid:1d4a0e98-f22e-4d89-9859-8f510bcc8419>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.pcadvisor.co.uk\/news\/gadget\/3205097\/five-technologies-that-will-change-the-face-of-it\/?pn=2","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9384644032,"token_count":757,"score":2.703125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Groundhogs, as a species, have a large range in size. There are the medium-sized rodents I grew up with, averaging around 4 kg, and groundhogs\u2014like a certain Phil\u2014that are probably more like 14 kg. This is the likely source of my earlier confusion, as that's a huge discrepancy in size. Evidently, it's all in the diet, much like humans.\nWhere I grew up, in rural Northern Minnesota, we called the groundhog a woodchuck; I thought that the groundhog was some fat cat, East Coast, liberal rodent. As it would turn out, they are actually one in the same creature\u2014Marmota monax, a member of the squirrel family. Woodchucks spend a lot of their time in burrows. It is their safe haven from their many predators, and they are quick to flee to it at the first sign of danger. They will sometimes emit a loud whistle on their way to alert others in the area that something is awry. Groundhogs enjoy raiding our gardens and digging up sod, thereby destroying what we've spent countless hours toiling upon.\nLook for groundhog signs. You might not even know there is a groundhog around until your garden has been devoured or your tractor damaged by a collapsed groundhog den. Things to look for are large nibble marks on your prized veggies, gnaw marks on the bark of young fruit trees, root vegetables pulled up (or their tops trimmed off), groundhog-sized holes (25\u201330 cm) anywhere near your garden, or mounds of dirt near said holes. If you see these signs, take action. Don't wait or it will be too late! If you know it will be a problem and do nothing, you can't blame the animal.\nSet groundhog traps. This technique takes some skill as you need to be able to pick a spot in the path of the animal, camouflage it, and mask your strong human scent. Setting a spring trap, whether coil or long-spring, is usually just a matter of compressing the springs and setting a pin that keeps the jaws open into the pan or trigger. Make sure your trap is anchored securely with a stake. Check your traps often, and dispatch the animal quickly and humanely. Shooting them in the head or a hearty whack to the head with club will do the trick. If you can't deal with this, you have no business setting traps. Call a professional.\nGuns kill groundhogs. I have never shot a groundhog. I rarely have had problems with them, and they move so damned fast it is difficult to get a shot off. If I had to, I know how I would do it. First, be sure it is legal in your area, and be sure to follow gun safety protocols. After that, it's just a matter of learning where your target is going to be comfortable and let their guard down. I would follow their tracks back to their den, find a spot downwind to sit with a clear shooting lane, and make sure nothing you shouldn't hit with a bullet is down range. Then, I would wait, my sights set on the den, until the groundhog stuck its head up\u2014quick and easy.\nDemolish the groundhog burrows. If you find a couple holes around your yard, they are likely the entrances to an elaborate tunnel maze carved into the earth beneath you. About all you can do, short of digging the whole mess up, is to try and fill it in from the top side. First, fill it with a bunch of rocks and then soil\u2014make sure to really pack it in. This will make it difficult for the groundhog to reclaim its hole without a lot of work. You probably want to do this in tandem with other control methods such as trapping, shooting, or fumigating to prevent the groundhog from just digging a new hole.\nDo some landscaping and build barriers. As with the control of many pests, it is advisable to keep a yard free of brush, undercover, and dead trees. These types of features are attractive to groundhogs as cover, and without it, they are less likely to want to spend time there. If you want to keep a groundhog out of an area, consider a partially buried fence. This will require a lot of work, but it is going to help a lot. Make sure it extends up at least a meter, and that it is buried somewhere around 30 cm deep. Angle the fencing outward 90 degrees when you bury it, and it will make digging under it a very daunting task for your furry friend.\nTry using fumigants to kill groundhogs. What is nice about this product is that you can kill the animal and bury it all in one stroke. The best time to do this is in the spring when the mother will be in the den with her still helpless young. Also, the soil will likely be damp, which helps a lot. You should definitely follow the directions on the package, but the way they usually work is that you cover all but one exit, set off the smoke bomb, shove it down the hole, and quickly cover it up. Check back in a day or two to see if there is any sign of activity, and if so, do it again or consider a different control method. It is important that you don't do this if the hole is next to your house or if there is any risk of a fire.\nPoisons are a last resort. I am not a fan of poisons because it is difficult to target what will eat said poison in the wild. Also, you are left with the issue of where the groundhog will die and how bad it will smell if it is somewhere under your house. Or, if it is outside somewhere, who will be affected by eating the dead animal? Where does it end? If you want to use poison, you're on your own.\nUse live traps. This is a good option for those of you not too keen on killing things. Try jamming the door open and leaving bait inside for the taking a couple of times so they get used to it. Then, set it normally and you've got your groundhog (or a neighborhood cat). Now what? The relocation is just as important; you need to choose a place that is far away from other humans and can likely support a groundhog. Good luck.\nPredator urine. The idea is simple: form a perimeter around an area you want to protect. If the groundhog doesn't recognize the smell as a natural predator, it is probably not going to work too well. Look for brands that have wolf and bobcat urine. Apply regularly, or as the manufacturer recommends. Remember, if it rains, the urine has probably washed away.\nRepellents. Another popular method involves pepper-based repellents. These deter groundhogs by tasting horrible and burning their mucous membranes. You can do a perimeter with powdered cayenne pepper or just apply it to the things you want spared in your garden. Be sure to wash your vegetables off before using them (which you should be doing anyway).","id":"<urn:uuid:077623b0-183e-4d40-bf5d-168228829785>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/simplepestcontrol.com\/groundhog-control.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9678292274,"token_count":1467,"score":3.03125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"The American Revolutionary War began in 1775 and ended in 1783. The British ruled the American colonists and they had become increasingly rebellious. General Gage had ordered 700 British soldiers to Concord to destroy a weapon's depot belonging to the colonists. On the way, they are met by some rebellious colonists and the British fire, killing eight Americans and wounding ten. This was known as \u2018the shot heard round the world' and the war was on. The first major battle occurred on June 17, 1775 at Boston, Massachusetts. It was known as the Battle of Bunker Hill. The British are used to marching proudly out before taking aim and firing. The Americans have been ordered not to fire until they can see the whites of their eyes. They are dug in along the high ground of Breed's Hill. As the British close in, the Americans begin firing halting the advance. The British regroup and attack again. The same thing happens. By the third attack the Americans are out of ammunition and have to resort to stones and bayonets. Although the British take the hill, they've lost half their force with over a thousand casualties; the Americans have lost four hundred. On January 9, 1776, Thomas Paine's pamphlet, \u2018Common Sense' criticizes King George III and encourages independence from Britain. It becomes a bestseller. By May, America has support from France and promises of support from Spain. After many battles, Congress formally endorses the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. But the war isn't over yet. On July 14, 1777, Congress mandates an American flag consisting of thirteen stars and thirteen stripes to represent the thirteen colonies.\nThe first major American victory in the Revolutionary war occurs on October 7, 1777 at the Battle of Saratoga. There are six hundred British casualties to one hundred fifty American. On November 15, 1777, Congress adopts the Articles of Confederation giving Congress the sole authority of the new government. In February, France officially recognizes the United States. On March 16, 1778, a Peace Commission from Britain is sent to negotiate with the Americans. They offer to meet all demands, except independence. Congress rejects their offer. On July 10, 1778, France declares war against Britain. By now the British have instigated attacks on Americans by the native Indians. On May 12, 1780, the Americans suffered a major defeat as Charleston, South Carolina was captured by the British. On October 17, 1781, the British at Yorktown send out a flag of truce. On January 1, 1782, the British begin leaving America. On February 27, 1782, the House of Commons in England votes against further war with America. On August 27, 1872, the last battle is waged in South Carolina.

{"text":"1 October 2009\nA picnic basket linked to Agatha Christie, soil samples collected before the Channel Tunnel was built and a radioactive rock used in a Nobel Prize-winning experiment feature in a provocative new exhibition at UCL.\nDisposal?, which opens on Monday 19 October 2009, invites you to comment on the most challenging question faced by museums today: What should we collect and hold on to and what should we get rid of?\nThe exhibition includes objects which would not normally be on display, such as a crusher which can apply the weight of 150 hippos, a collection of plastic dinosaurs and slides containing microscopic fossils.\nAmong these are five objects earmarked for disposal that the public can vote on. This is one of several ways in which people can contribute their views on the collections: on what they think is important, what should be collected and what they feel would be better off elsewhere.\nFeatured pieces will include:\n- A picnic basket belonging to Agatha Christie\u2019s husband\u2019s second wife Barbara Parker. The husband, Max Mallowan, was a famous archaeologist. Parker donated the hamper and its contents to UCL. The contents included Minoan pottery, a key, a doorknob, beads and a copy of The Times.\n- Soil samples collected before the building of the Channel Tunnel. Archaeologists take such samples to see if a site contains archaeological material. These samples were stored at UCL soon after they were taken, but have never been analysed.\n- A radioactive mineral sample which emits alpha particles, but which is historically important. William Ramsay (1852\u20131916), a former head of UCL Chemistry, used it to discover helium in one of a series of Nobel Prize-winning experiments.\nThe exhibition will also host two events:\n- \u2018Fight at the Museum: Rescue My Object!\u2019 on Tuesday 20 October, 6.30pm \u2013 9pm, will see experts battle to convince an audience to save their favourite object housed in different collections at UCL.\n- \u2018Treasured? Hunt\u2019 on Wednesday 28 October, 6pm \u2013 9pm, will invite people to seek out intriguing objects and specimens in store and decide for themselves just how treasured objects should be.\nDisposing of objects by museums is controversial, conjuring up emotive images of collections thrown into skips or valuable artworks lost to the nation through private sales. With ever-decreasing resources and ever-expanding collections, museums are under serious pressure. Collections are fast becoming unsustainable \u2013 ethical but tough decision-making is essential to museums\u2019 survival.\nIn a research-led university such as UCL, collections have to keep pace with cutting-edge innovations and new discoveries. While active collecting always goes on, responsible and regular disposal is essential for collections to stay manageable.\nSubhadra Das, UCL Collections Reviewer, says: \u201cUCL Museums & Collections hold thousands of fascinating and historically important objects which are used for teaching and research. Like all museums, they also contain objects whose roles and use are unclear or problematic. Some objects may no longer be useful, some are too big or have become damaged and some should never have been collected. In the past such things have sometimes been disposed of thoughtlessly \u2013 by putting them in the skip. This exhibition is about thoughtful disposal.\u201d\nThe exhibition runs from Monday 19 October to Saturday 31 October 2009, is open to the public and is free of charge.

{"text":"Diagnosing Mesothelioma: MRIs\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of several imaging techniques that doctors use to detect, stage and evaluate the progression of mesothelioma.\nThese non-invasive scans use magnets and radio waves to help doctors visualize a patient\u2019s organs, tissues, bones and tumors. Many radiologists consider MRIs ideal for viewing the anatomical structures of the chest and abdomen \u2013 including the pleura and peritoneum, where mesothelioma tumors most commonly develop.\nThe first commercial MRI units emerged in the 1980s. Since then, the technology has advanced considerably. Modern MRI units use superconductor magnets and coils to produce a constant magnetic field, as well as radiofrequency energy to measure signals from the nuclei of hydrogen atoms inside the body. Computers inside the scanner register these signals and turn them into images. Most modern units also include a shield, which prevents the scanner from picking up interference from outside signals sources like televisions and radio stations.\nMRIs work by aligning the water molecules in your body. Radio waves then cause these aligned particles to emit signals, which register on the scanner. The images reflect the amount of activity that is occurring in each internal structure. Each MRI-generated image shows a thin slice of the body.\nThe MRI Process\nThe entire MRI process takes about an hour or two to complete. The scan itself takes between 30 and 60 minutes, but the appointment also includes pre-scan positioning and other preparation activities.\nOnce patients arrive at the MRI center and fill out their paperwork, they must remove all metal objects from their bodies. The strong magnets in an MRI scanner can attract zippered clothing, jewelry, watches, belts, keys and credit cards. Implanted medical devices that contain metal may also cause complications with the scan. Next, patients will put on a hospital gown and ear plugs.\nFast FactSome MRI scans use a contrast dye to improve image detail. The most common dye is gadolinium, which is safe and effective for most patients with properly functioning kidneys. This magnetic metal ion can visually enhance lesions on MRI images, indicating growths that may be mesothelioma tumors.\nFor contrast-enhanced MRIs, patients will receive an injection of a contrast dye. This makes certain areas show up more clearly on the test. After the injection, patients lie down on the imaging table.\nThe technologist then arranges a coil around the part of the body that is being imaged. For pleural mesothelioma, this will be the chest. For peritoneal mesothelioma, it will be the abdomen. Once the technician positions the patient\u2019s body correctly for the exam, the patient and table are slid into a tube-like opening in the MRI machine.\nDuring the scan, the machine makes repetitive knocking sounds as the magnetic field gradients turn on and off. The test itself is painless. Patients should try not to move during the scan, but they can communicate with their technician via microphone if they feel scared or claustrophobic. Patients can leave the MRI center immediately after the scan.\nA post-processing technologist will then highlight abnormal areas on the images. Once the final images are ready for review, a radiologist interprets the results and provides the patient\u2019s primary doctor with a report. From there, the physician can examine the scan on a computer monitor, send them electronically to the rest of the treatment team or print them out for the patient\u2019s medical records.\nMRI Side Effects\nPatients occasionally experience minor side effects after an MRI scan.\n|Magnetophosphenes (brief flashes of light across the retina)||Vertigo\/Dizziness||Metallic taste in the mouth||Nausea||Physical burns or burning sensations (extremely rare)|\nMRIs do not place patients at risk for radiation-induced damage. Because MRIs do not use ionizing radiation, most doctors prefer MRIs for patients who need routine imaging scans. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concludes that as long as the field strengths are kept below 2.0 Tesla, MRIs are safe for repeated use.\nMRIs for Diagnosing Mesothelioma Tumors\nMagnetic resonance imaging currently plays a limited role in diagnosing mesothelioma. When doctors do prescribe MRI scans to diagnose the disease, they often use them to complement CT scan results. MRI-generated images can help differentiate between normal tissue and tumor tissue, which cannot be determined with a CT scan alone.\nMRI scans produce a visual representation of differences is signal intensity between cancerous and noncancerous tissues. Because cancerous tissues emit more intense signals than surrounding healthy tissue, malignant mesothelioma tissues appear as white spots on the scan results with varying brightness. The difference between malignant and noncancerous tissue is even more pronounced in contrast-enhanced MRIs.\nTo arrive at a mesothelioma diagnosis, radiologists usually inspect MRI-generated images for a mass on the pleura, which encases the lungs. These masses often emit signals of intermediate intensity. The fluid located between the lungs and pleura can also indicate mesothelioma, as areas of pleural fluid with very intense signals sometimes surround pleural masses. MRI scans are generally superior to CT scans for characterizing pleural fluid as benign or malignant.\n|Chest wall infiltration||Mediastinal pleural involvement||Circumferential pleural thickening||Nodularity||Other irregular changes in pleural tissue|\nFeatures such as bilateral pleural involvement, pleural shrinkage, pleural effusions and pleural calcifications may also show up on MRI-generated images. These features may suggest mesothelioma, but cannot be used to make a definitive diagnosis.\nMRIs for Staging Mesothelioma Tumors\nMost studies indicate that MRIs and CT scans are equally effective for accurately staging malignant mesothelioma tumors. While MRIs are less effective at detecting lymph node involvement, they are generally superior at detecting the extent of a tumor\u2019s invasion of other local structures \u2013 one of the key steps in staging a mesothelioma tumor.\nWhen radiologists use MRIs to stage a mesothelioma tumor, they look for the following features:\n- Loss of normal fat planes\n- Extension into mediastinal fat\n- Tumor growth that encases more than half the circumference of an organ or mediastinal structure\nRadiologists can exclude patients as good surgical candidates if an MRI scan shows mediastinal or full-thickness pericardial involvement, diffuse or multifocal chest wall disease or involvement of the diaphragm or spine.\nBy revealing the stage of a mesothelioma tumor, MRI images can help doctors determine whether or not the patient is a good candidate for invasive surgery. MRIs are especially useful for detecting two primary features of patients who are unlikely to benefit from an aggressive operation: chest wall invasion and involvement of the diaphragm.\nIn one study, MRIs detected diaphragmatic spread with 82 percent accuracy, while CT scans detected the same condition with only 55 percent accuracy.\nMRIs are useful for staging mesothelioma with the TNM system. Some studies suggest that MRI scans can differentiate between T3 and T4 disease, but not earlier stages like T1 and T2. One study found that MRIs understaged half of the mesothelioma tumors by failing to detect pericardial invasion, which advances tumors from stage T2 to stage T3. However, the same MRIs were effective at detecting involvement of the internal pericardium, which also advances tumors from stage T3 to T4. The study correctly identified all of the tumors that were stage T3 or lower (while excluding the T4 tumors) with a positive predictive value of 100 percent.\nMRIs for Evaluating Response to Treatment\nOncologists consider the MRI an accurate and reproducible technique for evaluating patient response to mesothelioma treatment. When evaluating the MRI scan results of mesothelioma patients undergoing treatment, radiologists often measure the tumor from several separate sites. This helps account for the rind-like growth pattern of the cancer. The primary measurement that the doctors look for is an increase or decrease in pleural thickness.\nFast FactIn one study of 50 mesothelioma patients, MRI scans correctly categorized the tumor response in 92 percent of patients.\nIf there is no visible disease on the post-treatment imaging scan, doctors call this complete response. If there is a 30 percent decrease in the sum of linear tumor measurements, they generally refer to that as a partial response to treatment. If the MRI indicates a size increase of at least 20 percent (or shows a newly developed lesion), the disease is considered progressive.\nDoctors may prescribe lung spirometry tests when using MRIs as another way to evaluate treatment response. Patients whose MRIs indicate a partial or complete response to mesothelioma treatment often display simultaneous improvements in lung function, which can be measured with a spirometer.\nWhen doctors study MRI results to determine treatment response, they can adjust their patient\u2019s prognosis accordingly. In one study, patients whose MRIs indicated a response to therapy had a median survival of 15.1 months, while patients whose MRIs indicated no response had a median survival of only 8.9 months.","id":"<urn:uuid:9fc430d6-9c49-4cea-bce9-78876d30ae99>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.asbestos.com\/treatment\/scans\/mri.php","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.914763689,"token_count":1962,"score":3.359375,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Efforts to incorporate Bowmanstown as a borough occurred as early as 1892. The village contained about 300 inhabitants in 1896 but the nearby New Jersey Zinc Company soon added to its growth. Bowmanstown was incorporated as a Borough on November 29, 1913 for the purpose of providing general local government services to residents of the community. Upon incorporation of Bowmanstown as a borough its boundaries encompassed lands measuring 0.75 square mile. The borough's assessed valuation in 1918 was $279,000.00. The population of 834 in 1920 remained relatively constant for decades. The Bowmanstown Borough Municipal Building (Borough Hall) is a converted school building that was constructed in 1903 to serve the youths of the community. In 1958, the Palmerton School District was established and combined several local schools in order to create a regional school thus making the Bowmanstown campus obsolete. In 1964, the Borough acquired the old brick school building and has been using it as offices ever since. The borough kept the building in its original condition.\nThe Bowmanstown Borough Authority was incorporated August 24, 1997 and was created for the purpose of owning and operating the Bowmanstown Public Water System. On February 11, 2002 the Authority began construction of its water system improvement project which included a new chlorine building, looping numerous water mains, installing new services, erection of a new 250,000 gallon Standpipe and a new liner to the one Reservoir.

{"text":"Hands on activityThe English designer William Morris was influenced by Indian patterns when he designed this block printed cotton fabric in 1883. Other British designers used Indian patterns, such as 'Paisley'. Using factories, British cloth makers were able to make cheaper fabrics and sell it in India in Victorian times. Indian weavers spun, wove and decorated their cloth in their own homes and this made it more expensive, so many of them went out of business. Have a look at the images below. They show some designs, cloth printing and the blocks used to print cloths.\nYou would need to print with your block thousands of time to decorate a large piece of cloth by hand.

{"text":"Battle of the Boyne\nThe Battle of the Boyne was a turning point in the Williamite war in Ireland, between the deposed King James VII of Scotland and II of England and his son-in-law and successor, William III (\"William of Orange\"), for the English, Scottish, and Irish thrones. It took place on July 1, 1690 (Old Style date), just outside of the town of Drogheda on Ireland's east coast. As a consequence of the adoption of the Gregorian calendar, the battle is now commemorated on July 12.\nThough not militarily decisive, its symbolic importance has made it one of the most infamous battles in British and Irish history and a key part in Irish Protestant folklore. It is still commemorated today, principally by the Orange Order. Irish Protestants have cast the battle as one between William the representative of Christ and the forces of darkness. Their victory meant that the Protestants had \"won\" Ireland, and it justified their ascendancy.\nKing William's victory was followed by systematic efforts to Protestantize Ireland with Protestant settlers and legal restrictions on the rights of Catholics. However, this was but a chapter in a continuing process of what was called the \"pacification\" of Ireland, beginning with Pope Adrian IV's bull that granted Ireland to England and Henry II's invasion of 1171. This process led to the establishment of a Protestant majority in the province of Ulster, most of which became Northern Ireland in 1921, and where conflict between Catholic and Protestants, known as the \"troubles,\" led to British military intervention in between 1969 and 1997.\nA sectarian battle\nThe battle of the Boyne was the decisive encounter in a war that was primarily about James's attempt to regain the thrones of England and Scotland, but is widely remembered as a decisive moment in the struggle between Protestant and Catholic factions in Ireland. However, recent analyses have played down the religious aspect of the conflict. In fact, both armies were religiously mixed, and William of Orange's own elite force\u2014the Dutch Blue Guards\u2014had the papal banner with them on the day, many of the Guardsmen being Dutch Catholics. They were part of the League of Augsburg, a cross-Christian alliance designed to stop a French conquest of Europe, supported by the Vatican. The war in Ireland was also the beginning of a long-running but ultimately unsuccessful campaign by James's supporters, the Jacobites, to restore the Stuart dynasty rule to the British thrones. While most Jacobites in Ireland were indeed Catholics, many English and Scottish Jacobites were Protestants and were motivated by loyalty to the principle of monarchy (considering James to have been illegally deposed in a coup) or to the Stuart dynasty in particular, rather than by religion. A handful of British Jacobites fought with James at the Boyne. In addition, some of the French regiments fighting with the Jacobites at the Boyne were composed of German Protestants. In a European context, therefore, the battle was not a religiously motivated one, but part of a complicated political, dynastic, and strategic conflict.\nIn an Irish context, however, the war was a sectarian and ethnic conflict, in many ways a re-run of the Irish Confederate Wars of 50 years earlier. For Irish Jacobites, the war was fought for Irish sovereignty, religious toleration for Catholicism, and land ownership. The Irish Catholic upper classes had lost almost all their lands after Cromwell's conquest and had also lost the right to hold public office, practice their religion, and to sit in the Irish Parliament. They saw the reign of the Catholic King James as a means of redressing these grievances and to secure the autonomy of Ireland from the English Parliament. To these ends, under Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell they had raised an army to restore James to his throne after the Glorious Revolution. By 1690, they controlled all of Ireland except for the Northern province of Ulster. Most of James II's troops at the Boyne were Irish Catholics.\nConversely, for Williamites in Ireland, the war was about maintaining Protestant and British rule in Ireland. The Irish Williamites were mainly Protestant settlers from England and Scotland who had come to the country during the Plantations of Ireland. They were a majority in the northern province of Ulster. They feared for both their lives and their property if James and his Catholic supporters were allowed to rule Ireland. In particular, they feared a repeat of the Irish Rebellion of 1641, when there had been widespread massacres of Protestants. For these reasons, the Protestant settler community fought en masse for William III. Many of the Williamite troops at the Boyne, including their very effective irregular cavalry, were Protestants from Ulster, who called themselves \"Eniskilleners\" and were referred to by contemporaries as \"Scotch-Irish.\"\nThe competing sides\nThe opposing armies in the battle were led by the Roman Catholic King James of England, Scotland and Ireland and opposing him, his son-in-law the Protestant William III (\"William of Orange\"), who had deposed James from his English and Scottish thrones in the previous year. James' supporters still controlled much of Ireland and the Irish Parliament. James also enjoyed the support of the French King, Louis XIV, who did not want to see a hostile monarch, such as William, on the throne of England. To support James' restoration, Louis sent 6000 French troops to Ireland to support the Irish Jacobites. William was already Stadtholder of the Netherlands and was able to call on Dutch and allied troops from continental Europe as well as from Great Britain.\nJames was a seasoned general who had proven his bravery when fighting for his brother\u2014King Charles II\u2014in Europe, notably at the battle of the Dunes in 1658. However, recent historians have noted that he was prone to panicking under pressure and to making rash decisions. William was also a seasoned commander and able general but had yet to win a full battle. Many of his battles ended in bloody stalemates, prompting at least one modern historian to argue that William lacked an ability to manage armies in the thick of battle. William's success against the French had been reliant upon tactical maneuvers and good diplomacy rather than force. His diplomacy had assembled the League of Augsburg\u2014a multi-national coalition formed to resist French aggression in Europe. From William's point of view, his takeover of power in England and the ensuing campaign in Ireland was just another front in the war against Louis XIV of France.\nJames II's subordinate commanders were Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, who was the Lord Deputy of Ireland and James's most powerful supporter in that country; and the French general Lauzun. William's second in command was the Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg, a 75 year old professional soldier. He had formerly been a Marshal of France, but had been expelled in 1685, from his native country by Louis XIV because he was a Huguenot Protestant.\nThe Williamite army at the Boyne was about 36,000 strong, composed of troops from many countries. Around 20,000 had been in Ireland since 1689, commanded by Schomberg. William himself arrived with 16,000 more in June 1690. William's troops were in general far better trained and equipped than were those of James. The best Williamite infantry were from Denmark and the Netherlands, professional soldiers equipped with the latest flintlock muskets. There were also a large contingent of French Huguenot troops fighting with the Williamites. William did not have a high opinion of his British troops, with the exception of the Ulster Protestant irregulars who had held Ulster in the previous year. The English and Scottish troops were felt to be politically unreliable, since James had been their legitimate monarch up to a year before. Moreover, they had only been raised recently and had seen little combat. The Jacobites were 23,500 strong. James had several regiments of French troops, but most of his manpower was provided by Irish Catholics. The Jacobite's Irish cavalry, who were raised from among the dispossessed Irish gentry, proved themselves to be high caliber troops at the battle. However, the Irish infantry, predominantly peasants who had been pressed into service, were not trained soldiers. They had been hastily trained, badly supplied, and only a minority of them had functional muskets. In fact, some of them at the Boyne carried only farm implements, such as scythes. On top of that, the Jacobite infantry who had firearms were all equipped with the obsolete matchlock musket.\nWilliam had landed in Carrickfergus in Ulster on June 14, 1690, and marched south to take Dublin. It has been argued that the Jacobites should have tried to block this advance in rugged country around Newry, on the present day Irish border. However, James only fought a delaying action there and chose instead to place his line of defense on the Boyne river, around 50 km from Dublin. The Williamites reached the Boyne on June 29. The day before the battle, William himself had a narrow escape, when he was wounded by Jacobite artillery while surveying the fords over which his troops would cross the river.\nThe battle itself was fought on July 1, over a ford of the Boyne at Oldbridge, near Drogheda. William sent about a quarter of his men to cross at a place called Roughgrange, near Slane, about 10 km from Oldbridge. The Duke of Schomberg's son, Meinhardt Schomberg, later the 3rd Duke led this crossing, which was unsuccessfully opposed by Irish dragoons. James panicked when he saw that he might be outflanked and sent half his troops, along with most of his cannon to counter this move. What neither side had realized was that there was a deep ravine at Roughgrange, so that the forces there could not engage each other, but literally sat out the battle. The Williamites there went on a long detour march which, late in the day, almost saw them cut off the Jacobite retreat at the village of Naul.\nAt the main ford at Oldbridge, William's infantry led by the elite Dutch Blue Guards forced their way across the river, using their superior firepower to slowly drive back the enemy foot-soldiers, but were pinned down by the counter-attacks of the Jacobite cavalry. Having secured the village of Oldbridge, some Williamite infantry held off successive cavalry attacks with disciplined volley fire while others were driven into the river. William's second in command, the Duke of Schomberg, and George Walker (1645-1690) were killed in this phase of the battle. The Williamites were not able to resume their advance until their own horsemen managed to cross the river and, after being badly mauled, held off the Jacobite cavalry, who retired and regrouped at Donore, where they once again put up stiff resistance before retiring. The Jacobites retired in good order. William had a chance to trap the retreating Jacobites as they crossed the river Nanny at Duleek, but was held up by a successful Jacobite rear-guard.\nThe casualty figure of the battle was quite low for a battle of such a scale\u2014of the 50,000 or so participants, about 2,000 died, three quarters of whom were Jacobites. The reason for the low death toll was that in contemporary warfare, most of the casualties tended to be inflicted in the pursuit of an already-beaten enemy. This did not happen at the Boyne because the counter-attacks of the Jacobite cavalry screened the retreat of the rest of their army. The Jacobites were badly demoralized by their defeat, however, and many of the Irish infantrymen deserted. The Williamites triumphantly marched into Dublin two days after the battle. The Jacobite army abandoned the city and marched to Limerick, behind the river Shannon, where they were besieged. James left so quickly that he outpaced the messenger that was sent to warn Limerick of the defeat.\nAfter his defeat, James quickly returned to exile in France, even though his army left the field relatively unscathed. James's loss of nerve and speedy exit from the battlefield enraged his Irish supporters, who fought on until the Treaty of Limerick in 1691.\nThe battle was overshadowed in its time in Great Britain by the destruction of the Anglo-Dutch fleet by the French two days later, off Beachy Head, a far more serious event in the short term; only on the Continent was the Boyne treated as a major victory. The reason for this was that it was the first proper victory for the League of Augsburg, the first ever alliance between Catholic and Protestant countries, and in achieving this William of Orange and Pope Alexander VIII (its prime movers) scotched the myth\u2014particularly emanating from Sweden\u2014that such an alliance was blasphemous, resulting in more joining the alliance and in effect ending the very real danger of a French conquest of Europe.\nThe Boyne was not without strategic significance on both Great Britain and Ireland, however. It marked the end of James's hope of regaining his throne by military means and virtually assured the triumph of the Glorious Revolution. In Scotland, news of this defeat led to the Highlanders gradually abandoning the Jacobite Rising which Bonnie Dundee had led. In Ireland, the Boyne was the beginning of the Williamite victory over the Jacobites, which maintained British and Protestant dominance over the country. For this reason, the Boyne is still celebrated by the Protestant Orange Order on the twelfth of July.\nCommemoration of the battle\nOriginally, Irish Protestants commemorated the Battle of Aughrim on the July 12, as symbolizing their victory in the Williamite war in Ireland. At Aughrim, which took place a year after the Boyne, virtually all of the old native Irish Catholic and Old English aristocracies plantations under Elizabeth I and Oliver Cromwell) were wiped out. The Boyne, which in the old Julian calendar, took place on July 1, was treated as less important, third in commemorative value after Aughrim and the anniversary of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 on October 23. What was celebrated on the twelfth was not William's \"victory over popery at the Battle of the Boyne,\" but the extermination of the elite of the native Irish at Aughrim, thereby ending the fear of having to surrender the planted lands.\nIn 1752, a new Gregorian calendar was introduced to the United Kingdom, which placed the Boyne on July 12, instead of Aughrim. However, even after this date, \"The Twelfth\" still commemorated Aughrim. But after the Orange Order was founded in 1795, amid sectarian violence in Armagh, the focus of parades on July 12, switched to the battle of the Boyne. Usually the dates before the introduction of the calendar on September 14, 1752, are mapped in English language histories directly onto the Julian dates without shifting them by 11 days. Being suspicious of anything with papist connotations, however, rather than shift the anniversary of the Boyne to the new July 1, or celebrate the new anniversary of Aughrim, the Orangemen continued to march on the July 12, which, in New Style dates marked the battle of the Boyne. Despite this, there are also smaller parades and demonstrations on July 1, the date which maps the old style date of the Boyne to the new style in the usual manner and which also commemorate the massacre of the 36th (Ulster) Division on the first day of the Battle of the Somme in 1916.\nIt has also been suggested that the Boyne was preferred to Aughrim because the Jacobites' rout there allowed the Irish Catholics to be presented as contemptible cowards, whereas at Aughrim they fought bravely and died in great numbers. In the context of a resurgent Irish nationalism from the 1790s onwards, it is argued that the narrative of the Boyne was more comforting for Loyalists in Ireland. The commemoration of the battle of the Boyne therefore has more to do with the politics of the Unionist community than it has to do with the military significance of the battle itself. It is not uncommon to see large murals of a monarch, William on a white horse at the head of his army marking out Loyalist territory.\nThe memory of the battle also has resonance among Irish Nationalists. Most Irish people see the battle as a major step on the road to the complete British colonization of Ireland. In 1923, Irish Republican Army members blew up a large monument to the battle on the battlefield site on the Boyne and also destroyed a statue of William III in 1929, that stood outside Trinity College Dublin in the center of the Irish capital.\n\"The Twelfth\" in Ireland today\nThe Battle of the Boyne remains a controversial topic today, especially in Northern Ireland where Protestants remember it as a great victory over Catholics and responsible for the sovereignty of Parliament and the 'Protestant monarchy'.\nIn recent years \"The Twelfth\" has often been marked by confrontations as members of the Orange Order attempt to celebrate the date by marching past or through what they see as their traditional route. However some of these areas now have a nationalist majority, who now object to marches passing through their areas. This is mainly due to population migrations caused by institutionalized sectarianism in Northern Ireland in the mid 1900s which had made Northern Ireland, in the words of Ulster Unionist Party leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner David Trimble, a \"cold house for Catholics\" at the time.\nEach side thus dresses up the disputes in terms of the other's supposed attempts to repress them; Catholics still see Orange Order marches as provocative attempts to 'show who is boss', while Protestants insist they have a right to \"walk the Queen's highway\" and see any attempt to deny them the right to walk through traditional routes used for centuries as an attempt to marginalise and restrict their freedom to celebrate their Protestant identity earned in the Glorious Revolution settlement. Thus the battle is still very present in the awareness of those involved in the Catholic-Protestant rivalry in Ireland.\nThe battlefield today\nThe site of the battle of the Boyne sprawls over a wide area west of the town of Drogheda. Oldbridge, the scene of the main Williamite crossing, has an Irish Government Interpretive Centre on it, which is dedicated to informing tourists and other visitors about the battle. This facility is currently being redeveloped. The other main combat areas on the day (at Duleek, Donore and Plattin\u2014along the Jacobite line of retreat) are marked with tourist information signs.\n- Hayes-McCoy, Gerard Anthony.

{"text":"Want to stay on top of all the space news? Follow @universetoday on Twitter\nSidereal Time is the time is takes for celestial bodies to ascend and descend in the night sky. We know that celestial bodies are in reality, fixed in their positions. The reason for their dramatic movement in the night is because of the rotation of the earth. This is the same reason why the Sun and the Moon seem to rise and set. For the longest time, this motion caused many philosophers and astronomers to assume that the Earth was the center of the Universe. Fortunately later astronomers like Copernicus were able to discern the true movements of the Earth, Moon, and Sun helping to explain their movements. The time that it takes for a star, planet or other fixed celestial body to ascend and descend in the night sky is also called sidereal period. Coincidentally this time corresponds to the time it takes for the Earth to rotate one revolution which is just under 24 hours.\nSidereal time is not like solar time which is measured by the movement of the sun. Or the lunar cycles which take about 28 days. It is the relative angle of a celestial object to the prime meridian of the vernal equinox of the earth. IF these terms are confusing, here is what they mean. In cartography, the Earth is bisected by two major lines of longitude and latitude. These lines are the 0 degree points on the globe. The 0 degree point for the latitude is the Equator the point where the Earth is perfectly bisected. It cut through South America and Africa. The 0 degree point for the longitude is the prime meridian. It exact location is Greenwich, UK. The Equinoxes are essentially the times of the year when the sun rise and sets at the exact same point of the horizon at the equator. This means that these are the only times the solar day is equally divided into 12 hours of day and 12 hours of night. The hour angle for a celestial object relative to this meridian is what we call sidereal time.This angle changes with the rotation of the Earth creating a pattern of ascension and descent for celestial bodies in the Earth\u2019s sky.\nWith the knowledge of sidereal time astronomers can predict the positions of stars. The values for the sidereal time of celestial objects is compile in a table or start chart called an ephemeris. With this guide to sidereal time astronomers can find a celestial object regardless of the change in their position over the year.\nThere are also some great resources on the net. The U.S. Naval observatory has an online clock to help you find out the sidereal time in your area. There is also a great explanation on the astronomy section of the Cornell university site.","id":"<urn:uuid:678e8811-82bd-4c27-af17-f540e64bc52a>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.universetoday.com\/35946\/sidereal-time\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9284169078,"token_count":564,"score":3.75,"int_score":4}

{"text":"Learning is the means whereby we acquire new working knowledge about the world. Memory is the means whereby we retain that knowledge over time. Our abilities to learn and remember are essential to our sense of self and our ability to function effectively in daily life. Memory is the glue that holds our mental life together. As a result, we are who we are in large part because of what we have learned and what we remember from past experience.\nBut what is memory? How does the brain capture and sustain it? Why does memory sometimes fail us? Those simple questions, of course, have exceedingly complex answers, and many biological details about the process of memory in humans and other animals remain unknown.\nHHMI investigator Eric R. Kandel of Columbia University, however, has provided a good start. His studies of the molecular basis of learning and memory underpin much of what we know about how events are recorded by the brain, processed by individual nerve cells, and etched in gray matter. For his work on learning and memory, Kandel was awarded a share of the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.\nIn the 1960s, Kandel began his studies of learning and memory by focusing on the behavior of the sea slug Aplysia, which he found to be a marvelously tractable system in which to study the cellular basis of these abilities. With only about 20,000 nerve cells \u2014 compared with the roughly thousand billion in humans \u2014 and a well-delineated neural circuitry, it proved possible to zero in on a biologically interesting reflex pathway. Like humans and other animals, Aplysia is capable of learning to modify this reflex, and this learning involves making memories.\nKandel found that the cellular basis for memory depends on persistent changes in synapses, the connections between nerve cells. The differences in the strength of these connections come about through learning. Kandel found that when, in the simple withdrawal reflex, the gill reacts to touch, the connection between the sensory nerve cell and motor nerve cell of the reflex are activated. When the sea slug was taught to ignore a harmless touch, the connections between the sensory nerve cell and motor cell weakened. When the same light touch was coupled to an unpleasant fearful stimulus the animal became sensitized. It would now react strongly to the light touch because the same set of connections had strengthened.\nKandel later discovered that short-term memory is kindled by the modulation of synapses and that long-term memory is sustained by the activation of genes. The formation of memories, Kandel determined, is a function of biochemical changes that occur at the synapse. To make short-term memories, the proteins involved in a chain of events at the nexus of nerve cells are chemically altered by the addition of phosphate groups. To cement a memory for the long haul, proteins are added at the synapse to make new connections with sensitization and lose connections with habituation.\nIn the 1990s, he turned from studying simple forms of learning to more complex forms using genetically modified mice and showed that similar principles for short and long term memory were at work here as well.\nBy laying a foundation for understanding the events that shape our ability to learn and remember, Kandel's work has helped us understand not only the cellular processes that occur during the acts of learning and remembering, but also - through his work on mice - where things can go wrong when dementia and other illnesses that affect memory arise. The cellular processes revealed by Kandel are among the targets of drugs used to alleviate these disorders of memory. Pinpointing the activity of individual nerve cells engaged in the process of learning and memory may help in the development of new, more effective agents to treat diseases that affect the brain.\nPhoto: Matthew Septimus","id":"<urn:uuid:6eafc168-0fd9-4248-ab08-030a35cb48b2>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.hhmi.org\/research\/nobel\/kandel.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9680238366,"token_count":755,"score":3.734375,"int_score":4}

All citizens share in the rights and the responsibilities of seeing that our public lands are cared for and managed in a way that meets the current and future needs of the American people.\nTo highlight the beauty, the accessibility, and the benefits of our public lands, the Public Lands Interpretive Association (PLIA), an Albuquerque, New Mexico-based non-profit organization that provides interpretive and educational resources to the public, mapped out a Canada-to-Mexico trek exclusively on public lands, called American Frontiers: A Public Lands Journey.\nThe Journey, or Trek,involved two groups of travelers: one starting north from the Mexican border and the second headed south from the Canadian. Their route lay entirely on public lands, a feat that has never been accomplished before. The trek began on July 31, 2002 and ended two months later when the two teams met in Wasatch-Cache National Forest near Salt Lake City, Utah on September 27.\nInspired by American Frontiers: A Public Lands Journey, National Geographic Society has designed its Geography Action! 2002 curriculum around the theme of public lands. Aimed at teaching school-aged children the beauty and the benefits of America's public lands, Geography Action! 2002 followed the trekkers along the two-month journey, highlighting the diversity and grandeur of our nation's public lands.\nTo demonstrate the different ways people get about on our public lands--and to stay within the 60-day limit of the journey--trek participants utilized numerous modes of transportation for this historic border-to-border journey across America. The hiked and backpacked, rode horses, mountain bikes, ATVs and dual sport motorcycles; rafted, canoed, drove pickup trucks, motorboats and 4WD vehicles, and even spent a few leisurely days on a houseboat.\nAlong the route the two teams attended special events, round table discussions, visited schools and communities to learn about public land issues. And, of course, they saw some of the most spectacular scenery of the American West. Their journal entries eloquently describe the feelings public lands awoke in them and also the daily routine of the long trek. You'll enjoy reading them.\nThree years in the making, American Frontiers: A Public Lands Journey has enlisted numerous partners and sponsors including the National Geographic Society, the Department of the Interior, the USDA Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, USGS, National Environmental Education and Training Foundation, Fire Wise Communities, American Honda, Kodak, the Coleman Company, and many others.

{"text":"||This article has multiple issues. Please help improve it or discuss these issues on the talk page.\nPreventive medicine or preventive care consists of measures taken to prevent diseases, (or injuries) rather than curing them or treating their symptoms. This contrasts in method with curative and palliative medicine, and in scope with public health methods (which work at the level of population health rather than individual health). Occupational medicine operates very often within the preventive medicine.\nPreventive medicine strategies are typically described as taking place at the primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary prevention levels. In addition, the term primal prevention has been used to describe all measures taken to ensure fetal well-being and prevent any long-term health consequences from gestational history and\/or disease. The rationale for such efforts is the evidence demonstrating the link between fetal well-being, or \"primal health,\" and adult health. Primal prevention strategies typically focus on providing future parents with: education regarding the consequences of epigenetic influences on their child, sufficient leave time for both parents or, for lack of it, at least some kin caregiving.\nSimple examples of preventive medicine include hand washing, breastfeeding, and immunizations. Preventive care may include examinations and screening tests tailored to an individual's age, health, and family history. For example, a person with a family history of certain cancers or other diseases would begin screening at an earlier age and\/or more frequently than those with no such family history. On the other side of preventive medicine, some nonprofit organizations, such as the Northern California Cancer Center, apply epidemiologic research towards finding ways to prevent diseases.\n|Prevention levels||Doctor\u2019s side|\n|Primary prevention||Methods to avoid occurrence of disease. Most population-based health promotion efforts are of this type.|\n|Secondary prevention||Methods to diagnose and treat existent disease in early stages before it causes significant morbidity.|\n|Tertiary prevention||Methods to reduce negative impact of existent disease by restoring function and reducing disease-related complications.|\n|Quaternary prevention||Methods to mitigate or avoid results of unnecessary or excessive interventions in the health system.|\nUniversal, selective, and indicated \nGordon (1987) in the area of disease prevention, and later Kumpfer and Baxley in the area of substance use proposed a three-tiered preventive intervention classification system: universal, selective, and indicated prevention. Amongst others, this typology has gained favour and is used by the U.S. Institute of Medicine, the NIDA and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.\n|Universal prevention||Involves whole population (nation, local community, school, district) and aims to prevent or delay the abuse of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. All individuals, without screening, are provided with information and skills needed to prevent the problem.|\n|Selective prevention||Involves groups whose risk of developing problems of alcohol abuse or dependence is above average. Subgroups may be distinguished by traits such as age, gender, family history, or economic status. For example, drug campaigns in recreational settings.|\n|Indicated prevention||Involves a screening process, and aims to identify individuals who exhibit early signs of substance abuse and other problem behaviours. Identifiers may include falling grades among students, known problem consumption or conduct disorders, alienation from parents, school, and positive peer groups etc.|\nOutside the scope of this three-tier model is environmental prevention. Environmental prevention approaches are typically managed at the regulatory or community level and focus on ways to deter drug consumption. Prohibition and bans (e.g. on smoking, alcohol advertising) may be viewed as the ultimate environmental restriction. However, in practice, environmental preventions programs embrace various initiatives at the macro and micro level, from government monopolies for alcohol sales through roadside sobriety or drug tests, worker\/pupil\/student drug testing, increased policing in sensitive settings (near schools, at rock festivals), and legislative guidelines aimed at precipitating punishments (warnings, penalties, fines).\nProfessionals involved in the public health aspect of this practice may be involved in entomology, pest control, and public health inspections. Public health inspections can include recreational waters, swimming pools, beaches, food preparation and serving, and industrial hygiene inspections and surveys.\nIn the United States, preventive medicine is a medical specialty, and has one of the 24 certifying boards recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) dedicated to it as well as one of the 18 certifying boards recognized by the American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists (AOABOS). It encompasses three areas of specialization:\n- General preventive medicine and public health\n- Aerospace medicine\n- Occupational medicine\nTo become board-certified in one of the preventive medicine areas of specialization, a licensed U.S. physician (M.D. or D.O.) must successfully complete a preventive medicine medical residency program following a one-year internship. Following that, the physician must pass the preventive medicine board examination. The residency program is at least two years in length and includes completion of a master's degree in public health (MPH) or equivalent. The board exam takes a full day: the morning session concentrates on general preventive medicine questions, while the afternoon session concentrates on the one of the three areas of specialization that the applicant has studied.\nIn addition, there are two subspecialty areas of certification:\nThese certifications require sitting for an examination following successful completion of an MT or UHB fellowship and prior board certification in one of the 24 ABMS-recognized specialties or 18 AOABOS-recognized specialties.\nProphylaxis (Greek: \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03c3\u03c9 to guard or prevent beforehand) is any medical or public health procedure whose purpose is to prevent, rather than treat or cure, a disease or other medical issue. In general terms, prophylactic measures are divided between primary prophylaxis (to prevent the development of a disease) and secondary prophylaxis (whereby the disease has already developed and the patient is protected against worsening of this process).\nSome specific examples of prophylaxis include:\n- Many vaccines are prophylactic, vaccines such as polio vaccine, smallpox vaccine, measles vaccine, mumps vaccine and others have greatly reduced many childhood diseases; HPV vaccines prevent certain cancers; influenza vaccine.\n- Birth control methods are used to prevent unwanted pregnancy. Condoms, for instance, are sometimes euphemistically referred to as \"prophylactics\" because of their use to prevent pregnancy, as well as the transmission of sexually transmitted infections.\n- Daily and moderate physical exercise in various forms can be called prophylactic because it can maintain or improve one's health. Cycling for transport appears to very significantly improve health by reducing risk of heart diseases, various cancers, muscular- and skeletal diseases, and overall mortality.\n- Eating plenty of fruits and vegetables each day may be prophylactic. It may reduce the risk of heart disease.\n- Fluoride therapy and tooth cleaning, either at home or by a professional, are parts of dental prophylaxis or oral prophylaxis.\n- Antibiotics are sometimes used prophylactically: For example, during the 2001 anthrax attacks scare in the United States, patients believed to be exposed were given ciprofloxacin. In similar manner, the use of antibiotic ointments on burns and other wounds is prophylactic. Antibiotics are also given prophylactically just before some medical procedures such as pacemaker insertion.\n- Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) may, with caution, be an example of a chronic migraine preventive (see amitriptyline and migraines' prevention by medicine).\n- Antimalarials such as chloroquine and mefloquine are used both in treatment and as prophylaxis by visitors to countries where malaria is endemic to prevent the development of the parasitic Plasmodium, which cause malaria.\n- Mechanical measures (such as graduated compression stockings or intermittent pneumatic compression) and drugs (such as low-molecular-weight heparin, unfractionated heparin, and fondaparinux) may be used in immobilized hospital patients at risk of venous thromboembolism.\n- Risk reducing or prophylactic mastectomies may be carried out for carriers of the BRCA mutation gene to minimise the risk of developing breast cancer.\n- Early and exclusive breastfeeding provides immunological protection against infectious diseases and well as reduced risk of chronic diseases for both mother and child.\n- Polypill for prevention of e.g. cardiovascular disease.\n- Potassium iodide is used prophylactically to protect the thyroid gland from absorbing inhaled or ingested radioactive iodine, which may lead to the development of thyroid cancer; radioactive iodine may be released into the environment in the event of an accident at a nuclear power plant, or the detonation of a nuclear explosive (see thyroid protection due to nuclear accidents and emergencies).\n- Prophylaxis may be administered as oral medication. Oral prophylaxis includes: PEP, nPEP, or PrEP. PEP stands for post-exposure prophylaxis used in an occupational setting e.g., to prevent the spread of HIV or Hepatitis C from patient to staff following an accidental needlestick. nPEP is non-occupational post-exposure prophylaxis. nPEP may be used in a sexual or injection exposure to HIV, hepatitis, or other infectious agents; for example, during intercourse, if the condom breaks and one partner is HIV-positive, nPEP will help to decrease the probability that the HIV-negative partner becomes infected with HIV. (An nPEP is sometimes known as a PEPse - i.e. post-exposure prophylaxis sexual encounter.) PrEP is a measure taken daily (before, during, and after) possible exposure; for example, by a person who inconsistently uses condoms during sex with a partner who may have an HIV infection.\nSince preventive medicine deals with healthy individuals or populations the costs and potential harms from interventions need even more careful examination than in treatment. For an intervention to be applied widely it generally needs to be affordable and highly cost effective.\nFor instance, intrauterine devices (IUD) are highly effective and highly cost effective contraceptives, however where universal health care is not available the initial cost may be a barrier. IUDs work for several years (3 to 7 or more) and cost less over a year or two's time than most other reversible contraceptive methods. They are also highly cost effective, saving health insurers and the public significant costs in unwanted pregnancies. Making contraceptives available with no up front cost is one way to increase usage, improving health and saving money.\nPreventive solutions may be less profitable and therefore less attractive to makers and marketers of pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Birth control pills which are taken every day and may take in a thousand dollars over ten years may generate more profits than an IUD, which despite a huge initial markup only generates a few hundred dollars over the same period.\nLeading cause of preventable death \n|Cause||Deaths caused (millions per year)|\n|Sexually transmitted infections||3.0|\n|Overweight and obesity||2.5|\n|Indoor air pollution from solid fuels||1.8|\n|Unsafe water and poor sanitation||1.6|\n|Intervention||Percent of all child deaths preventable|\n|Water, sanitation, hygiene||3|\n|Newborn temperature management||2|\n|Nevirapine and replacement feeding||2|\n|Antibiotics for premature rupture of membranes||1|\n|Antimalarial intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy||<1%|\n|Cause||Deaths caused||% of all deaths|\n|Poor diet and physical inactivity||365,000||15.2|\n|Sexually transmitted infections||20,000||0.8|\nSee also \n- American Board of Preventive Medicine\n- European College of Preventive and Lifestyle Medicine\n- American Osteopathic Board of Preventive Medicine\n- Mental illness prevention\n- Monitoring (medicine)\n- Post-exposure prophylaxis\n- Pre-exposure prophylaxis\n- Preventive Medicine (journal)\n- Prophylactic rule\n- Preventive Medicine at the US National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)\n- Primal Research Centre, London\n- Primal Health Research Databank\n- Effect of In Utero and Early-Life Conditions on Adult Health and Disease, by P.D.Gluckman et al., N ENGL J MED 359;1\n- Origins: How the nine months before birth shape the rest of your life, by Annie Murphy Paul, Time magazine, 176.14, 2010\n- Kuehlein T, Sghedoni D, Visentin G, G\u00e9rvas J, Jamoule M.

{"text":"by +Richard Holbrooke \u2013 Schwann cells boost and amplify nerve growth in animal models, but their clinical use has been held back because they are difficult, time-consuming and costly to culture.\nA University of Sheffield team, led by Professor John Haycock, has developed a new technique with adult rat tissue which overcomes all these problems, producing Schwann cells in less than half the time and at much lower cost.\n\u201cThe ability of Schwann cells to boost nerve growth was proved many years ago in animals, but if you want to use this technique with patients, the problem is: where do you get enough cells from?\u201d said Professor Haycock, from the University\u2019s Department of Materials Science and Engineering.\n\u201cTo reduce immune rejection, the cells have to be grown from the patient\u2019s own tissue. Of course, you want to take the smallest amount of tissue necessary, so the technique must be efficient. It must also be fast, so treatment can begin as soon as possible after injury. For clinical use, it must also provide pure Schwann cells. And finally, to make it viable, it has to be at a reasonable cost.\u201d\nExisting methods for growing Schwann cells from adult tissue promote the growth of another type of cell, called fibroblasts, which swamp the Schwann cells, reducing the speed they grow and their numbers. This means that large amounts of tissue are needed at the outset, to grow sufficient cells for therapeutic use. It also requires extra purification stages added to the process, making it slow and costly \u2013 taking up to 3 months to complete.\nProfessor Haycock and his team have come up with a very simple solution: feed the Schwann cells but starve the fibroblasts. The research, published today in Nature Protocols, uses an amino acid that only the Schwann cells can break down and feed off, and are able to produce a 97 per cent pure population of Schwann cells in a much shorter space of time \u2013 just 19 days \u2013 from a small sample of adult tissue.\nProfessor Haycock is confident the technique can be replicated in humans. His team are trialling the same method using human nerve tissue, with results expected within the next six months.","id":"<urn:uuid:8e7cb7c1-ff22-4b2a-8b76-a1a0ed11dec6>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/floridabiotechnews.com\/biotech\/new-technique-could-bring-cell-therapy-for-nerve-damage-a-step-closer\/10917\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9612704515,"token_count":460,"score":3.265625,"int_score":3}
{"text":"|Birth name||Norman Percevel Rockwell|\nFebruary 3, 1894|\nNew York City\n|Died||November 8, 1978\n|Training||National Academy of Design\nArt Students League\nNorman Percevel Rockwell (February 3, 1894 \u2013 November 8, 1978) was a 20th-century American painter and illustrator. His works enjoy a broad popular appeal in the United States for their reflection of American culture. Rockwell is most famous for the cover illustrations of everyday life scenarios he created for The Saturday Evening Post magazine for more than four decades. Among the best-known of Rockwell's works are the Willie Gillis series, Rosie the Riveter, Saying Grace (1951), The Problem We All Live With, and the Four Freedoms series. He is also noted for his work for the Boy Scouts of America (BSA); producing covers for their publication Boys' Life, calendars, and other illustrations.\nLife and works \nEarly life \nNorman Rockwell was born on February 3, 1894, in New York City to Jarvis Waring Rockwell and Anne Mary \"Nancy\" (born Hill) Rockwell. His earliest American ancestor was John Rockwell (1588\u20131662), from Somerset, England, who immigrated to America probably in 1635 aboard the ship Hopewell and became one of the first settlers of Windsor, Connecticut. He had one brother, Jarvis Waring Rockwell, Jr., older by a year and a half. Jarvis Waring, Sr., was the manager of the New York office of a Philadelphia textile firm, George Wood, Sons & Company, where he spent his entire career.\nNorman transferred from high school to the Chase Art School at the age of 14. He then went on to the National Academy of Design and finally to the Art Students League. There, he was taught by Thomas Fogarty, George Bridgman, and Frank Vincent DuMond; his early works were produced for St. Nicholas Magazine, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) publication Boys' Life and other juvenile publications. Joseph Csatari carried on his legacy and style for the BSA.\nAs a student, Rockwell was given smaller, less important jobs. His first major breakthrough came in 1912 at age eighteen with his first book illustration for Carl H. Claudy's Tell Me Why: Stories about Mother Nature.\nIn 1913, the nineteen-year-old Rockwell became the art editor for Boys' Life, published by the Boy Scouts of America, a post he held for three years (1913\u20131916). As part of that position, he painted several covers, beginning with his first published magazine cover, Scout at Ship's Wheel, appearing on the Boys' Life September 1913 edition.\nWorld War I \nDuring World War I, he tried to enlist into the U.S. Navy but was refused entry because, at 6 feet (1.8 m) tall and 140 pounds (64 kg) he was eight pounds underweight. To compensate, he spent one night gorging himself on bananas, liquids and doughnuts, and weighed enough to enlist the next day. However, he was given the role of a military artist and did not see any action during his tour of duty.\nRockwell's family moved to New Rochelle, New York when Norman was 21 years old and shared a studio with the cartoonist Clyde Forsythe, who worked for The Saturday Evening Post. With Forsythe's help, he submitted his first successful cover painting to the Post in 1916, Mother's Day Off (published on May 20). He followed that success with Circus Barker and Strongman (published on June 3), Gramps at the Plate (August 5), Redhead Loves Hatty Perkins (September 16), People in a Theatre Balcony (October 14) and Man Playing Santa (December 9). Rockwell was published eight times total on the Post cover within the first twelve months. Norman Rockwell published a total of 323 original covers for The Saturday Evening Post over 47 years. His Sharp Harmony appeared on the cover of the issue dated September 26, 1936; it depicts a barber and three clients, enjoying an a cappella song. The image was adopted by SPEBSQSA in its promotion of the art.\nRockwell's success on the cover of the Post led to covers for other magazines of the day, most notably The Literary Digest, The Country Gentleman, Leslie's Weekly, Judge, Peoples Popular Monthly and Life Magazine.\nPersonal life \nRockwell married his first wife, Irene O'Connor, in 1916. Irene was Rockwell's model in Mother Tucking Children into Bed, published on the cover of The Literary Digest on January 19, 1921. However, the couple were divorced in 1930. Depressed, he moved briefly to Alhambra, California as a guest of his old friend Clyde Forsythe. There he painted some of his best-known paintings including \"The Doctor and the Doll\". While there he met and married schoolteacher Mary Barstow. The couple returned to New York shortly after their marriage. They had three children: Jarvis Waring, Thomas Rhodes and Peter Barstow. The family lived at 24 Lord Kitchener Road in the Bonnie Crest neighborhood of New Rochelle, New York. Rockwell and his wife were not very religious, although they were members of St. John's Wilmot Church, an Episcopal church near their home, and had their sons baptized there as well. Rockwell moved to Arlington, Vermont, in 1939 where his work began to reflect small-town life.\nIn 1953, the Rockwell family moved to Stockbridge, Massachusetts, so that his wife could be treated at the Austen Riggs Center, a psychiatric hospital at 25 Main Street, down Main Street from where Rockwell set up his studio. Rockwell himself received psychiatric treatment from the analyst Erik Erikson, who was on staff at Riggs. Erikson is said to have told the artist that he painted his happiness, but did not live it. In 1959, Mary Barstow Rockwell died unexpectedly of a heart attack.\nWorld War II \nIn 1943, during World War II, Rockwell painted the Four Freedoms series, which was completed in seven months and resulted in his losing 15 pounds. The series was inspired by a speech by Franklin D. Roosevelt, in which he described four principles for universal rights: Freedom from Want, Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Worship, and Freedom from Fear. The paintings were published in 1943 by The Saturday Evening Post. The United States Department of the Treasury later promoted war bonds by exhibiting the originals in 16 cities. Rockwell himself considered \"Freedom of Speech\" to be the best of the four. That same year, a fire in his studio destroyed numerous original paintings, costumes, and props.\nShortly after the war, Rockwell was contacted by writer Elliott Caplin, brother of cartoonist Al Capp, with the suggestion that the three of them should make a daily comic strip together, with Caplin and his brother writing and Rockwell drawing. King Features Syndicate is reported to have promised a $1,000\/week deal, knowing that a Capp-Rockwell collaboration would gain strong public interest. However, the project was ultimately aborted as it turned out that Rockwell, known for his perfectionism as an artist, could not deliver material as fast as required of him for a daily comic strip.\nDuring the late 1940s, Norman Rockwell spent the winter months as artist-in-residence at Otis College of Art and Design. Students occasionally were models for his Saturday Evening Post covers. In 1949, Rockwell donated an original Post cover, \"April Fool\", to be raffled off in a library fund raiser.\nIn 1959, his wife Mary died unexpectedly from a heart attack, and Rockwell took time off from his work to grieve. It was during that break that he and his son Thomas produced his autobiography, My Adventures as an Illustrator, which was published in 1960. The Post printed excerpts from this book in eight consecutive issues, the first containing Rockwell's famous Triple Self-Portrait.\nLater career \nRockwell married his third wife, retired Milton Academy English teacher Mary Leete \"Molly\" Punderson, on October 25, 1961. His last painting for the Post was published in 1963, marking the end of a publishing relationship that had included 321 cover paintings. He spent the next ten years painting for Look magazine, where his work depicted his interests in civil rights, poverty and space exploration. In 1968, Rockwell was commissioned to do an album cover portrait of Mike Bloomfield and Al Kooper for their record The Live Adventures of Mike Bloomfield and Al Kooper. During his long career, he was commissioned to paint the portraits for Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon, as well as those of foreign figures, including Gamal Abdel Nasser and Jawaharlal Nehru. One of his last works was a portrait of Judy Garland in 1969.\nA custodianship of his original paintings and drawings was established with Rockwell's help near his home in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, and the Norman Rockwell Museum is still open today year round. Norman Rockwell Museum is the authoritative source for all things Norman Rockwell. The museum's collection is the world's largest, including more than 700 original Rockwell paintings, drawings, and studies. The Rockwell Center for American Visual Studies at the Norman Rockwell Museum is a national research institute dedicated to American illustration art.\nWhen he began suffering poor health, he placed his studio and the contents with the Norman Rockwell Museum, which was formerly known as the Stockbridge Historical Society and even more formerly known as the Old Corner house, in a trust.\nFor \"vivid and affectionate portraits of our country,\" Rockwell received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States of America's highest civilian honor, in 1977.\nBody of work \nNorman Rockwell was a prolific artist, producing over 4,000 original works in his lifetime. Most of his works are either in public collections, or have been destroyed in fire or other misfortunes. Rockwell was also commissioned to illustrate over 40 books including Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. His annual contributions for the Boy Scouts' calendars between 1925 and 1976 (Rockwell was a 1939 recipient of the Silver Buffalo Award, the highest adult award given by the Boy Scouts of America), were only slightly overshadowed by his most popular of calendar works: the \"Four Seasons\" illustrations for Brown & Bigelow that were published for 17 years beginning in 1947 and reproduced in various styles and sizes since 1964. Illustrations for booklets, catalogs, posters (particularly movie promotions), sheet music, stamps, playing cards, and murals (including \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" and \"God Bless the Hills\", which was completed in 1936 for the Nassau Inn in Princeton, New Jersey) rounded out Rockwell's \u0153uvre as an illustrator.\nIn 1969, as a tribute to Rockwell's 75th-year birthday, officials of Brown & Bigelow and the Boy Scouts of America asked Rockwell to pose in Beyond the Easel, the calendar illustration that year.\nRockwell's work was dismissed by serious art critics in his lifetime. Many of his works appear overly sweet in modern critics' eyes, especially the Saturday Evening Post covers, which tend toward idealistic or sentimentalized portrayals of American life \u2013 this has led to the often-deprecatory adjective \"Rockwellesque\". Consequently, Rockwell is not considered a \"serious painter\" by some contemporary artists, who often regard his work as bourgeois and kitsch. Writer Vladimir Nabokov sneered that Rockwell's brilliant technique was put to \"banal\" use, and wrote in his book Pnin: \"That Dal\u00ed is really Norman Rockwell's twin brother kidnapped by Gypsies in babyhood\". He is called an \"illustrator\" instead of an artist by some critics, a designation he did not mind, as it was what he called himself.\nHowever, in his later years, Rockwell began receiving more attention as a painter when he chose more serious subjects such as the series on racism for Look magazine. One example of this more serious work is The Problem We All Live With, which dealt with the issue of school racial integration. The painting depicts a young African American girl, Ruby Bridges, flanked by white federal marshals, walking to school past a wall defaced by racist graffiti.\nRockwell's work was exhibited at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 2001. Rockwell's Breaking Home Ties sold for $15.4 million at a 2006 Sotheby's auction. A twelve-city U.S. tour of Rockwell's works took place in 2008. In 2008, Rockwell was named the official state artist of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n- In the film Empire of the Sun, a young boy (played by Christian Bale) is put to bed by his loving parents in a scene also inspired by a Rockwell painting\u2014a reproduction of which is later kept by the young boy during his captivity in a prison camp (\"Freedom from Fear\", 1943).\n- The 1994 film Forrest Gump includes a shot in a school that re-creates Rockwell's \"Girl with Black Eye\" with young Forrest in place of the girl. Much of the film drew heavy visual inspiration from Rockwell's art.\n- Film director George Lucas owns Rockwell's original of \"The Peach Crop\", and his colleague Steven Spielberg owns a sketch of Rockwell's Triple Self-Portrait. Each of the artworks hangs in the respective filmmaker's workspace. Rockwell is a major character in an episode of Lucas\u2019 Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, \u201cPassion for Life.\u201d\n- In 2005, Target Co. sold Marshall Field's to Federated Department Stores and the Federated discovered a reproduction of Rockwell's The Clock Mender, which depicted the great clocks of the Marshall Field and Company Building on display. Rockwell had donated the painting depicted on the cover of the November 3, 1945 Saturday Evening Post to the store in 1948.\n- On Norman Rockwell's birthday, February 3, 2010, Google featured Rockwell's iconic image of young love \"Boy and Girl Gazing at the Moon\", which is also known as \"Puppy Love\", on its home page.

{"text":"A bullock cart or ox cart is a two-wheeled or four-wheeled vehicle pulled by oxen (draught cattle). It is a means of transportation used since ancient times in many parts of the world. They are still used today where modern vehicles are too expensive or the infrastructure does not favor them.\nUsed especially for carrying goods, the bullock cart is pulled by one or several oxen (bullocks). The cart (also known as a jinker) is attached to a bullock team by a special chain attached to yokes, but a rope may also be used for one or two animals. The driver and any other passengers sit on the front of the cart, while load is placed in the back. Traditionally the cargo was usually agrarian goods and lumber.\nCosta Rica \nIn Costa Rica, ox carts (carretas in the Spanish language) were an important aspect of the daily life and commerce, especially between 1850 to 1935, developing a unique construction and decoration tradition that is still being developed. Costa Rican parades and traditional celebrations are not complete without a traditional ox cart parade.\nIn 1988, the traditional ox cart was declared as National Symbol of Work by the Costa Rican government.\nIn 2005, the \"Oxherding and Oxcart Traditions in Costa Rica\" were included in UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\nIn Indonesia, Bullock Carts are commonly used in the rural parts of the country, where it is used for transporting goods and carriages and also people. But it is mostly common in Indonesia that there are Horse Car than Bullock Carts on the streets of Indonesia.\nBullock carts were widely used in Malaysia before the introduction of automobiles, and many are still used today. These included passenger vehicles, now used especially for tourists. Passenger carts are usually equipped with awnings for protection against sun and rain, and are often gaily decorated.\nSee also \n|Wikimedia Commons has media related to: Ox-drawn carts|","id":"<urn:uuid:4dcad241-2b6b-4970-9112-c67a47a29a2c>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bullock_cart","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.964052856,"token_count":415,"score":3.453125,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Healthy Eating Plate\nHarvard\u2019s New Guide to Healthy Eating\nStart here to learn more about the new Healthy Eating Plate created by nutrition experts at Harvard School of Public Health, in conjunction with Harvard Health Publications. The Healthy Eating Plate can be your blueprint for planning a healthy balanced meal, and it fixes key flaws in the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s MyPlate.\nHow can you follow the Healthy Eating Plate? Here\u2019s a rundown, section by section:\n- Fill half of your plate with vegetables and fruits. The more color, and the more variety on this part of the plate, the better. Potatoes and French fries don\u2019t count as vegetables on the Healthy Eating Plate, because they are high in fast-digested starch (carbohydrate), which has the same roller-coaster effect on blood sugar and insulin as white bread and sweets. These surges, in the short term, can lead to hunger and overeating, and in the long term, can lead to weight gain, type 2 diabetes, and other health problems. Read more about vegetables and fruits, or read more about carbohydrates and health.\n- Save a quarter of your plate for whole grains\u2014not just any grains: Whole grains\u2014whole wheat, brown rice, and foods made with them, such as whole wheat pasta\u2014have a gentler effect on blood sugar and insulin than white bread, white rice, and other so-called \u201crefined grains.\u201d That\u2019s why the Healthy Eating Plate says to choose whole grains\u2014the less processed, the better\u2014and limit refined grains. Read more about whole grains.\n- Put a healthy source of protein on one quarter of your plate: Chose fish, chicken, beans or nuts, since these contain beneficial nutrients, such as the heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids in fish, and the fiber in beans. An egg a day is okay for most people, too (people with diabetes should limit their egg intake to three yolks a week, but egg whites are fine). Limit red meat\u2014beef, pork, and lamb\u2014and avoid processed meats\u2014bacon, cold cuts, hot dogs, and the like\u2014since over time, regularly eating even small amounts of these foods raises the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and colon cancer. Read more about healthy proteins.\n- Use healthy plant oils. The glass bottle near the Healthy Eating Plate is a reminder to use healthy vegetable oils, like olive, canola, soy, corn, sunflower, peanut, and others, in cooking, on salad, and at the table. Limit butter, and avoid unhealthy trans fats from partially hydrogenated oils. Read more about healthy fats.\n- Drink water, coffee or tea. On the Healthy Eating Plate, complete your meal with a glass of water, or if you like, a cup of tea or coffee (with little or no sugar). (Questions about caffeine and kids? Read more.) Limit milk and dairy products to one to two servings per day, since high intakes are associated with increased risk of prostate cancer and possibly ovarian cancer. Limit juice to a small glass per day, since it is as high in sugar as a sugary soda. Skip the sugary drinks, since they provide lots of calories and virtually no other nutrients. And over time, routinely drinking sugary drinks can lead to weight gain, increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, and possibly increase the risk of heart disease. Read more about healthy drinks, or read more about calcium, milk, and health.\n- Stay active. The small red figure running across the Healthy Eating Plate\u2019s placemat is a reminder that staying active is half of the secret to weight control. The other half is eating a healthy diet with modest portions that meet your calorie needs. Read 20 tips for staying active.\nComparing the Harvard Healthy Eating Plate to the USDA\u2019s MyPlate shows the shortcomings of MyPlate. Read a head-to-head comparison of the Healthy Eating Plate vs. the USDA\u2019s MyPlate.\nYou can use the Healthy Eating Plate side by side with the Healthy Eating Pyramid, a simple and trustworthy guide to healthy eating created by faculty in the Department of Nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health.

{"text":"On Monday the American Library Association will announce the winner of its highest award for a picture book, named for the great English illustrator Randolph Caldecott (1846\u20131886). Why was Caldecott so important? Here\u2019s an answer from Maurice Sendak, who won the Caldecott Medal for Where the Wild Things Are:\n\u201cCaldecott\u2019s work heralds the beginning of the modern picture book. He devised an ingenious juxtaposition of picture and word, a counterpoint that had never happened before. Words are left out \u2013 but the picture says it. Pictures are left out \u2013 but the word says it. In short, it is the invention of the picture book.\u201d\n* * *\n\u201cMy favorite example of Caldecott\u2019s fearless honesty is the final page of Hey Diddle Diddle. After we read, \u2018And the Dish ran away with the spoon,\u2019 accompanied by a drawing of the happy couple, there is the shock of turning the page and finding a picture of the dish broken into ten pieces \u2013 obviously dead \u2013 and the spoon being hustled away by her angry parents. There are no words that suggest such an end to the adventure; it is purely a Caldecottian invention. Apparently, he could not resist enlarging the dimensions of this jaunty nursery rhyme by adding a last sorrowful touch.\u201d\nMaurice Sendak in Caldecott & Co.: Notes on Books & Pictures (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1988), a collection of Sendak\u2019s reviews and other writing for adults. The first quote comes from his essay \u201cRandolph Caldecott\u201d and the second from his acceptance speech for the 1964 Caldecott Medal. Sendak is one of the few great picture-book artists who is also a great critic. Caldecott & Co. has only a dozen pages of pictures but doesn\u2019t need more, because Sendak makes you see books without them.\n(c) 2008 Janice Harayda.

In: Tribology International, 39 (2). pp. 175-183.\nRestricted to Registered users only\nDownload (562Kb) | Request a copy\nFriction influences the nature of transfer layer formed at the interface between die and sheet during forming. In the present investigation, basic studies were conducted using 'Inclined Scratch Test' to understand the mechanism of transfer layer formation during sliding of pins made of an Al-Mg alloy on EN8 steel flats of different surface roughness under dry and lubricated conditions. The surfaces produced can be categorized into three different types: (a) uni-directional (b) 8-ground and (c) random. Rubbing the EN8 flat in a uni-directional manner and a criss-cross manner on emery sheets produced the uni-directional and 8 ground surfaces. The random surfaces were produced by polishing the EN8 flats using various abrasive powders. The influence of the 'nature of surface roughness' on material transfer and coefficient of friction were investigated. Scanning Electron Microscopy studies were performed on the contact surfaces of the Al-Mg alloy pins and EN8 steel flats to reveal the morphology of the transfer layer obtained. It was seen that the transfer layer is dependant on the coefficient of friction. The coefficient of friction, which has two components-the adhesion component and the plowing component, is controlled by the 'nature of surface'. A surface that promotes plane strain conditions near the surfaces increases the plowing component of friction.\n|Item Type:||Journal Article|\n|Additional Information:||Copyright for this article belongs to Elsevier.|\n|Keywords:||Friction; Nature of surface; Inclined scratch|\n|Department\/Centre:||Division of Mechanical Sciences > Materials Engineering (formerly Metallurgy)\nDivision of Mechanical Sciences > Mechanical Engineering\n|Date Deposited:||19 Jan 2006|\n|Last Modified:||19 Sep 2010 04:23|\nActions (login required)","id":"<urn:uuid:29ad99f8-17dd-4bf4-9973-88d9fa050e74>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/eprints.iisc.ernet.in\/5163\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.8691422939,"token_count":457,"score":2.59375,"int_score":3}
{"text":"What Is It?\nFertility awareness is a way to prevent pregnancy by not having sex around the time of ovulation (the release of an egg during a girl's monthly cycle). Couples who do want to have a baby can also use this method to have sex during the time that they are most likely to conceive. Fertility awareness can include methods such as natural family planning, periodic abstinence, and the rhythm method.\nHow Does It Work?\nIf a couple doesn't have sex around the time of ovulation, the girl is less likely to get pregnant. The trick is knowing when ovulation happens. Couples use a calendar, a thermometer to measure body temperature, the thickness of cervical mucus, or a kit that tests for ovulation. The ovulation kits are more useful for couples who are trying to get pregnant. The fertile period around ovulation lasts 6 to 9 days and during this time the couple using only fertility awareness for birth control who does not want to get pregnant should not have sex.\nHow Well Does It Work?\nFertility awareness is not a reliable way to prevent pregnancy for most teens. Over the course of 1 year, as many as 25 out of 100 typical couples who rely on fertility awareness to prevent pregnancy will have an accidental pregnancy. Of course, this is an average figure, and the chance of getting pregnant depends on whether a couple uses one or more of the fertility awareness methods correctly and consistently and does not have unprotected sex during the fertile period.\nIn general, how well each type of birth control method works depends on a lot of things. These include whether a person has any health conditions, is taking any medications that might interfere with its use, whether the method chosen is convenient \u2014 and whether it is used correctly all the time. In the case of fertility awareness, it also depends on how consistent a woman's ovulatory cycle is, how accurately a couple keeps track of when she could be ovulating, and how reliably unprotected sex is avoided during the fertile period.\nProtection Against STDs\nAbstinence (not having sex) is the only method that always prevents pregnancy and STDs.\nWho Uses It?\nFertility awareness is not a reliable way to prevent pregnancy for most teens. It is often very difficult to tell when a girl is fertile. Because teens often have irregular menstrual cycles, it makes predicting ovulation much more difficult. Even people who have previously had regular cycles can have irregular timing of ovulation when factors such as stress or illness are involved. Fertility awareness also requires a commitment to monitoring body changes, keeping daily records, and above all not having sex during the fertile period.\nHow Do You Get It?\nFor couples interested in this method, it is best to talk to a doctor or counselor who is trained in fertility awareness. He or she can then teach the couple the skills they need to know to practice this birth control method accurately.\nHow Much Does It Cost?\nThe tools needed for fertility awareness \u2014 such as ovulation detection kits and thermometers, for example \u2014 are available in drugstores. But they can be expensive. Again, it's best to talk to a doctor for advice on using this method.\nReviewed by: Larissa Hirsch, MD\nDate reviewed: April 2010\nShare this page using:\nNote: All information on TeensHealth\u00ae is for educational purposes only.

Common techniques that use DNA, such as sequencing, cDNA synthesis and cloning, RNA transcription, transfection, nucleic acid labeling (e.g., random prime labeling), etc., all benefit from a defined template concentration. Failure to produce results from these techniques sometimes can be attributed to an incorrect estimate of the DNA template used. The concentration of a nucleic acid most commonly is measured by UV absorbance at 260nm (A260).

{"text":"Within the next 10 years the EU-funded Diabetes Prevention study, part of an international study called TRIGR (Trial to Reduce IDDM in the Genetically at Risk), coordinated at the University of Helsinki, Finland, will generate a definite answer to the question whether early nutritional modification may prevent type 1 diabetes later in childhood.\nType 1 diabetes is a growing health problem among European children. European data indicate that the disease incidence has increased five-six-fold among children under the age of 15 years after World War II, and there are no signs that the increase in incidence is levelling off. The most conspicuous increase has been seen among children under the age of 5 years.\nThe TRIGR study is the first study ever aimed at primary prevention of type 1 diabetes. The study is designed to answer to the question whether excluding cow's milk protein from the infant's diet decreases the risk of fu-ture diabetes. All subjects are followed for 10 years to get information on whether the dietary recommendations for infants at increased genetic risk of type 1 diabetes should be revised.\nStarting in May 2002, 76 study centres from 15 countries (Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and USA) have been recruiting families for the study. To be eligible the newborn infant has to have at least one family member (mother, father and\/or sib) affected by type 1 diabetes and carry a HLA genotype conferring increased risk for type 1 diabetes. The initial recruitment target of 2032 eligible infants was reached at the be-ginning of September 2006, but the Study Group has decided to continue recruitment till the end of December 2006 (when the EU contribution will finish) to make the study even more powerful statistically.\nA majority of the study participants (52%) have been recruited in Europe. The International Coordinating Cen-tre (ICC) is located at the University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland and the Data Management Unit (DMU) at the University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida, USA. The trial has logistically been a true challenge for both the ICC and DMU. DMU has been successful in establishing a secure, real-time, web-based, interactive data management system that works extremely well. This system can be directly applied to future international mul-ticentre studies.\nThe TRIGR study is generating a wealth of information on breast-feeding practices, infant nutrition and growth in young children in various countries. At 2 weeks of age almost all the participating infants were breast-fed. Exclusive breast-feeding continued longer in Europe than in North America. More than one third of the infants (35 %) received other foods in addition to breast milk and\/or infant formulas at the age of 4 months, while WHO recommends that supplementary food should be introduced at the earliest by the age of 6 months. In Europe the first foods to be introduced are typically vegetables and fruits, whereas gluten-free cereals are most commonly introduced in North America.\nNewborn infants in Northern Europe (NE) had a higher birth weight but a shorter birth length than infants in Central and Southern Europe (CSE). The NE children remained heavier than those from CSE at least up to the age of 18 months. The NE children were also taller than the CSE children starting already from the age of 3 months up to the age of 18 months. Accelerated growth in infancy has been identified as a risk factor for type 1 diabetes later in childhood. Accordingly the observed growth pattern may contribute to the higher incidence of type 1 diabetes in NE compared to CSE.\nProfessor Mikael Knip, University of Helsinki\nPhone: +358 40 844 7671\nStudy websites: http:\/\/www.trigr.org\nLast reviewed: By John M.

{"text":"Background information about dementia and home care services\nIn Spain, the provision of home care services is in the stage of development with about 20% of communes offering such services. However, this is not sufficient to cover demand and it is estimated that only about 1% of the elderly receive home care services provided by the government. The main aim of social services network is to keep elderly people in their homes for as long as possible.\nThe vast majority of elderly dependent people have to rely on services provided by informal carers. Care of elderly and dependent people tends to be seen as a family obligation. However, according to a survey carried out in 2001, only 24% of the population believe that children will continue to bear the responsibility for caring for their elderly parents in the future and the number of elderly people living alone is steadily increasing (Larizgoitia Jauregi, 2004)\nLegislation relating to the provision of home care services\nThe Spanish constitution states that all citizens are entitled to \u201chealth protection\u201d. The General Health Law of 1986, which saw the creation of the National Health System, also states that access to health services is a citizen\u2019s right.\nIn the Spanish Civil Code (Book 1), it is stated that the spouse and children of elderly dependent people are responsible for their maintenance and care which covers everything that is essential for sustenance, shelter, clothing and medical assistance. The extent of the maintenance to be provided depends on the means of the providers and the needs of the dependent person. The obligation to provide maintenance comes to an end when the provider dies or when their wealth has fallen to such a level that continuing to do so would mean having to neglect their own needs or those of their family.\nBrothers and sisters also have an obligation to provide maintenance but they come after spouses and descendants, but this obligation is limited to what is absolutely necessary Kerschen et al., 2005).\nCitizens\u2019 do not have a legally established right to social services. The provision of such services is at the discretion of the Autonomous Administration. Access rights are governed by legislation at the level of the autonomous communities.\nThe main criterion of the social service network is to keep the elderly in their own environment for as long as possible. The main social services are therefore aimed at maintenance in the home. There is also a residential type network. These services generally concentrate on attending the dependent elderly who live alone. The need is also recognised to help subjects with few resources.\nOrganisation and financing of home care services\nHealth care services are organised by the autonomous communities. Each community has a Health Service and draws up a Health Plan which outlines which activities are necessary in order to meet the objectives of its own Health Service. Amongst other services provided by the health services of the autonomous communities, there is primary care which includes health care in the home and care specifically for the elderly.\nHome care services are free for people who are on the minimum pension. People who have an income twice as high as the minimum pension must pay for the services whereas those on an intermediary income must pay a certain amount which is calculated on the basis of their income.\nHealth care is funded exclusively through general taxation and not through social security contributions. Home social services are financed jointly by the Ministry of Social Affairs, the regional ministries of Social Welfare and the municipalities. Home visits by general practitioners and primary care nurses are funded through the Public Health Service. In addition to government provided services, voluntary associations and not-for-profit associations such as the Red Cross also provide social home care services (Carrillo, 2005).\nKinds of home care services available\nHome care services include primary care social services, social work, assistance with household tasks, meals-on-wheels and tele-alarm services. However, these services are not available in all the autonomous communities.\nIn practice, home care services are more or less limited to household tasks (which also includes laundry and shopping). This seems to be based on the choice of the elderly people many of whom think that personal care should be carried out by the family. This opinion seems to be shared by carers who often prefer to receive formal assistance with household tasks rather than personal care (Valderrama et al., 1997 in Larizgoitia Jauregi, 2004).\nMeals-on-wheels is a services that is only available in the cities of Malaga and Cordoba Andalusia) and in the city of Lerida (in Catalonia). Teleassistance and telealarm services are offered in at least 10 of the autonomous communities. In Andalusia, Castilla-Leon, Valencia, a service exists which consists of helping to adapt the home to the needs of the dependent person.

{"text":"Mercury in the Morning\nThe planet Mercury -- the planet closest to the Sun -- is just peeking into view in the east at dawn the next few days. It looks like a fairly bright star. It's so low in the sky, though, that you need a clear horizon to spot it, and binoculars wouldn't hurt.\nMercury is a bit of a puzzle. It has a big core that's made mainly of iron, so it's quite dense. Because Mercury is so small, the core long ago should've cooled enough to form a solid ball. Yet the planet generates a weak magnetic field, hinting that the core is still at least partially molten.\nThe solution to this puzzle may involve an iron \"snow\" deep within the core.\nThe iron in the core is probably mixed with sulfur, which has a lower melting temperature than iron. Recent models suggest that the sulfur may have kept the outer part of the core from solidifying -- it's still a hot, thick liquid.\nAs this mixture cools, though, the iron \"freezes\" before the sulfur does. Small bits of solid iron fall toward the center of the planet. This creates convection currents -- like a pot of boiling water. The motion is enough to create a \"dynamo\" effect. Like a generator, it produces electrical currents, which in turn create a magnetic field around the planet.\nObservations earlier this year by the Messenger spacecraft seem to support that idea. But Messenger will provide much better readings of what's going on inside Mercury when it enters orbit around the planet in 2011.\nScript by Damond Benningfield, Copyright 2008\nFor more skywatching tips, astronomy news, and much more, read StarDate magazine.","id":"<urn:uuid:d0a1999f-a775-4afc-bcfd-ee6ff6243a0b>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/stardate.org\/radio\/program\/2008-10-20","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9436610341,"token_count":357,"score":4.0,"int_score":4}
{"text":"The CIA, the NSA, the FBI and all other three-letter, intelligence-gathering, secret-keeping agencies mimic and are modeled after secret societies. They gather and filter information by compartmentalizing the organization in a pyramid-like hierarchical structure keeping everyone but the elite on a need-to-know basis. The CIA was born from the WWII intelligence arm, the OSS (Office of Strategic Services), and was funded into permanence by the Rockefeller and Carnegie Foundations, which donated $34 million 1945-48 alone. Nearly every person instrumental in the creation of the CIA was already a member of the CFR, including the Rockefellers and Dulles brothers.\nIn 1945 when the CIA was still the OSS, they began Operation Paperclip which brought over 700 Nazi scientists directly into the forming CIA, NSA, and other high-level government organizations. Since it was illegal to even allow these Nazis into the US, let alone into top-secret government agencies, the CIA convinced the Vatican to issue American passports for these 700+ Nazi scientists under the pretense that it was to keep them out of the hands of the Russians.\n\u201cAfter WWII ended in 1945, victorious Russian and American intelligence teams began a treasure hunt throughout occupied Germany for military and scientific booty. They were looking for things like new rocket and aircraft designs, medicines, and electronics. But they were also hunting down the most precious \u2018spoils\u2019 of all: the scientists whose work had nearly won the war for Germany. The engineers and intelligence officers of the Nazi War Machine. Following the discovery of flying discs (foo-fighters), particle\/laser beam weaponry in German military bases, the War Department decided that NASA and the CIA must control this technology, and the Nazi engineers that had worked on this technology. There was only one problem: it was illegal. U.S. law explicitly prohibited Nazi officials from immigrating to America--and as many as three-quarters of the scientists in question had been committed Nazis.\u201d -Operation Paperclip Casefile: New World Order and Nazi Germany\nHundreds of Nazi mind-control specialists and doctors who performed horrific experiments on prisoners instantly had their atrocious German histories erased and were promoted into high-level American jobs. Kurt Blome, for instance, was a high-ranking Nazi scientist who experimented with plague vaccines on concentration camp prisoners. He was hired by the U.S. Army Chemical Corps to work on chemical warfare projects. Major General Walter Schreiber was a head doctor during Nazi concentration camp prisoner experiments in which they starved, and otherwise tortured the inmates. He was hired by the Air Force School of Medicine in Texas. Werner Von Braun was technical director of the Nazi Peenemunde Rocket Research Center, where the Germans developed the V2 rocket. He was hired by the U.S. Army to develop guided missiles and then made the first director of NASA!\n\u201cMilitary Intelligence \u2018cleansed\u2019 the files of Nazi references. By 1955, more than 760 German scientists had been granted citizenship in the U.S. and given prominent positions in the American scientific community. Many had been longtime members of the Nazi party and the Gestapo, had conducted experiments on humans at concentration camps, had used slave labor, and had committed other war crimes. In a 1985 expose in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Linda Hunt wrote that she had examined more than 130 reports on Project Paperclip subjects - and every one \u2018had been changed to eliminate the security threat classification.\u2019 A good example of how these dossiers were changed is the case of Werner von Braun. A September 18, 1947, report on the German rocket scientist stated, \u2018Subject is regarded as a potential security threat by the Military Governor.\u2019 The following February, a new security evaluation of Von Braun said, \u2018No derogatory information is available on the subject \u2026 It is the opinion of the Military Governor that he may not constitute a security threat to the United States.\u2019\u201d -Operation Paperclip Casefile: New World Order and Nazi Germany\nShortly after Operation Paperclip came Operation Mockingbird, during which the CIA trained reporters and created media outlets to disseminate their propaganda. One of Project Mockingbird\u2019s lead roles was played by Philip Graham who would become publisher of The Washington Post. Declassified documents admit that over 25 organizations and 400 journalists became CIA assets which now include major names like ABC, NBC, CBS, AP, Reuters, Time, Newsweek and more.\nIn 1953 the Iranian coup classified as Operation AJAX was the CIA\u2019s first successful overthrow of a foreign government. In 1951 Iran Parliament and Prime Minister Dr. Mohammed Mosaddeq voted for nationalizing their oil industry which upset western oil barons like the Rockefellers. On April 4th, 1953, CIA director Allen Dulles transferred $1 million to Iranian General Fazlollah Zahedi to be used \u201cin any way that would bring about the fall of Mosaddeq.\u201d Coup leaders first planted anti-Mosaddeq propaganda throughout the Iranian press, held demonstrations, and bribed officials. Then they began committing terror attacks to blame on Mosaddeq hoping to bring public sentiment away from their hero. They machine-gunned civilians, bombed mosques, and then passed out pamphlets saying, \u201cUp with Mosaddeq, up with Communism, down with Allah.\u201d Zahedi\u2019s coup took place between August 15th and 19th after which the CIA sent $5 million more for helping their new government consolidate power. Soon America controlled half of Iran\u2019s oil production and American weapons merchants moved in making almost $20 billion off Iran in the next 20 years.\n\u201cIn 1953 the Central Intelligence Agency working in tandem with MI6 overthrew the democratically-elected leader of Iran Dr. Mohammed Mosaddeq. Mosaddeq had been educated in the west, was pro-America, and had driven communist forces out of the north of his country shortly after being elected in 1951. Mosaddeq then nationalized the oil fields and denied British Petroleum a monopoly. The CIA\u2019s own history department at cia.gov details how U.S. and British intelligence agents carried out terror attacks and then subsequently blamed them on Mosaddeq \u2026 The provocations included propaganda, demonstrations, bribery, agents of influence, and false flag operations. They bombed the home of a prominent religious leader and blamed it on Moseddeq. They attacked mosques, machine-gunned crowds, and then handed out thousands of handbills claiming that Moseddeq had done it \u2026 Dr. Mohammed Moseddeq, who was incarcerated for the duration of his life, fared better than any of his ministers who were executed just days after the successful coup for crimes that MI6 and the CIA had committed.\u201d -Alex Jones, \u201cTerrorstorm\u201d DVD\nIn 1954 the CIA performed its second coup d\u2019etat overthrow of a foreign democracy; this time it was Guatemala, whose popular leader Jacobo Arbenz Guzman, had recently nationalized 1.5 million acres of land for the peasants. Before this, only 2.2% of Guatemala\u2019s land-owners owned 70% of the land, which included that of United Fruit Co. whose board of directors were friends with the Dulles brothers and wanted to keep Guatemala a banana republic. So once again the CIA sent in propagandists and mercenaries, trained militia groups, bombed the capital, and installed their puppet dictator Castillo Armas, who the gave United Fruit Co. and the other 2.2% land-owners everything back. Military dictators ruled Guatemala for the next 30 years killing over 100,000 citizens. Guatemalan coroners were reported saying they could not keep up with the bodies. The CIA called it Operation Success.\n\u201cThe CIA has overthrown functioning democracies in over twenty countries.\u201d -John Stockwell, former CIA official\nThey always follow the same strategy. First, globalist interests are threatened by a popular or democratically elected foreign leader; leaders who help their populations nationalize foreign-owned industries, protect workers, redistribute wealth\/land and other such actions loved by the lower and middle-class majority, hated by the super-rich minority. Next, the CIA identifies and co-operates with opposition militia groups within the country, promising them political power in trade for American business freedom. Then they are hired, trained and funded to overthrow the current administration through propaganda, rigged elections, blackmail, infiltration\/disruption of opposition parties, intimidation, torture, economic sabotage, death squads and assassinations. Eventually the CIA-backed militia group stages a coup and installs their corporate sympathizer-dictator and the former leaders are propagated as having been radicals or communists and the rest of the world is taught to shrug and view American imperialism as necessary world policing. The CIA has now evolved this whole racket into a careful science which they teach at the infamous \u201cSchool of the Americas.\u201d They also publish books like \u201cThe Freedom Fighter\u2019s Manual\u201d and \u201cThe Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual\u201d teaching methods of torture, blackmail, interrogation, propaganda and sabotage to foreign military officials.\nStarting in 1954 the CIA ran operations attempting to overthrow the communist North Vietnamese government, while supporting the Ngo Dinh Diem regime in South Vietnam. From 1957-1973 the CIA conducted what has been termed \u201cThe Secret War\u201d in Laos during which they carried out almost one coup per year in an effort to overthrow their democracy. After several unsuccessful attempts, the US began a bombing campaign, dropping more explosives and planting more landmines on Laos during this Secret War than during all of World War II. Untold thousands died and a quarter of the Laotian people became refugees often living in caves. Right up to the present, Laotians are killed\/maimed almost daily from unexploded landmines. In 1959 the US helped install \u201cPapa Doc\u201d Duvalier, the Haitian dictator whose factions killed over 100,000. In 1961 CIA Operation Mongoose attempted and failed to overthrow Fidel Castro. Also in 1961 the CIA assassinated the Dominican Republic\u2019s leader Rafael Trujillo, assassinated Zaire\u2019s democratically-elected Patrice Lumumba, and staged a coup against Ecuador\u2019s President Jose Velasco, after which US President JFK fired CIA director Allen Dulles. In 1963 the CIA was back in the Dominican Republic and Ecuador performing military coups overthrowing Juan Bosch and President Arosemana. In 1964 another CIA-funded\/armed coup overthrew Brazil\u2019s democratically-elected Joao Goulart replacing him with Dictator General Castelo Branco, CIA-trained secret police, and marauding death squads. In 1965 the CIA performed coups in Indonesia and Zaire and installed oppressive military dictators; General Suharto in Indonesia would then go on to slaughter nearly a million of his countrymen. In 1967 a CIA-backed coup overthrew the government of Greece. In 1968 they helped capture Che Guevara in Bolivia. In 1970 they overthrew Cambodia\u2019s popular Prince Sahounek, an action that greatly strengthened the once minor opposition Khmer Rouge party who went on to murder millions. In 1971 they backed a coup in Bolivia and installed Dictator Hugo Banzer who went on torture and murder over 2000 of his political opponents. In 1973 they assassinated Chile\u2019s democratically-elected Salvador Allende and replaced him with General Augusto Pinochet who murdered thousands of his civilians. On and on it goes; The Association for Responsible Dissent put out a report estimating that by 1987, 6 million people worldwide had died resulting from CIA covert ops. Since then there have been many untold millions more.\n\u201cThroughout the world, on any given day, a man, woman or child is likely to be displaced, tortured, killed or disappeared, at the hands of governments or armed political groups. More often than not, the United States shares the blame.\u201d -Amnesty International annual report on U.S. Military aid and human rights, 1996\n1979-1989 CIA Operation Cyclone, with joint funding from Britain\u2019s MI6, heavily armed and trained over 100,000 Afghani Mujahideen (\u201choly warriors\u201d) during the Soviet war in Afghanistan. With the help of the Pakistani ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence), billions of dollars were given to create this Islamic army. Selig Harrison from the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars stated, \u201cThe CIA made a historic mistake in encouraging Islamic groups from all over the world to come to Afghanistan. The US provided $3 billion [now many more billion] for building up these Islamic groups, and it accepted Pakistan\u2019s demand that they should decide how this money should be spent \u2026 Today that money and those weapons have helped build up the Taliban \u2026 [who] are now making a living out of terrorism.\u201d\n\u201cThe United States has been part and parcel to supporting the Taliban all along, and still is let me add \u2026 You have a military government in Pakistan now that is arming the Taliban to the teeth \u2026 Let me note; that [US] aid has always gone to Taliban areas \u2026 And when people from the outside try to put aid into areas not controlled by the Taliban, they are thwarted by our own State Department \u2026 Pakistan [has] initiated a major resupply effort, which eventually saw the defeat, and caused the defeat, of almost all of the anti-Taliban forces in Afghanistan.\u201d -Congressional Rep. Dana Rohrbacher, the House International Relations Committee on Global Terrorism and South Asia, 2000\nBritish Foreign Secretary Robin Cook stated before the House of Commons that \u201cAl Qaeda\u201d is not actually a terrorist group, but a database of international Mujahadden and arms dealers\/smugglers used by the CIA to funnel arms, money, and guerrillas. The word \u201cAl Qaeda\u201d itself literally translates to \u201cthe database.\u201d Not only did the CIA create the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, they continued funding them right up to the 9\/11 attacks blamed on them. For example, four months prior to 9\/11, in May, 2001, Colin Powell gave another $43 million in aid to the Taliban.\n\u201cNot even the corporate US media could whitewash these facts and so explained it away by alleging that US officials had sought cooperation from Pakistan because it was the original backer of the Taliban, the hard-line Islamic leadership of Afghanistan accused by Washington of harboring Bin Laden. Then the so called \u2018missing link\u2019 came when it was revealed that the head of the ISI was the principal financier of the 9\/11 hijackers ... Pakistan and the ISI is the go between of the global terror explosion. Pakistan's military-intelligence apparatus, which literally created and sponsored the Taliban and Al Qaeda, is directly upheld and funded by the CIA. These facts are not even in dispute, neither in the media nor in government. Therefore when we are told by the neocon heads of the new world order that they are doing everything in their power to dismantle the global terror network what we are hearing is the exact opposite of the truth. They assembled it, they sponsored it and they continue to fund it. As any good criminal should, they have a middleman to provide plausible deniability, that middleman is the ISI and the military dictatorship of Pakistan.\u201d -Steve Watson, \u201cU.S. Intel Officer: Al Qaeda Leadership Allowed to Operate Freely\u201d (http:\/\/www.infowars.net\/articles\/july2007\/160707ISI.htm)\nIn a late 1980\u2019s Newsweek article, outspoken opponent of President Bush and recently assassinated Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, told George Bush Sr., \u201cyou are creating a Frankenstein,\u201d concerning the growing Islamist movement. She also came out in 2007 to say that Osama Bin Laden was already long dead having been murdered by Omar Sheikh. She was murdered herself a month after the interview, only two weeks before the Pakistani 2008 general elections.","id":"<urn:uuid:96c4ba0b-5575-4365-9b5c-1164b7bca6d5>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.atlanteanconspiracy.com\/2008\/09\/history-of-cia.html?showComment=1358287968011","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9628726244,"token_count":3320,"score":2.859375,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Here are the basics about the Boy Scouts of America:\nBoy Scouts of America or BSA\nFounded on 8 February 1910, in Washington, DC, by Chicago publisher William Boyce\nChartered by the US Congress in 1916 (a few other youth programs have congressional charters, including the Civil Air Patrol , Girl Scouts of the USA , the Boys & Girls Clubs of America , Future Farmers of America [??], and 4-H [??])\nHeadquarters in Irving, Texas (near Dallas)\nThe BSA is the USA's only Boy Scouting organization recognized by the World Organization of the Scout Movement (many countries have several Scouting programs).\nThe BSA actually provides the Scouting program to three countries: the US plus the Pacific island nations of the Marshall Islands and Micronesia, which are served by Hawaii's Aloha Council.\nThe BSA is divided into about 300 local Councils.\nThe BSA and its local Councils employ about 4000 full-time professional staff.\nThe BSA is the second largest Scouting organization in the world (the largest is Indonesia).\nTotal membership (from a March 2011 Fact Sheet on the BSA website, although its information varies slightly from other numbers on the BSA website) (12\/31\/2010) was 3 630 779 (2 588 326 youth and 1 042 453 adults). This does not include membership in the school-based Learning for Life subsidiary of the BSA, but does count 666 Lone Scouts and 43 310 adult Council Scouters.\nThe BSA has four program divisions, three traditional Scouting programs based on grade or age, plus a fourth classroom-based non-traditional subsidiary:\nCub Scouting Division (boys, grades 1 through 5)\nMembers in grade 1 are called Tiger Cubs.\nMembers in grades 2 and 3 are called Cub Scouts, and work on Wolf rank (grade 2) or Bear rank (grade 3).\nMembers in grades 4 and 5 are called Webelos Scouts, and work on the Webelos rank and the Arrow of Light rank.\nWebelos Scouts usually graduate into Boy Scouting in about February of grade 5.\nThe overall Cub Scouting program is family-centered, adult-run, and offers very little camping or outdoor activities.\nAdult leaders can be male or female, over age 21 (age 18-20 for certain assistant positions). The leader of the pack is the Cubmaster, and each den is led by an adult Den Leader.\nThe only boy leadership position is Denner, rotated monthly among the den members, which consists mostly of helping the Den Leader and making a den report at the monthly pack meeting.\nAs of 12\/31\/2010, Cub Scout youth membership included 226 211 Tiger Cubs, 707 868 Cub Scouts, and 573 522 Webelos Scouts, for a total of 1 507 601, a one-year loss of 7.8%. There are 47 259 packs, with an average size of 32 youth members. And there are 421 405 adult Cub Scout leaders.\nBoy Scouting Division (boys, age about 10-1\/2 until 18)\nTwo programs\u2014Boy Scouting and Varsity Scouting\nBoy Scouting is traditional Scouting for boys age approximately 10-1\/2 until 18.\nIn addition to the general camping program for all Scouts, older Scouts in a troop can form a Venture patrol to do high adventure activities. Note that the troop's Venture patrol and Venturing (see below) are completely separate and unrelated programs, despite the confusingly similar names.\nBoy Scouts work on 6 ranks: Tenderfoot, Second Class, First Class, Star, Life, Eagle. Eagle Scouts can also earn Eagle Palms, but these are not ranks.\nThe overall Boy Scouting program is mostly boy-run with adults providing guidance and training, and is strongly oriented toward a camping and outdoor program.\nAt about age 14, a Boy Scout can choose to remain in the troop, or transfer to a Varsity team, or transfer to a Venturing crew.\nAdult troop leaders can be male or female, over age 21 (age 18-20 for Assistant Scoutmasters). The adult leader of the troop is the Scoutmaster.\nThe boy leader of the troop is the elected Senior Patrol Leader, and each patrol is led by an elected boy Patrol Leader.\nAs of 12\/31\/2010, Boy Scouting membership included 792 202 youth members and 493 852 adult leaders. There are 40 099 troops, with an average size of 20 youth members.\nVarsity Scouting is a separate, optional, non-coed, and little-used program for boys age 14 until 18 (mostly used by the LDS\/Mormon church).\nVarsity Scouts wear the same uniform as Boy Scouts (with slightly different insignia), and work on the same ranks.\nVarsity Scouts typically camp like Boy Scouts, and often compete in team sports.\nAdult team leaders can be male or female, over age 21 (age 18-20 for Assistant Coaches). The adult leader of the team is the Coach.\nThe boy leader of the team is the elected Team Captain, and each squad is led by an elected squad leader.\nAs of 12\/31\/2010, Varsity Scouting membership included 59 863 youth members and 22 806 adult leaders. There are 8539 teams, with an average size of only 7 youth members.\nAs of 12\/31\/2010, overall youth membership in the Boy Scouting Division (Boy Scouts + Varsity Scouts) totaled 852 065, a one-year loss of 5.1%.\nSea Scouting (formerly Sea Exploring) is part of the Venturing program.\nThe former career-awareness Exporing program is now part of Learning for Life.\nMale Venturers can work on the same ranks as Boy Scouts (technically, they must earn the ranks through First Class as a member of a Boy Scout troop). In addition, all Venturers have their own advancement system, culminating with the Venturing Silver Award. And Sea Scouts have an additional advancement program, culminating with the Quartermaster award.\nBSA's Venturing Division is unusual compared to the equivalent programs in most other countries because high-school-aged young men have the option of being a Venturer, or they can remain in a Scout troop or join a Varsity team.\nThere is no BSA program equivalent to the Rover programs available in some countries (for those over age 21).\nAdult leaders can be male or female, over age 21 (age 18-20 for associate Advisors). The adult leader is called the Venturing Advisor.\nThe key youth leader of a Venturing crew is the elected crew President.\nAs of 12\/31\/2010, Venturing youth membership totaled 227 994, a one-year loss of 11.4%. There are 18 856 crews, with an average size of 12 youth members. Female youth membership is 31% of the total. And there are 61 080 adult Venturing leaders.\nTwo programs\u2014Learning for Life (school-based programs) and Exploring (work-site-based program)\nLearning for Life is a non-traditional, coed, classroom-based character education program, with programs set up by grade:\nSeekers (K-grade 2)\nDiscoverers (grades 3 and 4)\nChallengers (grades 5 and 6)\nChampions (special needs)\nBuilders (grades 7 and 8)\nNavigators (high school)\nLFL members are not required to adhere to the Scout Oath or Law, and membership is open to any youth subject to the age restrictions.\nExploring is the branch of Learning for Life that focuses on workplace-based and career-oriented interests for high-school-aged youth. Note that what was for many years called \"Exploring\" is now generally covered in the Venturing program.\nGoal is to help young people develop skills, positive attitudes, values, and career awareness.\nLearning for Life apparently no longer reports its membership numbers.\nProvides special leadership and emphasis to urban and rural Scouting programs in the Cub Scouting, Boy Scouting, and Venturing divisions\nMajor focus on minority involvement in Scouting, with specific focuses on African Americans, Hispanic Americans\/Latinos, and Asian Americans\nNames and Numbers\nWhile the Girl Scouts of the USA call all their units troops, the BSA identifies its units by the program they conduct:\nCub Scouts belong to a pack, which is divided into several dens (at least one Tiger den, Wolf den, Bear den, first-year Webelos den, and second-year Webelos den). Webelos dens may also choose to call themselves patrols and adopt a patrol name instead of a den number.\nBoy Scouts belong to a troop, which is divided into several patrols.\nVarsity Scouts belong to a team, which is divided into several squads.\nVenturers belong to a crew, and Sea Scouts belong to a ship.\nLearning for Life participants belong to a group.\nUnit identification (pack, troop, etc) is more confusing in the US than in most countries. Outside the US, units usually are part of a Scouting \"group\". Each group would include one or more program \"sections\" such as a pack, a troop, and a crew. The group would have a number associated with its town or area (such as the 2nd Brixton Scout Group), and often all group members wear a common neckerchief. In the US, which doesn't use the \"group\" concept, each pack, troop, etc, is separately numbered, and there is no link to the unit's location. For example, in our town, there is a Pack 97 and a Troop 97, which are unrelated and meet at separate locations. And, since unit numbers are repeated in each of the 300+ local Scout Councils, there could be 300 (or more) Troop 97's in the US. Actually, due to the many Scout Council mergers over the past 25 years (there used to be over 500 Councils), some Councils (like ours) could have two Troop 97's.","id":"<urn:uuid:40b0b62c-dcd6-47ed-a305-5fc63a58bb36>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/troop97.net\/bsainfo.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9503284097,"token_count":2082,"score":2.65625,"int_score":3}

{"text":"KIKUYU CULTURE & TRADITIONS\n|Kenya is famous for its 42 cultures, but other than the nomadic Maasai and Samburu, not many of these are widely known to the outside world. A new cultural centre devoted to the Kikuyu, Kenya\u2019s largest offers a unique experience of this tradition rich culture existing in a modern world.|\nRiuki Cultural Centre is located not far outside of Nairobi, in the Kikuyu Heartland of Kiambu. The centre is run by Dr. Kinuthia Njoroge, who wanted to build a traditional Kikuyu village homestead to show local children the history and customs of their community.\nThe Kikuyu are the largest community in Kenya, and have always played a central role in the development of the independent Nation. For this reason, many may believe that modern influence has eroded the traditional way of life for this community, who mainly live around the capital city and the highlands.\nBut as Riuki demonstrates, this is not the case. While the traditional huts and ceremonies may be displays of a proud history, many of the same beliefs and customs persist in modern life.\nIn cuisine, music, marriage and everyday family life, most Kenyan Kikuyus still hold true to their identity. It is this pride that Riuki strives to encourage and strengthen, with its own blend of the modern and traditional.\nNow visitors to Kenya can come to Riuki and spend a day learning more about this little known culture.\nWelcomed to the centre by a group of elders, all of whom live in the local area, guests are welcomed in true Kikuyu style, with an invitation to drink from a horn filled with Muratina, a locally brewed drink.\nThere is a tour of a traditionally built hut with an explanation of how the traditional society operated. Communities always remained bound by strict and strong ties of clan loyalty and an even stronger sense of tribal unity - There was an age set system among young men, known as Mariika, but all clans and villages (itura) always paid deference to the wisdom and law of the tribe.\nAt Riuki, traditional songs, proverbs and dances bring the myths and legends of the Kikuyu to life.\nAccording to Kikuyu mythology, all of creation began at the summit of Mount Kenya.\nThe icy peak was the realm of Ngai, the Supreme Creator, who descended from the heavens to his mountainous throne to survey his newly created lands. The mountain became Kirinyaga, his resting place, and it was from here that he called forth Gikuyu, the father of the Kikuyu people.\nNgai told him that all of the lands around Kirinyaga would be the home of Gikuyu and his children forever. He sent Gikuyu to grove of Fig trees, where he found a woman called Mumbi. This grove would become known as Mukuru wa Nyagathanga, the birthplace of all Kikuyu, still revered as a sacred place.\nAmong the fig trees, Gikuyu and Mumbi produced nine daughters- Wanjiku, Wanjiru, Wanjeri, Wambui, Wangari, Wacera, Waithera, Wairimu, and Nyambura. (Traditionally all Kikuyu girls should be given one of these names)\nThe girls grew into beautiful young women, who each full moon wandered the lands around Kirinyaga in search of men so that they could bear children. They begged their father to appeal to Ngai for help. Finally he bowed before the Mountain, and Ngai commanded him to make sacrifice among the figs and light a fire.\nThe sacrifice of a goat beneath a fig tree is still considered a way to call rain in times of drought, but in this first case it was a different form of life sustaining rain that Gikuyu sought. After the sacrifice he plunged nine sticks into a fire, and prayed. The fire erupted into an inferno, from which nine strong young men emerged. Giving thanks, Gikuyu took them back to his daughters, and the nine marriages were blessed by Ngai.\nEach of the daughters made her own homestead, and nine separate clans of the Kikuyu were born. the unity of these clans was known as the Nyumba ya Mumbi, in honour of their Mother. The peak of Kirinyaga has since remained the sacred home of Ngai. As at Riuki, all Kikuyu homesteads were traditionally built to face this Holy Mountain.\nA group of local women come to the centre to perform for visitors, with a series of dances traditionally performed at weddings and initiations and to sing songs.

While colony losses are not unexpected during winter weather, the magnitude of loss suffered by some beekeepers was highly unusual.\nThis phenomenon, which currently does not have a recognizable underlying cause, has been termed \"Colony Collapse Disorder\" (CCD). The main symptom of CCD is simply no or a low number of adult honey bees present but with a live queen and no dead honey bees in the hive. Often there is still honey in the hive, and immature bees (brood) are present.\nARS scientists and others are in the process of carrying out research to discover the cause(s) of CCD and develop ways for beekeepers to respond to the problem.\nWhy should the public care about honey bees?\nBee pollination is responsible for $15 billion in added crop value, particularly for specialty crops such as almonds and other nuts, berries, fruits, and vegetables. About one mouthful in three in the diet directly or indirectly benefits from honey bee pollination. While there are native pollinators (honey bees came from the Old World with European colonists), honey bees are more prolific and the easiest to manage for the large scale pollination that U.S. agriculture requires. In California, the almond crop alone uses 1.3 million colonies of bees, approximately one half of all honey bees in the United States, and this need is projected to grow to 1.5 million colonies by 2010.\nThe number of managed honey bee colonies has dropped from 5 million in the1940s to only 2.5 million today. At the same time, the call for hives to supply pollination service has continued to climb. This means honey bee colonies are trucked farther and more often than ever before.\nHoney bee colony health has also been declining since the 1980s with the advent of new pathogens and pests. The spread into the United States of varroa and tracheal mites, in particular, created major new stresses on honey bees.\nIs there currently a crisis in food production because of CCD?\nWhile CCD has created a very serious problem for beekeepers and could threaten the pollination industry if it becomes more widespread, fortunately there were enough bees to supply all the needed pollination this past spring. But we cannot wait to see if CCD becomes an agricultural crisis to do the needed research into the cause and treatment for CCD.\nThe cost of hives for pollination has risen this year. But much of that is due to growing demand. Some of the price increase may also be due to higher cost of gas and diesel and other increases related to energy and labor costs. Commercial beekeepers truck hives long distances to provide pollination services, so in particular they must deal with rising expenses.\nVarroa mites (one is visible on the back of this bee) are a major threat to honey bee health and are becoming resistant to two compounds (coumaphos and fluvalinate) used to control them. Beekeepers now have a simple assay to determine whether mites are resistant and thus ensure use of appropriate control measures. Click the image for more information about it.\nAre there any theories about what may be causing CCD?\nCase studies and questionnaires related to management practices and environmental factors have identified a few common factors shared by those beekeepers experiencing CCD, but no common environmental agents or chemicals stand out as causative. There are three major possibilities that are being looked into by researchers.\nPesticides may be having unexpected negative effects on honey bees.\nA new parasite or pathogen may be attacking honey bees. One possible candidate being looked at is a pathogenic gut microbe called Nosema. Viruses are also suspected.\nA perfect storm of existing stresses may have unexpectedly weakened colonies leading to collapse. Stress, in general, compromises the immune system of bees (and other social insects) and may disrupt their social system, making colonies more susceptible to disease.\nThese stresses could include high levels of infection by the varroa mite (a parasite that feeds on bee blood and transmits bee viruses); poor nutrition due to apiary overcrowding, pollination of crops with low nutritional value, or pollen or nectar scarcity; and exposure to limited or contaminated water supplies. Migratory stress brought about by increased needs for pollination might also be a contributing factor.\nHas CCD ever happened before?\nThe scientific literature has several mentions of honey bee disappearances\u00f3in the 1880s, the 1920s and the 1960s. While the descriptions sound similar to CCD, there is no way to know for sure if the problems were caused by the same agents as today's CCD.\nThere have also been unusual colony losses before. In 1903, in the Cache Valley in Utah, 2000 colonies were lost to an unknown \"disappearing disease\" after a \"hard winter and a cold spring.\" More recently, in 1995-96, Pennsylvania beekeepers lost 53 percent of their colonies without a specific identifiable cause.\nWhat about cell phones\u00f3do they have anything to do with CCD?\nThe short answer is no.\nThere was a very small study done in Germany that looked at whether a particular type of base station for cordless phones could affect honey bee homing systems. But, despite all the attention that this study has received, it has nothing to do with CCD. Stefan Kimmel, the researcher who conducted the study and wrote the paper, recently e-mailed The Associated Press to say that there is \"no link between our tiny little study and the CCD-phenomenon ... anything else said or written is a lie.\"\nNewly emerged honey bee, Apis mellifera, the subject of genome sequencing work aimed at improving bee traits and management. Click the image for more information about it.\nWhat is ARS doing about CCD?\nIn April 2007, ARS held a Colony Collapse Disorder Research Workshop that brought together over 80 of the major bee scientists, industry representatives, extension agents, and others to discuss a research agenda. They identified areas where more information is needed and the highest-priority needs for additional research projects related to CCD.\nA CCD Steering Committee, led by ARS and USDA's Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, developed a Research Action Plan to coordinate a comprehensive response for discovering what factors may be causing CCD and what actions need to be taken.\nOne of the tools that will help in this research is the recently sequenced honey bee genome to better understand bees' basic biology and breed better bees, and to better diagnose bee pests and pathogens and their impacts on bee health and colony collapse. The use of this genome information certainly will have great applications in improving honey bee breeding and management.\nThe search for factors that are involved in CCD is focusing on four areas: pathogens, parasites, environmental stresses, and bee management stresses such as poor nutrition. It is unlikely that a single factor is the cause of CCD; it is more likely that there is a complex of different components.\nIn September 2007, a research team that included ARS published the results of an intensive genetic screening of CCD-affected honey bee colonies and non-CCD-affected hives.\nThe only pathogen found in almost all samples from honey bee colonies with CCD, but not in non-CCD colonies, was the Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV), a dicistrovirus that can be transmitted by the varroa mite. It was found in 96.1 percent of the CCD-bee samples.\nThis research does not identify IAPV as the cause of CCD. What this research found was strictly a strong correlation of the appearance of IAPV and CCD together. No cause-and-effect connection can be inferred from the genetic screening data. (More information about this study)\nHoney bees devour a new, nutrient-rich food developed by ARS researchers. Click the image for more information about it.\nThis was the first report of IAPV in the United States. IAPV was initially identified in honey bee colonies in Israel in 2002, where the honey bees exhibited unusual behavior, such as twitching wings outside the hive and a loss of worker bee populations.\nThe study also found IAPV in honey bees from Australia that had been imported into the United States, as well as in royal jelly imported from China. Australian bees began to be imported from Australia into the United States in 2005. Questions were raised about a connection between those imported bees and the appearance of IAPV in the United States. Beekeepers sought out Australian imports of bees as a way to replenish their hive populations.\nTo determine whether IAPV has been present in the United States since before the importation of honey bees from Australia, a follow up detailed genetic screening of several hundred honey bees that had been collected between 2002 and 2007 from colonies in Maryland, Pennsylvania, California and Israel was conducted by ARS researchers.\nThe results of the follow study showed IAPV has been in this country since at least 2002, which challenges the idea that IAPV is a recent introduction from Australia. (More information about this study)\nThis study in no way rules IAPV out as a factor in CCD. Research by several groups will now focus on understanding differences in virulence across strains of IAPV and on interactions with other stress factors. Even if IAPV proves to be a cause of CCD, there still may also be other contributing factors-which researchers are pursuing.\nWhat should beekeepers do now about CCD?\nSince little is known about the cause(s) of CCD right now, mitigation must be based on improving general honey bee health and habitat and countering known mortality factors by using best management practices.\nWhat can I as a member of the public do to help honey bees?\nThe best action you can take to benefit honey bees is to not use pesticides indiscriminately, especially not to use pesticides at mid-day when honey bees are most likely to be out foraging for nectar.\nIn addition, you can plant and encourage the planting of good nectar sources such as red clover, foxglove, bee balm, and joe-pye weed.

{"text":"Second of two parts.\nIn the previous column, we toured the present-day East Cemetery on the Old Post Road. But in looking at its origin in 1830 by a town body called the First Located School Society, we found ourselves wandering back to 17th-century England, when the king granted his Connecticut colony a hefty slice of North America.\nWe then jumped ahead a century to see Connecticut give almost all of it away to cancel Revolutionary War debts and settle a shooting war with Pennsylvania. Connecticut's consolation prize was an isolated fragment of its former colonial real estate holdings, more than five hundred miles west of Hartford.\nYou've probably heard of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, but you probably didn't know that it's named after the above-noted remnant of Connecticut's legacy from Charles II, which became known as the Western Reserve. Three million acres all told, it extended south to the 41st parallel from the shores of Lake Erie and west from the newly drawn western border of Pennsylvania. You know it today as northern Ohio.\nYep, Connecticut lost a bunch of land but still owned a big piece of Ohio. Impressive! But what about the First Located School Society and the East Cemetery? Bear with me.\nAfter the Revolutionary War, a few Connecticut settlers tried to make a go of it in the Western Reserve, but severe weather, lack of supply and agricultural routes, and less-than-welcoming Indians made things very difficult. Connecticut, perhaps for lack of a better idea for the Western Reserve, decided to sell it. In 1795, a group of private investors picked it up for $1.2 million, or about 40 cents an acre. The investors sent a guy named Moses Cleaveland to survey the area, and he got to have the city, with a slight spelling change, named after him. Connecticut relinquished its legal authority over the Western Reserve a few years later, and it was absorbed into the Northwest Territory. Hey, we could have owned Cleveland!\nThis is where the First Located School Society comes in. But first, let me explain why there's one county and several townships in Ohio named after Fairfield.\nAs the 19th century approached, the Indian threat passed, and supply routes improved. More and more Connecticut families emigrated to the Western Reserve to get cheap, fertile land and live alongside like-minded New Englanders. The settlers naturally named their new towns after their old ones, so Fairfield and other Connecticut towns are well represented in Ohio. The westernmost 500,000 acres of the Western Reserve, known as the Firelands, had long ago been set aside for residents of eight Connecticut towns, including Fairfield, who suffered the loss of their homes to the British in the Revolutionary War. Affected families were to receive individual land grants, but bureaucracy, Indians, and the War of 1812 killed the well-intentioned project.\nFinally, we can finish the story of the East Cemetery. What did Connecticut do with that $1.2 million windfall from the 1795 sale of the Western Reserve? The legislature nobly created a Perpetual School Fund, to be administered by the towns through civil authorities called school societies, now extinct as public education evolved.\nThe inaugural meeting of the First Located School Society of Fairfield took place on Oct. 27, 1796, \"In order to form and Organize themselves in a School Society according to one Statute Law of this State.\" The Society immediately laid out six school districts. Here is how the first district was described, exactly as recorded in the original record book:\n\"Voted and Agreed that the first District for a School in this Society -- to begin at Black Rock a little Easterly of John Wheeler's house, and to run Northwardly of David Wheeler's house -- and from thence to run down to the River Eastward to Grovers hill point -- and from thence running up the Harbour as far as to the place first Set out, -- all the Inhabitants contained within said Limits to be one District for a School in said Society, and to be called by the name of the Black Rock District.\"\nFive more districts were similarly defined, with boundaries that worked well for 1796 Fairfielders, but might be a little shaky these days.\nIn 1830, in concert with other Connecticut school societies, the First Located School Society took on the task of establishing a burial ground, for the \"better accommodation of the Inhabitants ...\" It seems that this was an obligation legislated by the state, but why cemeteries would fall to the school societies is a mystery.\nA committee identified a plot of land in the center of town owned by Mrs. Sarah Taylor, bought it for $600, dubbed it the East Cemetery, and launched itself into the cemetery business. Business must have been good. Within the year, the School Society opened the West Cemetery on the Post Road, complete with sections for \"Strangers\" and \"Colored People.\"\nSo, it all comes together: King Charles II made Connecticut a very big North American landholder. But then, Revolutionary War debt and the Yankee-Pennamite Wars took most of it away but begat the Western Reserve, which begat the Perpetual School Fund, which begat the First Located School Society of Fairfield, which begat the East Cemetery on the Old Post Road.\nRon Blumenfeld is a Fairfield writer and retired pediatrician.

{"text":"The onset of the disease\n- Drinking alcohol\n- Public transport\n- Personal finances\n- Handling money\n- Going out alone\nIt is best to consider as soon as possible how you are going to deal with certain matters relating to the person\u2019s independence. Matters relating to their personal liberty such as whether it is safe for them to drive, go out alone, drink alcohol or smoke have to be dealt with. Financial matters also have to be considered, e.g. should they be able to write out cheques and make financial decisions? These and similar questions should be discussed with the person with dementia at an early stage when they are still able to play a role in decision making. When you are trying to decide how to handle the above-mentioned situations, you will probably find yourself split between trying to leave the person with dementia with as much independence as possible and at the same time trying to protect them from possible risks and dangers. The following guidelines may help you in making your decisions.\nIn the early stages some people who have been diagnosed as having Alzheimer\u2019s disease can still drive safely, but as the disease progresses the ability to drive will almost certainly deteriorate. The person may start to find it difficult to find familiar places, fail to observe road signs and respect rules of the road, drive too fast or too slow, have slow reactions and become confused, frustrated or angry while driving. However, people with dementia are often extremely reluctant to give up the right to drive, as it is one of the last signs of their independence and adulthood. It can therefore be difficult to convince them of the necessity to stop driving. But, it is too dangerous an issue not to be dealt with straight away.\nYou should first try to discuss the issue of driving with the person with dementia, pointing out the possible dangers of driving, as well as the benefits of not having to. They may feel angry and depressed about the loss and need support during this awkward period. It might soften the blow if you were to arrange for other forms of transport or for other people to drive the person around. However, persuasion does not always work and some carers have tremendous difficulties trying to stop the person with dementia from driving. If this is the case, you might find that the person is more willing to listen to a doctor, the police or someone in authority. If this is also unsuccessful, you may have to try to prevent them from driving. You could, for example, hide the car keys, arrange for the car not to work (e.g. by removing the distributor cap) or park the car further down the street out of sight. If it is not needed, you could even sell the car and the money saved would help pay for other means of transport. One carer overcame this problem by leaving the car out ready to drive without the ignition key. Her husband sat in it and happily \u201cdrove\u201d for hours changing gears and signalling without actually moving. Whatever you decide to do, you should inform the insurance company about the diagnosis of dementia.\nCare should be taken not to let the person with dementia smoke alone as it is a fire hazard. Also, some people with dementia might forget that they are holding a cigarette and it could burn their fingers. You should try to persuade the person to cut down on smoking and preferably stop. People with dementia often forget to smoke and then don\u2019t miss cigarettes once the habit has been broken. However, if they continue smoking, there are a few useful precautions to take, e.g. put large ashtrays everywhere, replace wastepaper baskets with metal bins, buy flame resistant clothes and furniture, fit smoke alarms and keep matches out of reach. Smoking alone, particularly in bed, is the biggest risk. You might have more success persuading the person with dementia to restrict their smoking to times when there is company, rather than trying to prevent it altogether. It is important to pay particular attention not to let the person smoke if they are using nicotine patches as this greatly increases health risks.\nAlcoholic drinks may increase confusion in the person with dementia. Although the occasional social drink should not cause particular concern, it is best to ask your doctor\u2019s advice about whether the person with dementia should have access to alcoholic drinks. This is particularly important if they are under medication. Even if the doctor agrees to the person having an occasional drink, you will still need to make sure that they do not have more. Loss of memory may result in the person with dementia forgetting that they have already had a few drinks. It is best to keep alcohol in a locked cupboard or hidden away.\nEarly on in the disease, the person with dementia might be able to use public transport. But as the disease progresses they may start to have difficulties remembering where they are going, paying the fare, getting the right bus or train, getting out at the right place, etc. When this happens the person could feel embarrassed and afraid, particularly if they cannot remember where they are going or where they live. For this reason, in the later stages it would be preferable to try to arrange private transport. You could perhaps make a plan in advance of different people who are willing to drive the person around.\nAdministrative formalities and personal finances\nThe person with dementia might also have financial obligations or assets of little or considerable importance. It is necessary to discuss financial matters early on so that the person with dementia can make decisions while they are still able, appoint someone to handle their financial matters when they are no longer able and make a will. If you are handling the person\u2019s finances, keep them separate from your own and keep a record of what you spend and receive in case you are asked to account for it at some stage. The person with dementia might forget what was decided however many times you might explain it. You might also find it necessary to help the person with dementia to deal with administrative formalities, e.g. collecting benefits, filling out forms, etc. There are a few possibilities for handling this such as an Enduring Power of Attorney. Your Alzheimer\u2019s organisation will be able to give your more details.\nAs the disease progresses the person with dementia will become less able to defend their own interests. It is possible to appoint a guardian to protect their interests and make decisions on their behalf (e.g. on where to live, health issues, etc.). This would help in situations where the person with dementia did not or was unable to take the decision at an earlier stage.\nPeople with dementia tend to experience difficulties handling money even fairly early on in the disease. Due to a loss of memory and understanding of the symbolic function of money, they may pay for something more than once, not pay at all, give money away or lose it. In this way problems can accumulate without you necessarily realising. In order to maintain their sense of wellbeing and self-esteem, you might be able to arrange for the person with dementia to carry on paying for goods and services (whilst ensuring that the risk of mistake or being taken advantage of is minimised) and ensure that they always have some money on them. Some carers have found that certain shopkeepers and hairdressers are willing to take cheques from the person with dementia, which are no longer valid, but which are then replaced by the carer. Sometimes, local shopkeepers who are understanding will let you pay later for articles which the person with dementia takes out of the shop without paying. Payment of regular accounts (e.g. electricity, gas telephone, etc.) can be settled by arranging direct debits with your bank.\nGoing out alone\nYou may be worried about the person with dementia going out alone for various reasons, e.g. traffic, the risk of getting lost or robbed etc. However, they might object to being accompanied everywhere, seeing this as an invasion of their privacy. You will therefore need to be extremely tactful in trying to keep an eye on their whereabouts.

{"text":"Air pollution health alert and advisory issued through Wednesday, March 10\nThe Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) has issued an air pollution health ALERT for today and tomorrow, March 8 and 9 and an air pollution health ADVISORY for Wednesday, March 10 for the Twin Cities and Rochester area. The Air Quality Index values (AQI) in the Twin Cities exceeds the level considered unhealthy for sensitive groups.\nDense fog overnight, which aids in fine particle production, and calm winds, have allowed fine particle concentrations to build to levels considered unhealthy for sensitive groups. Fine particle levels are expected to gradually fall this afternoon as the fog dissipates. However, calm winds and high relative humidity will continue to trap pollutants, keeping air quality conditions unhealthy for sensitive groups. Weather conditions are supposed to improve the air quality to good AQI levels by Thursday, March 11.\nThose who have respiratory or cardiovascular problems, young children, the elderly, and individuals whom are physically active are considered especially sensitive to elevated levels of air pollution. Be prepared to postpone or reduce vigorous activity. Ozone and fine particles can be drawn deeply into the lungs, so reduce activities that lead to deep or accelerated breathing. Even individuals that are otherwise healthy may experience health effects when air pollutant levels increase.\nHow you can help:\nResidents can take simple steps to help reduce emissions that create smog. Motor vehicle emissions contribute to fine particle pollution. To lower levels of air pollution, the MPCA is urging residents to use alternate modes of transportation such as mass transit, car pools, biking and walking to work or shop.\nOther measures that will help reduce emissions on days when the Index reaches 100 and above include:\n1.

{"text":"By JOHN CARTER\nWhen Abraham Lincoln died from an assassin\u2019s bullet on April 15, 1865, Edwin Stanton remarked to those gathered around his bedside, \u201cNow he belongs to the ages.\u201d\nOne of the meanings implied in Stanton\u2019s famous statement is that Lincoln would not only be remembered as an iconic figure of the past, but that his spirit would also play a significant role in ages to come.\nThe Oscar-nominated movie \u201cLincoln,\u201d which chronicles the struggle to pass the 13th amendment abolishing slavery, has turned our attention again to Lincoln\u2019s legacy and his relevance amid our nation\u2019s present divisions and growing pains.\nHere is some of the wit and wisdom of Abraham Lincoln worth pondering:\n\u201cAs for being president, I feel like the man who was tarred and feathered and ridden out of town on a rail. To the man who asked him how he liked it, he said, \u2018If it wasn\u2019t for the honor of the thing, I\u2019d rather walk.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cI desire so to conduct the affairs of this administration that if at the end, when I come to lay down the reins of power, I have lost every other friend on earth, I shall at least have one friend left, and that friend shall be down inside of me.\u201d\n\u201cShould my administration prove to be a very wicked one, or what is more probable, a very foolish one, if you the people are true to yourselves and the Constitution, there is but little harm I can do, thank God.\u201d\n\u201cBad promises are better broken than kept.\u201d\n\u201cI am not at all concerned that the Lord is on our side in this great struggle, for I know that the Lord is always on the side of the right; but it is my constant anxiety and prayer that I and this nation may be on the Lord\u2019s side.\u201d\n\u201cI have never had a feeling, politically, that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence.\u201d\n\u201cThose who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves; and, under a just God, cannot long retain it.\u201d\n\u201cAs I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. This expresses my idea of democracy.\u201d\n\u201cThe probability that we may fail in the struggle ought not to deter us from the support of a cause we believe to be just.\u201d\n\u201cThe true rule, in determining to embrace or reject anything, is not whether it have any evil in it, but whether it have more evil than good. There are few things wholly evil or wholly good.\u201d\n\u201cSome of our generals complain that I impair discipline and subordination in the army by my pardons and respites, but it makes me rested, after a hard day\u2019s work, if I can find some good excuse for saving a man\u2019s life, and I go to bed happy as I think how joyful the signing of my name will make him (a deserter) and his family.\u201d\n\u201cI have been driven many times to my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else to go.\u201d\nIn addition, Lincoln\u2019s Gettysburg Address and his second inaugural speech are ever relevant. And you may wish to add your own favorites to these.\nPaul\u2019s advice to us in Philippians 4:8 is to \u201cfill your minds with those things that are good and deserve praise: things that are true, noble, right, pure, lovely, and honorable.\u201d\nAs we celebrate his birthday on the 12th, Lincoln\u2019s words more than meet this standard!\nJohn Carter is a Weatherford resident whose column, \u201cNotes From the Journey,\u201d is published weekly in the Weatherford Democrat.","id":"<urn:uuid:d53f9812-f42b-4039-a509-209a2d5aac9b>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/weatherforddemocrat.com\/opinion\/x1303543173\/NOTES-FROM-THE-JOURNEY-Lincoln-is-still-one-for-the-ages","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9683926702,"token_count":821,"score":3.390625,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Salt Reduction Strategies\nTasting Success with Cutting Salt\nTwenty-Five Science Based Strategies & Culinary Insights\nDepartment of Nutrition, Harvard School of Public Health & The Culinary Institute of America\nTable of Contents\nWhat portion size, produce, fresh foods, and healthy fats have to do with sodium reduction\nWhy a stealth health approach can help everyone cut back on salt\nWhich foods are highest in sodium, and how to make lower sodium choices\nFrom the farm to the table, there are many ways to boost flavor that are light on salt\nFuture research can guide the way to compelling reduced sodium flavors\nDownload a PDF of\nRead more about the creation of\nThe Institute of Medicine\u2019s newly released report, Strategies to Reduce Sodium Intake in the United States, focuses on big-picture strategies for reining in America\u2019s salt habit. (1) Although the report\u2019s recommendations represent an essential step forward, there are many things that individuals, chefs, and organizations can do right now to reduce sodium.\nConsumers can use these tips when they cook at home, shop in the supermarket, or choose a meal at their favorite restaurant. Chefs and product developers can tap these ideas in the professional kitchen. Media representatives, healthcare professionals, and food marketers can mine this list for ways to promote positive and delicious nutrition messages about cutting salt.\nMany of these guidelines offer a \u201cstealth health\u201d approach to sodium reduction\u2014ways that sodium can be reduced with no change or minimal change to consumer food experiences or choices. Others suggest ways to rebalance and re-imagine food choices as well as introduce new foods that can easily translate into satisfying meals. These culinary insights are in addition to valuable food science research already underway on the role of salt in foods and salt substitutes. The good news is that most of these guidelines support broader diet recommendations for good health.\nNo sodium reduction effort will succeed if it undermines the flavor of our foods and the role that food plays in our lives. That\u2019s why we urge a wide-ranging, innovative approach to sodium reduction on the part of all stakeholders, one that puts as much emphasis on culinary insight, taste, and flavor as on the scientific and public health imperatives.\n1. Downsize your portions: You\u2019ll scale back the sodium (and the calories).\nA good rule of thumb is that the more calories a meal has, the more sodium it has. Two out of three Americans need to lose weight. So skip the supersize. Share a dish when dining out. You can cut your salt\u2014and trim your waist.\nOur bodies need more potassium than sodium. But most Americans\u2019 diets are just the opposite, which can contribute to high blood pressure. Fruits and vegetables are naturally low in sodium, and many fruits and vegetables are good sources of potassium. Filling your plate with them will boost your potassium and shift the sodium-potassium balance in your favor. And chefs and product developers would do well to think about produce first when designing menus. The next time you are tempted to say, \u201cI won\u2019t like lower sodium foods\u201d think of biting into a crunchy apple, juicy orange, or sweet strawberry. Not missing the sodium?\n3. Get fresh: Choose unprocessed and minimally processed foods.\nProcessed foods and prepared foods are the greatest sources of sodium in the American diet (75 percent by some estimates). By choosing fresh foods, you can decide how much or how little salt to add. Processed, cured meats typically have much more sodium than fresh meats, and canned vegetables usually have more sodium than fresh vegetables. Going easy on processed foods makes sense for general good health, as processing often leads to a loss of nutrients and other benefits of whole or semi-intact foods.\n4. Embrace healthy fats and oils: A savory strategy to lower sodium levels.\nUnfortunately, the big low-fat and no-fat product push in the 1990\u2019s wasn\u2019t rooted in sound science. Many well-meaning product developers cut both the good and bad fats out of formulations, and in order to maintain consumer acceptance of their products, they were forced to increase levels of sugar and sodium. So breathe easy, and skip most fat-free salad dressings and other similar products, and you\u2019ll be doing your blood pressure a favor. One more good news tip: Fat in the diet doesn\u2019t make you fat! Extensive research now confirms that low-fat diets are no more effective in weight loss than moderate- to high-fat diets. Rather, it\u2019s all about total calories and energy balance. So embrace healthy fat: It might be just the ticket to make produce-centric (and sodium-reduced) cooking more appealing. For recipes that focus on healthy fat, try:\n5. Stealth health: The most delicious approach to sodium reduction.\nFor many foods and preparations, the average person can\u2019t detect moderate to substantial differences in sodium levels, including reductions of up to as much as 25 percent. That\u2019s great news. In fact, many food manufacturers and restaurant companies have already made or are in the process of making substantial cuts in sodium\u2014some all at once and some over time\u2014that their customers will not be able to detect.\n6. Retrain your taste buds: You can learn to savor foods with less salt.\nStudies have found that we can shift our sense of taste to enjoy foods with lower levels of sodium. One key to success: Make the changes gradually and consistently over a period of time, rather than trying to cut back by a large amount all at once (unless of course you find that an immediate 25 percent reduction in sodium doesn\u2019t undermine your enjoyment of a particular food). Try this trick: Combine a reduced sodium version of a favorite product (e.g., vegetable soup) with a regular version in proportions that gradually favor the reduced sodium version. As time goes on, you won\u2019t miss the salt.\n7. Try a little romance: Sea salt and other secrets of the healthy kitchen.\nMost sea salt has about the same level of sodium as other salts, but who doesn\u2019t perk up with the mention of sea salt? It sounds like your favorite chef has taken charge of your dinner. You don\u2019t need to spend the money on sea salt, just remember that we eat with our eyes and ears, not just our mouths\u2014and we make decisions about how much we are likely to enjoy a given food long before it gets to our mouths. So instead of calling something \u201clow sodium,\u201d try language like \u201cwith a touch of sea salt,\u201d \u201ccitrus-infused\u201d or \u201cgarlic-scented,\u201d and you\u2019ll likely entice more people to taste and enjoy reduced sodium dishes. Finally, for those who think \u201clow sodium\u201d is the exact opposite of a compelling, positive message, remember that there is a big difference between well-prepared low-sodium foods and badly executed low-sodium foods. Bad cooking is just bad cooking, independent of sodium levels.\n8. Target high-volume sodium sources: Prioritize your efforts.\nKnow which ingredients and individual foods are high in sodium, and eat them sparingly. Understand which categories of foods contribute the most sodium to our diets through repeated daily and weekly consumption. Salt is ubiquitous in the American diet, but this top 10 list of food sources of sodium in the U.S. diet is a good place to focus. The list is based on the combination of each item\u2019s sodium content and the frequency of consumption. (2) Choose carefully when buying foods in these categories and\/or eat less of these items:\n- Meat pizza\n- White bread\n- Processed cheese\n- Hot dogs\n- Spaghetti with sauce\n- Cooked rice\n- White rolls\n- Flour tortillas\n9. Scan the label: Look for foods with less than 300 milligrams of sodium per serving.\nCanned, boxed, frozen, and prepared foods can be high in sodium. Check the label for sodium amounts and choose foods that have less than 300 milligrams per serving. But pay attention to serving sizes, as they are often unrealistically small. A good rule of thumb for label reading is to look for no more than one milligram of sodium per one calorie of food. You may be surprised to find foods that are high in sodium but that don\u2019t list \u201csalt\u201d in the ingredients. That\u2019s because there are other forms of sodium used in food processing, and these all contribute to the total amount of sodium listed in the Nutrition Facts. Examples of these ingredients include monosodium glutamate, sodium citrate, sodium bicarbonate, and sodium alginate.\n10. Compare, compare, compare: Sodium levels vary widely for the same or similar grocery items.\nCompare brands of processed food, including breads, cured meats, cheeses, snack foods, and other foods, choosing those with the lowest levels of sodium that still taste good. You\u2019ll find that there\u2019s a surprising degree of variation from brand to brand, since some food manufacturers have already made great strides toward cutting the sodium levels in their products\u2014and others never added as much sodium in the first place.\n11. Watch out for hidden sodium: Looks\u2014and taste\u2014can be deceiving.\n\u201cFresh\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d meats and poultry may be injected with salt solutions as part of their processing, and manufacturers are not required to list the sodium content on the label. The best way to find out whether your favorite brand has been treated with a salt solution is to ask the grocer or butcher, or to call the toll-free consumer hotline on the product\u2019s label. Some foods that are high in sodium may not taste especially salty, such as breakfast cereals, bakery muffins, energy drinks, and sports drinks.\n12. Scan the menu, speak to your server: Seek low-salt menu options when dining out.\nAt the upper end of the spectrum, some chain restaurant and fast-food meals can top 5,000\u20136,000 milligrams of sodium per serving. It is common to find sandwiches and fast-food entr\u00e9es with 2,000\u20132,500 milligrams of sodium per serving\u2014as much as or more than a day\u2019s recommended sodium intake. With foodservice (or food away from home) now accounting for nearly 50 percent of the consumer food dollar, both foodservice and food manufacturing\u2014together with consumers and home cooks\u2014need to be part of the solution to the sodium reduction challenge. Some tips for consumers: Sodium levels can vary widely from one dish to another and from one restaurant to another. Check restaurant websites for sodium information before you head out, or ask your server to steer you to low-salt choices. Save high-salt choices for very limited special occasions. Increasingly, chain restaurants are responding to calls for sodium reduction, so watch for news about such initiatives by your favorite restaurant group.\n13. Farming for flavor: A new health imperative.\nWe should recognize that the national conversation about salt and sodium should not be just about salty taste and sodium reduction, but about flavor in our foods in general. For much of the 20th century, our national food and agricultural focus has been on quantity and value\u2014and quality often as a function of consistency, appearance, safety, convenience, and shelf life. If natural flavor sometimes suffered, there was always fat (often saturated fats and trans fats), sugar, and salt to take up the slack\u2014all high-impact, low-cost flavor enhancers that most people love. But at a time when we have \u201cover-delivered\u201d on the promise of affordable calories, and both salt and sugar (and all refined carbohydrates) are turning out to have serious negative health consequences, we need to refocus our attention on enhancing natural flavors. As a practical matter, this means growing more flavorful tomatoes at the same time we try to reduce the sodium in tomato soup.\n14. Know your seasons, and, even better, your local farmer.\nShop for raw ingredients with maximum natural flavor, thereby avoiding the need to add as much (if any) sodium. Seek out peak-of-season produce from farmers\u2019 markets and your local supermarket.\nOne of the easiest ways to reduce the need for added salt is through the use of ingredients such as spices, dried and fresh herbs, roots (such as garlic and ginger), citrus, vinegars, and wine. From black pepper, cinnamon and turmeric to fresh basil, chile peppers and lemon juice, these flavor enhancers create excitement on the palate\u2014and can do it with less sodium.\n16. Go nuts for healthy fats in the kitchen.\nAs chefs and home cooks know, fat is a great carrier and enhancer of flavor. Using the right healthy fats\u2014from roasted nuts and avocados to olive, canola, soybean, and other oils\u2014can help make up for any flavor loss from using less salt. Some healthy fats contribute their own flavors (think peanut butter and extra virgin olive oil), while other fats help to juice up flavor in pan searing and frying. For creative cooks, roasted nuts ground with spices extend and leverage small amounts of salt, such as in the Middle Eastern spice mixture.\nUmami (pronounced oo-MAH-me), or savoriness, is the so-called \u201cfifth taste\u201d that in recent years sensory scientists have brought into the mainstream of academic research. Foods that are naturally high in a compound called \u201cL-glutamate\u201d trigger our \u201cumami\u201d taste receptors. Cooked chicken, fish, beef, and soybeans are naturally high in umami, as are mushrooms, tomatoes, seaweed, carrots, and Chinese cabbage. Incorporating these foods into meals can add a delicious depth of flavor without adding salt. Some foods that are high in umami are also high in sodium, including soy sauce, fish sauce, aged cheeses, miso, and anchovy paste. The cook\u2019s best strategy: Use these ingredients in small amounts instead of adding salt, reducing the overall sodium in the dish. Check out these two recipes from the Culinary Institute of America that boost \u201cumami\u201d:\nTake the time to learn some simple cooking techniques that can make your cooking less reliant on sodium. Searing and saut\u00e9ing foods in a pan builds flavor (try searing umami-rich mushrooms in a hot pan with oil, and now you have a double flavor-building impact!). Roasting brings out the natural sweetness of many vegetables and the savoriness of fish and chicken. Steaming and microwaving tend to dilute flavors; perk up steamed dishes with a finishing drizzle of flavorful oil and a squeeze of citrus.\n19. Wait! Be careful how you spend that sodium budget.\nSave your \u201csodium budget\u201d to enhance the flavors of produce, whole grains, nuts and legumes, and other healthy ingredients versus \u201coverspending\u201d it on salty snacks, heavily processed food, high-sodium fast foods, and other foods that we should be consuming in smaller amounts. We all love treats, and most of us have to eat on the run occasionally (that\u2019s why they call it \u201cfast food\u201d). But if we do this too often in a way that \u201cblows\u201d our sodium budget, we come up short without enough tools to enhance the flavors of healthy, everyday cooking. The best intentions to reduce sodium are definitely going to run aground when too many high-sodium ingredients are aggregated in the same dish. Rethink that double bacon cheeseburger or the breakfast special with ham and sausage.\nPickles, capers, cured meats, grated aged cheeses, mustard, catsup, soy sauce, hot sauce, smoked fish, and other condiments and specialty foods all bring added satisfaction to the table. There is no need to give up condiments, which in many cases represent culinary traditions that are centuries old. In some cases, reduced sodium versions of these are now available; in other cases, we can just use them more sparingly.\n21. Go global: Discover a world of ideas for flavor development.\nLook to global culinary traditions\u2014from Europe and the Mediterranean, Latin America, Asia and Africa\u2014for healthy ideas to transform fruits, vegetables, and other healthy ingredients into exciting flavors and meals. Because many of these world culinary traditions build up flavor in such novel, complex, and intriguing ways, cooks are under less pressure to use as much sodium. Sometimes these flavors will appear in the U.S. or their native countries in higher sodium versions, but the culinary ideas for lower sodium strategies are still there, embedded in traditional cultural approaches to flavor development that go way beyond fat, salt, and sugar (our all-too-frequent default flavor enhancers in the U.S.). Two international recipe suggestions are:\nAvoid \u201cdouble salting\u201d your foods when cooking, and look for ways to pair salted flavors with unsalted or under-salted foods, especially fresh produce. If you are adding a little cheese to your salad, you don\u2019t need much or any salt in your dressing. If you are adding a ham bone to a soup pot, lighten up on the sodium for the rest of the soup. In a sandwich, try adding sliced cucumber instead of pickles. A pot of brown rice or whole grain pasta doesn\u2019t need to be salted if you are serving it with other adequately seasoned items or sauces. And an adequately seasoned crust or condiment may lessen the need for salting the rest of the dish.\n23. Rinse, wash, and dilute: You can easily cut some of the excess sodium in processed foods with no loss of flavor.\nDraining and rinsing canned foods can dramatically cut their sodium levels\u2014in the case of canned beans, cooks can cut 40 percent of the sodium with this trick. When making soup, dilute reduced sodium chicken broth with water or wine instead of using it full strength, and float in some additional vegetables and herbs.\n24. Whole grains: Beyond bread and sandwiches.\nCollectively, because we eat so much of it, bread is one of the largest contributors of sodium to our diets. Even whole grain bread, while a healthier choice than white, can contain considerable sodium. But only part of the sodium in bread is for taste: Much of it is used to help the bread-making process and preserve the final results. You can skip that extra salt when you use these marvelous whole grains by themselves. Try a Mediterranean-inspired whole grain salad with chopped vegetables, nuts, and legumes, perhaps a small amount of cheese, herbs and spices, and healthy oils and vinegar or citrus. You can enjoy many of the same flavors you love in a sandwich, but in a delicious new form that has much less sodium. For breakfast, cook up steel cut oats, farro, or other intact whole grains with a generous amount of fresh or dried fruit, and you can skip the toast (and the extra sodium).\n25. Kick the \u201cauto-salt\u201d habit: Taste before you salt.\nToo many of us have the habit of reaching for the salt shaker as soon as our plates are put in front of us. Try taking the salt shaker off the table and making it available \u201cupon request only.\u201d Always, always taste your food before you salt: Maybe you don\u2019t need the extra sodium. And in the kitchen, add salt late in the cooking process. Foods release their flavors (and salt, in the case of salted ingredients) during the cooking process, and \u201cpalate fatigue\u201d on the part of the cook can cause over-salting if this is undertaken too early.\nGiven how vital sodium reduction is, and how embedded sodium is in our food supply, culinary techniques, flavor strategies, manufacturing methods, and marketing assumptions, it is essential that we conduct additional research to shed more light on which sodium reduction strategies are most effective. The challenges here are far more complex than they were for trans fats, which are more easily isolated and replaced in the food supply. In addition to food science and engineering fixes to the high-sodium problem, we need to engage chefs, menu developers, consumer opinion researchers, and a wide range of flavor experts in developing and pursuing key research questions. With the benefit of this research, we will be better positioned to create reduced sodium flavors and food choices that consumers find not just acceptable, but compelling.\n1. Institute of Medicine..

Forces of 100,000 or\neven more, unheard of a century before, were\nnot at all unusual by 1815.\nThe French army introduced the concept of\na corps d\u2019armee, a body of infantry,\ncavalry and artillery plus essential services.\nThe corps could fight alone or in cooperation\nwith other corps, and included all necessary\ncombat and administrative elements. By the\nend of the Napoleonic wears, all participants\nhad organized their troops into corps, usually\nmade up of varying numbers of divisions and\nDuring the years after 1815, some nations\nkept their corps structure in place during\npeacetime, using them to administer recruiting,\ntraining and other non-combat functions. This\nwould speed mobilization and keep the staffs\nemployed. The size and composition of corps\nalso became regularized, with each usually\nhaving the same number and types of subordinate\nBy the middle of the 19th century, an army\ncorps had become defined as the number of\ntroops that could be deployed from a single\nroad in less than two hours: roughly 20,000\nmen. That rule of thumb had been badly exceeded\nas extra troops were added: cavalry, engineers,\nartillerymen, light infantry, medical services,\nsupply columns and more.\nThe Prussian corps organization used in\nthe 1866 Austro-Prussian War had been introduced\nas part of War Minister Albrecht von Roon\u2019s\nreforms starting in 1860. In 1859, the Prussian\nArmy mobilized its four army corps for war\non the side of Austria against France. The\nmobilization found many troops untrained,\nofficers of poor quality and supply services\neither insufficient or non-existent.\nIt also showed just how unwieldy the army\u2019s\ncorps organization would prove in action.\nThe German Confederation, which included both\nAustria and Prussia along with 36 other german\nstates, had adopted a corps of four divisions.\nEach division consisted in turn of two or\nthree brigades, each brigade with two regiments\nof two battalions each plus one of light infantry.\nAll told, a German division would go to war\nwith 10 or 15 battalions, a corps with between\n40 and 60.\nRoon rationalized this organization; in\nbattle, he believed, a general was most efficient\nwith fewer maneuver elements to command. A\nnew-model Prussian infantry corps would have\ntwo divisions. Each division in turn had two\nbrigades, and each of them had two regiments.\nThe regiments would be larger, with three\nbattalions rather than the former two, as\na regimental colonel was expected to control\nall three by line of sight.\nA brigade commander only had to control\nthe two regiments under his command. At the\ndivision level, things got more complex. The\ndivision controlled two brigades, plus an\nartillery detachment of four six-gun batteries.\nThese would usually be parceled out to the\nbrigades in action. During peacetime the division\nwas responsible for either a pioneer battalion\nor a light infantry battalion; during wartime\nthese would be held in the corps reserve.\nThe corps controlled the two infantry divisions,\nplus attachments of artillery and cavalry.\nThis varied from four to seven batteries (six\nguns each) and two to five cavalry regiments.\nAustria also reformed its corps organization\nin 1860, based on the lessons of the 1859\nwar. An Austrian corps had included two or\nthree divisions, each in turn of two or three\nfive-battalion brigades. Each brigade included\nthe four field battalions of a single regiment\nplus a light infantry battalion: usually j\u00e4gers\nbut in a few cases grenzers (Croatian border\ntroops) or volunteer student battalions.\nAustrian generals performed poorly in the\n1859 war, and the reform commission appointed\nafter the war recommended using fewer of them.\nIn particular, it pointed out that the small\nbrigades made regimental colonels superfluous.\nA peacetime regiment had contained four field\nbattalions and a grenadier battalion; now\nthey would have three field battalions, a\nfourth reserve battalion and in wartime a\nfifth training battalion. Two of these three-battalion\nregiments would be grouped in a brigade along\nwith a light infantry battalion and an eight-gun\nartillery battery. It was a powerful and flexible\norganization, led by a major general (Austria\ndid not have a \u201cbrigadier general\u201d\nrank and this was the imperial army\u2019s\nequivalent). The larger brigades required\nfewer light infantry battalions, allowing\nthe role to be filled exclusively by j\u00e4gers.\nThe organization became less flexible at\nthe larger echelons. An Austrian corps included\nfour infantry brigades, a cavalry regiment\nand a brigade-sized artillery reserve as well\nas engineer, supply and medical units. The\nnew arrangement required fewer general officers,\nwhich had been the goal. But handling six\nmaneuver elements proved beyond the capability\nof most Austrian corps staffs in 1866, and\nthe intermediate stage of division headquarters\ngave Austria\u2019s Prussian opponents a\ndecided advantage in flexibility and reaction\nspeed. Though the Prussian staff was undoubtedly\nbetter organized and more efficient than their\nAustrian counterparts, their organization\nalso gave them a lighter workload.\nof 1866: Frontier Battles the units are infantry brigades,\ncavalry regiments and artillery batteries,\nbut players maneuver their units by corps.\nThe corps are activated by the army command,\nor through the initiative of the corps commander.\nThe Prussians generally activate in a much\nmore predictable fashion, and can get all\nof their units into action thanks to the division\ncommanders. An Austrian corps is much more\ndifficult to handle and often only gets into\naction piece by piece.\nhere to order Battles of 1866: Frontier Battles now.","id":"<urn:uuid:7d84fe71-cb98-4aca-863d-b31baad541c3>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.avalanchepress.com\/PrussianOrganization.php","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9506396651,"token_count":1343,"score":3.5625,"int_score":4}
{"text":"Lady Liquor: The Racial Implications of the \"Disease\" Model of Alcoholism\nEarlier in this series I wrote about the notion that the desire for intoxication may be universal, and how that connects with the \u201cdisease model\u201d of addiction. The disease model, as far as I can tell, first gained traction as an idea in the 1930s with the formation of Alcoholics Anonymous. Groups similar to AA, such as the Washingtonian Movement and the Oxford fellowship (which AA cofounder Bill Wilson attended before forming his own voluntary fellowship) had existed prior to AA's formation, but AA took off in a way they never did, for a variety of reasons. Alcoholism wasn't recognized as a disease by medical and psychiatric associations until the 1950s \u2013 but the disease model is now pretty firmly entrenched in our understanding of chemical dependency.\nPersonally, I don't think it's an accident that AA was formed just a few years after Prohibition ended. Its formation represented a fundamental cultural shift \u2013 one that recognized prohibiting the sale of alcohol had not solved any of the problems that concerned Temperance leaders, including the way problem drinking affected families. It still prescribed total abstinence from alcohol, just not for the entire population. And while Temperance leaders placed more of the blame for problem drinking on alcohol itself \u2013 and the people who sold it \u2013 than on the drinkers, heavy drinking was still viewed as a moral failure rather than a medical problem. In the decades after the advent of AA, many cities' laws against public drunkenness were thrown out or softened, and instead of being thrown into drunk tanks, people found stumbling around or sleeping it off in public spaces were taken to detox and rehab facilities \u2013 a problematic policy shift in itself since people who aren't ready for rehab won't benefit from it but still, arguably, a change for the better. All of that resulted from a movement that has attempted to make addiction a morally neutral, medical issue and has argued for treating people with addiction issues with compassion rather than dismissive contempt.\nBut our understanding of addiction, through the disease model lens, has evolved in odd ways. (It occurs to me, for instance, that if 12-step recovery programs don't necessarily view addiction as a moral problem, they promote a faith-based \u2013 and therefore \u201cmoral,\u201d in some sense \u2013 solution.) In the 1980s, researchers began investigating a potential link between addiction and genetics \u2013 and almost immediately started talking about whether genetics would explain why some races or nationalities had higher incidences of problem drinking than others.\nAgain, it was offered as a morally neutral alternative to existing stereotypes about weak-willed, shiftless or mean drunks, particularly those in certain minority groups (Native Americans, and to a much, much, lesser extent, Irish-Americans). Brown University epidemiologist Stephen Buka, in a paper discussing health disparities as they relate to substance abuse, notes that there is greater genetic variability within major racial groups than between them and that racial disparities in health status. Research on ethnicity and race as they relate to heavy drinking is intrinsically problematic, if not impossible to conduct, because these are plastic concepts that change with society; discussions about the ethnic connection to drinking invariably group all native Americans (on both continents) into one single ethnic category; in the same discussions, the Irish are presented as genetically distinct from all other European ethnicities.\nThe same way that evolutionary psychology (or at least, bad reporting on evolutionary research) often conveniently reinforces sexist stereotypes about the role of men and women in the 21st society, genetic explanations for alcoholism tend to reinforce preexisting stereotypes about certain ethnic groups and races \u2013 in the case of both Native Americans and (now fully assimilated, but still cheekily stereotyped) Irish-Americans, these are stereotypes that date back centuries before the discovery of DNA; stories about the purported \u201cout-of-control\u201d drinking habits of Native Americans date back to the first interactions between white explorers and natives, with the former presenting their own drinking norms as refined and in control. Socioogist and social worker Richard Thatcher, author of the 2004 book Fighting Firewater Fictions: Moving Beyond the Disease Model of Alcoholism, argues that both the disease model and the \u201cfirewater myth\u201d not only cast Native American people in the most essentialist terms, but considers problem drinking from the social, cultural and economic realities with which many indigenous people cope \u2013 perpetuating a racist status quo and leading many young people to believe they will eventually, inevitably become alcoholics themselves. That becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, particularly in cultures (Thatcher's work focuses on indigenous people in Canada) where no effort is made to address the other societal factors that lead to problem drinking.\nPeople drink for a lot of reasons: to celebrate, to grieve, to relax and, I would argue, we sometimes drink, too much, too heavily, to bear the unbearable, including systematic racism (not just on the part of indigenous peoples, but other racial minorities as well). While removing moral judgment from that coping mechanism is a step in the right direction, treating alcoholism as a disease separate from the social and historic factors that brought it about in the first place gives societies license to continue not addressing those factors. It gives dominant groups a pass to perpetuate the racist status quo, rather than helping to improve the living conditions and economic prospects of Native people. Where alcohol dependence and ongoing marginalizing intersect is where the discourse\u2014and the treatment\u2014should be centered.\nPreviously: Race, marketing, and uneasy relationships\nComments11 comments have been made.

{"text":"The transportation sector is responsible for an enormous amount of pollution, from fuel extraction and processing to greenhouse gas emissions and smog. Thankfully, old and new technologies alike can help us clean up our footprint as we get from here to there. Here are three options to consider.\n1. Cargo Bike\nA cool trend in green transportation is the use of cargo bikes (sometimes called pedicabs), mainly in cities. The idea is that pedal power transports people or bins of cargo (see photo above) \u2014 meaning goods can be delivered and people can get around without the use of fuel. Some companies that operate locally are even delivering their goods with bike power.\nYou can create your own cargo bike by hooking a small cart to the back of your bicycle. You can take your recycling to the recycling center or take trips to the store or farmers market and transport your goods home without relying on a vehicle.\nTo learn much more about this trend, see Cargo Bikes and Pedicabs.\n2. Commuter Bicycle\nTo make your daily commute to work \u2014 or even your weekly commute around town to run errands \u2014 there are many great bike options. Biking is a win-win: You get great exercise, enjoy fresh air, and can feel great about using a green form of transportation.\nIf you\u2019ve thought about commuting by bike, but aren\u2019t sure which bicycle is right for you, check out the tips in What the Right Bike Can Do for You.\n3. Green Car\nIf the distance between point A and point B is too great for a bicycle or walking \u2014 and mass transit isn\u2019t an option \u2014 a car can be a necessity. There have been many great strides made in green car technology over the past decade, and your options (check out Best Green Cars for some of them) now extend far beyond the well-known Prius hybrid. New all-electric vehicles, such as the Nissan Leaf, are getting great expert and driver reviews.\nWhile the upfront cost of a hybrid or electric vehicle may be prohibitive, the car can pay for itself over time in fuel cost savings and maintenance cost savings (think no oil changes for an electric car!). Plus, you can take advantage of a $7,500 federal tax credit for the purchase of many green cars \u2014 and be sure to look into what state tax incentives may also be available in your area.\nYou may have heard some common arguments against green cars. Probably the most common is that if an electric car runs on electricity generated by a coal-fired power plant, it isn\u2019t actually cleaner than a regular gas car. The math has been crunched on this issue, and you can find the answers in the article Why Electric Cars Are Cleaner.\nThere have also been some recent concerns about the safety of electric and hybrid cars; rumors on this issue were fueled by a Chevy Volt catching on fire. The green cars on the market today actually have excellent safety ratings, and you can read much more about this issue in The Truth About Electric Car Safety.\nIf you do drive a gas-only car, you can still make driving it as clean as possible by hypermiling (using driving techniques that help you get better gas mileage).

Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the country, according to the CDC.\nFrieden said patients with high blood pressure are either not receiving a correct combination or dosage of medication or are not keeping up with their medication.\nSome doctors are not warning patients who have had multiple readings of high-blood pressure, a problem Frieden said could be solved by better systems to track patients.\nOf the 36 million Americans with uncontrolled hypertension, about 14 million were not aware of their condition and about 22 million either chose not to take medication or were on inadequate treatment, according to the report, which surveyed adults between 2003 and 2010.\n\"I think there's clearly a lot of room for improvement,\" Frieden said, noting that controlling blood pressure often means taking multiple medications daily for the rest of one's life.\nHigh blood pressure can be prevented through diet, exercise and taking drugs such as beta blockers and ACE inhibitors -- which widen arteries. Lowering blood pressure can cut the risk of stroke, heart attack, heart failure and other conditions.\nRisk factors include obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, smoking, and chronic difficulties such as diabetes, kidney disease and high cholesterol.","id":"<urn:uuid:c0253585-f206-42c3-a094-e36a9dad6b37>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/health\/2012\/09\/05\/report-millions-americans-have-uncontrolled-blood-pressure\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9687739611,"token_count":435,"score":2.78125,"int_score":3}

{"text":"The basics of heat stress\nWhen the thermometer rises, it can-and often does-create a multitude of problems. Anyone, given the right (or wrong) conditions, can get heat stress. Some are lucky enough to suffer only from heat cramps, while those who are less fortunate may be laid up by heat exhaustion or devastated by heat stroke. As the long, hot days of summer approach, it is helpful to review the effects of warm weather on the human body, the illnesses that may result and what you can do.\nHow the body stays cool Unknowingly, you constantly engage your body in the life-and-death struggle to disperse the heat it produces. If allowed to accumulate, this heat would quickly increase your body temperature beyond its comfortable 98.6oF. This does not normally happen because your body is able to lose enough heat to maintain a steady temperature. You become aware of this struggle for heat balance during hard labor or exercise in hot environments, when your body produces heat faster than it can lose it. Under certain conditions, your body may build up too much heat, your temperature may rise to life-threatening levels, and you may become delirious or lose consciousness. This is called heat stroke, and it is a serious medical emergency. If you do not rid your body of excess heat fast enough, it cooks the brain and other vital organs. It often is fatal, and those who survive may have permanent damage to their vital organs. Before your temperature reaches heat-stroke levels, however, you may suffer heat exhaustion with its flu-like symptoms, and while treating its symptoms you avoid heat stroke.\nHow does your body dispose of excess heat? Humans lose heat largely through their skin, similar to how a car loses heat through its radiator. Exercising muscles warms the blood, just as a car's hot engine warms its radiator fluid. Warm blood travels through the skin's dilated blood vessels losing heat by evaporating sweat to the surrounding air, just like a car loses engine heat through its radiator.\nWhen blood delivers heat to the skin, two of the most important ways the body loses heat are radiation and evaporation (vaporization of sweat). When the temperature is 70oF or less, the body releases its heat by radiation. As environmental temperatures approach your body temperature, you lose less heat through radiation. In fact, people working on hot summer days actually gain heat through radiation from the sun. This leaves evaporation as the only way to effectively control body temperature.\nWater loss Your body is about half water. You lose about 2 quarts every day (breathing, urinating, bowel movements and sweat). A working adult can produce 2 quarts of sweat per hour for short periods and up to 15 quarts per day. Because the body's water absorption rate of 1.5 quarts per hour is less than the body's 2 quarts per hour sweat rate, dehydration results. This happens because you cannot drink enough water to keep up with your sweat losses.\nIf you drink only when you are thirsty, you are dehydrated already. Thirst is not a good guide for when to drink water. In fact, in hot and humid conditions, you may be so dehydrated by the time you become thirsty that you will have trouble catching up with your fluid losses. One guideline regarding your water intake is to monitor your urine. You are getting enough water if you produce clear urine at least five times a day. Cloudy or dark urine, or urinating less than five times a day, means you should drink more.\nIn the Gulf War, American armed forces followed the practice of the Israeli army: drinking a minimum of 1 quart of fluid per hour. This tactic resulted in zero deaths from heat illness. In contrast, during the Six Day War of 1967, more than 20,000 Egyptian soldiers died3\/4with no visible wounds3\/4most likely from dehydration and heat illness because they were restricted to 3 quarts daily.\nWhile working in hot weather, drink 8 ounces of water every 20 minutes. Generally, 16 ounces is the most a person can comfortably drink at once. You cannot \"catch up\" by drinking extra water later because only about 1 quart of water per hour can pass out of the stomach. Therefore, if possible, workers should begin drinking water before they start work.\nCool water (50oF) is easier for the stomach to absorb than warm water, and a little flavoring may make the water more tasty. The best fluids are those that leave the stomach fast and contain little sodium and some sugar (less than 8 percent). You should avoid coffee and tea because they contain caffeine, which is a diuretic that increases water loss through urination. Alcoholic beverages also dehydrate by increasing urination. Soda pop contains about 10 percent sugar and, therefore, your body does not absorb it as well as water or commercial sports drinks. The sugar content of fruit juices ranges from 11 to 18 percent and has an even longer absorption time. Commercial sports drinks contain about 5 to 8 percent sugar.\nElectrolyte loss Sweat and urine contain potassium and sodium, which are essential electrolytes that control the movement of water in and out of the body's cells. Many everyday foods contain these electrolytes. Bananas and nuts are rich with potassium, and most American diets have up to 10 times as much sodium as the body needs. Getting enough salt is rarely a problem in the typical American diet. In fact, most Americans consume an excessive amount of sodium-averaging 5 to 10 grams of sodium per day-although we probably require only 1 to 3 grams. Therefore, sodium loss is seldom a problem, unless a person is sweating profusely for long periods and drinking large amounts of water.\nCommercial sports drinks can be useful if you are participating in vigorous physical activity for longer than 1 hour (some experts say longer than 4 hours). Most of the time, however, people merely require water to remain hydrated. The truth is that excessive sodium can draw water out of the body cells, accentuating the dehydration. In addition, drinking large amounts of water (more than 1 quart an hour) can cause water intoxication, a condition that flushes electrolytes from the body. Frequent urination and behavior changes (irrationality, combativeness, coma, seizures, etc.) are signs of water intoxication.\nEffects of humidity Sweat can only cool the body if it evaporates. In dry air, you will not notice sweat evaporating. However, sweat cannot evaporate in high-humidity conditions; it just drips off the skin. At about 70-percent humidity, sweating is ineffective in cooling the body.\nBecause humidity can significantly reduce evaporative cooling, a highly humid but mildly warm day can be more stressful than a hot, dry one. Therefore, the higher the humidity, the lower the temperature at which heat risk begins, especially those who are generating heat with vigorous work.\nWho is at risk? Everyone is susceptible to heat illness if environmental conditions overwhelm the body's temperature-regulating mechanisms. Heat waves can set the stage for a rash of heat-stroke victims. For example, during the 1995 summer heat wave in Chicago, the death toll reached 590.\nPeople who are obese, chronically ill or alcoholics have an increased risk. The elderly are at higher risk because of impaired cardiac output and decreased ability to sweat. Infants and young children also are susceptible to heat stroke, as well.\nThe fluid loss and dehydration resulting from physical activity puts outdoor laborers at particular risk. Certain medications predispose individuals to heat stroke, such as drugs that alter sweat production (antihistamines, antipsychotics, antidepressants) or interfere with thermoregulation.\nHeat illnesses Several disorders exist along the spectrum of heat illnesses. Heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke are on the more serious side of the scale, whereas heat syncope, heat edema and prickly heat are less serious (see \"Heat illnesses,\" page C 18). Only heat stroke is life-threatening. Untreated heat-stroke victims always die.\n* Heat cramps are painful muscular spasms that occur suddenly. They usually involve the muscles in the back of the leg or the abdominal muscles. They tend to occur immediately after exertion and are caused by salt depletion. Victims may be drinking water without adequate salt content. However, some experts disagree because the typical American diet is heavy with salt.\n* Heat exhaustion is characterized by heavy perspiration with normal or slightly above-normal body temperatures. A depletion of water or salt3\/4or both3\/4causes this condition. Some experts believe severe dehydration is a better term because it happens to workers who do not drink enough fluids while working in hot environments. Symptoms include severe thirst, fatigue, headache, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. The affected person often mistakenly believes he or she has the flu. Uncontrolled heat exhaustion can evolve into heat stroke.\n* Heat stroke is classified in two ways: classic and exertional. Classic heat stroke, also known as the \"slow cooker,\" may take days to develop. This condition is prevalent during summer heat waves and typically affects poor, elderly, chronically ill, alcoholic or obese persons. Because the elderly often have medical problems, heat stroke exacerbates the problem, and more than 50 percent of elderly heat-stroke victims die3\/4even with medical care. Death results from a combination of a hot environment and dehydration. Exertional heat stroke also is more common in the summer. You see it frequently in athletes, laborers and military personnel who sweat profusely. Known as the \"fast cooker,\" this condition affects healthy, active individuals who strenuously work or play in a warm environment. Exertional heat-stroke victims usually are sweating when stricken, while the classic victims are not sweating. Its rapid onset does not allow enough time for severe dehydration to occur.\nBecause uncontrolled heat exhaustion can evolve into heat stroke, you should know how to tell the difference between them. If the victim feels extremely hot when touched, suspect heat stroke. Another mark of heat stroke is that the victim's mental status (behavior) changes drastically3\/4ranging from being slightly confused and disoriented to falling into a coma. In between these conditions, victims usually become irrational, agitated or even aggressive and may have seizures. In severe cases, the victim can go into a coma in less than 1 hour. The longer a coma lasts, the lower the chance for survival, so rescuers must be quick.\nA third way of distinguishing heat stroke from heat exhaustion is by rectal temperature. Obviously, this is not very practical because conscious heat-stroke victims may not cooperate. Taking a rectal temperature can be embarrassing to both victim and rescuer. Moreover, rectal thermometers are seldom available, and the whole procedure of finding the appropriate thermometer and then using it wastes time and distracts from important emergency care. In most cases, an ambulance arrives within 10 to 20 minutes.\n* Heat syncope, in which a person becomes dizzy or faints after exposure to high temperatures, is a self-limiting condition. Victims should lie down in a cool place when it occurs. Victims who are not nauseated can drink water.\n* Heat edema, which is also a self-limiting condition, causes ankles and feet to swell from heat exposure. It is more common in women unacclimated to a hot climate. It is related to salt and water retention and tends to disappear after acclimation. Wearing support stockings and elevating the legs often helps reduce swelling.\n* Prickly heat, also known as a heat rash, is an itchy rash that develops on skin that is wet from sweating. Dry and cool the skin.\nCooling methods Sometimes the only way to stop possible damage is to cool the victim as quickly as possible. However, it is important to pay attention to both the cooling methods and cautions.\n* Ice baths cool a victim quickly but require a great deal of ice3\/4at least 80 pounds3\/4to be effective. Needing a big enough tub also limits this method. Cool-water baths3\/4(less than 60oF)3\/4can be successful if you stir the water to prevent a warm layer from forming around the body. This is the most effective method in highly humid conditions (greater than 75-percent humidity).\n* Spraying the victim with water combined with fanning is another method for cooling the body. The water droplets act as artificial sweat and cool the body through evaporation. However, this method is not effective in high humidity3\/4greater than 75 percent.\n* Ice bags wrapped in wet towels and placed against the large veins in the groin, armpits and sides of the neck also cool the body, though not nearly as quickly as immersion.\nCautions to remember when employing any cooling method include: * Do not delay the onset of cooling while waiting for an ambulance. Doing so increases the risk of tissue damage and prolonged hospitalization. * Stop cooling when the victim's mental status improves to avoid hypothermia. * Do not use rubbing alcohol to cool the skin. It can be absorbed into the blood, causing alcohol poisoning. Its vapors are a potential fire hazard. * Do not use aspirin or acetaminophen. They are not effective because the brain's control-center temperature is not elevated as it is with fever caused by diseases.\nAdjusting to heat Most heat illness occur during the first days of working in the heat. Therefore, acclimation (adjusting to the heat) is the main preventive measure. To better handle the heat, the body adjusts by decreasing the salt content in sweat and increases the sweating rate. Year-round exercise can help workers prepare for hot weather. Such activity raises the body's core temperature so it becomes accustomed to heat. Full acclimation, however, requires exercise in hot weather. You can do this by exercising a minimum of 60 to 90 minutes in the heat each day for 1 to 2 weeks.\nThe acclimated heart pumps more blood with each stroke than a heart unused to working in the heat. Sweating earlier and doubles the amount of sweat per hour from 1.5 quarts to 3 quarts or more.\nWhen new workers are exposed to hot weather, team them with veterans of the heat who know how much water to drink. Heat illnesses are avoidable. With knowledge, preparation, fluid replacement and prompt emergency care, heat casualties need not be a factor for those working in warm weather.\nDr. Alton Thygerson is a professor of health science at Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah.

{"text":"THE USE OF BRAINSTORMING IN INCREASING STUDENT\u2019S MOTIVATION IN SPEAKING ABILITY IN AL-MUHIBBIN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL GRADE VIII\nby: Iin Nurkhasanah\n- I. INTRODUCTION\n1.1 Background of the study\nEnglish is one of the most important subjects learned in almost all school in every country including Indonesia. The reason why it is important is that because English become an international language. People use English around the world. It is studied seriously because the language is becoming second language in almost all countries. People consciously take many courses and education of English because of an important of the language.\nMany sectors in our daily life need English as the prerequisites. All job application will not be fulfilled without capability of English. People certainly realize and concern about the importance of English since mostly the widespread of the issue had English to become important object to be searched and mastered.\nEnglish is widely used in mass media and oral communication as means of exchanging information, including science and technology reasons. Harmer (2000:1) stated that English has become a lingua franca. It means that English is a means for people who have different language to communicate orally or written form. They use English to enable them to communicate and transfer information.\nThis paper highlights (1) The Use of brainstorming, (2) students\u2019 motivation and (3) Speaking ability\n1.2 Problem of the study\n- What technique use in improving student\u2019s speaking skill?\n- How the use of brainstorming in correct procedure so that students are interesting to engaged with.\n1.3 Objective of the study\n- To know what technique use to improve students\u2019 speaking skill.\n- To know how to apply brainstorming in the class correctly.\n1.4 Significance of the Study\nThis research is intended to offer an alternative technique in enhancing students\u2019 speaking comprehension achievement since a good teacher of English is required to train the students by applying good strategies. The use of brainstorming can make the student feel convenient and confident to speak because the topic is already discussed or they have known before.\nBased on the background of the study above, the hypotheses will be formulated the null hypothesis (Ho) and alternative hypothesis (Ha) as follows.\nH0: There is no significant difference in average score in speaking between students who are taught using brainstorming technique and conventional technique.\nH1: There is no significant difference in average score in speaking between students who are taught using brainstorming technique and conventional technique.\nH0: There is no significant improvement in average score in speaking between students who are taught speaking using brainstorming technique.\nH2 : There is a significant improvement in average score in speaking between students who are taught speaking using brainstorming technique.\nH0 : There is no significant improvement in average score in speaking between students\u2019 who are already taught speaking using brainstorming technique.\nH3 : There is a significant improvement in average score in speaking between students\u2019 who are already taught speaking using brainstorming technique.\nH0 : There is no significant difference in average score in speaking between students\u2019 after taught speaking using brainstorming technique.\nH4 : There is no significant difference in average score in speaking between students\u2019 after being taught speaking using brainstorming technique.\nH0 : There is no significant difference in average score in speaking between students\u2019 after being taught speaking using brainstorming technique.\nH5 : There is a significant difference in average score in speaking between students\u2019 after being taught speaking using brainstorming technique and conventional technique.\nH0 : There is no significant difference in average score in speaking between students who are being taught speaking using brainstorming and conventional technique.\nH6 : There is a significant difference in average score in speaking between students who are being taught speaking using brainstorming and conventional technique.\nH0 : There is no interaction effect of using brainstorming technique and conventional technique towards students\u2019 speaking achievements.\nH7 : There is no interaction effect of using brainstorming technique and conventional technique towards students\u2019 speaking achievements.\n1.6 The Criteria for Testing Hypothesis\nIn this study, the hypothesis that has been formulated before, the writer used the critical value of t-table at the significance 0.05 is with n=30. If the value of t-obtained is higher than value of t-table, the alternative hypothesis 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 will be accepted and the null hypothesis will be rejected. And if the value of t-table is higher than value of t-obtained, they null hypothesis will be accepted and the alternative hypothesis 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 will be rejected. In variance analysis, at the significance 0.05 is with n=30.\n- II. LITERATURE REVIEW\nThe Use of Brainstorming\nBrainstorming is a group creativity technique designed to generate a large number of ideas for the solution of a problem. In 1953 the method was popularized by Alex Faickney Osborn in a book called Applied Imagination. Osborn proposed that groups could double their creative output with brainstorming.\nOxford defined that brainstorming is a way of making a group of people all think about something at the same time, often in order to solve a problem or to create good ideas.\nBrainstorming is the name given to a situation when a group of people meet to generate new ideas around a specific area of interest. Using rules which remove inhibitions, people are able to think more freely and move into new areas of thought and so create numerous new ideas and solutions. The participants shout out ideas as they occur to them and then build on the ideas raised by others. All the ideas are noted down and are not criticized. Only when the brainstorming session is over are the ideas evaluated.\nThe other meaning of brainstorming is To brainstorm is to use a set of specific rules and techniques which encourage and spark off new ideas which would never have happened under normal circumstances. So there you have it: brainstorming will help you come up with new ideas. And not only will you come up with new ideas but you will do so with surprisingly little effort. Brainstorming makes the generation of new ideas easy and is a tried-and-tested process. Exactly what you apply brainstorming techniques to depends on what you want to achieve. You can apply them to develop new products, services and processes in your job, or you can apply them to develop your personal life.\nThere are two models of brainstorming\n- Traditional Brainstorming\nThe normal view of brainstorming is where a group of people sit in a room and shout out ideas as they occur to them. They are told to lose their inhibitions and that no ideas will be judged so that people are free to shout out any ideas at all without feeling uncomfortable. People should build on the ideas called out by other participants. The purpose of this is to gain as many ideas as possible for later analysis. Out of the many ideas suggested there will be some of great value. Because of the free-thinking environment, the session will help promote radical new ideas which break free from normal ways of thinking.\n- Advanced Brainstorming\nThe model we propose is an extension of the traditional brainstorming scenario and makes the whole process easier and more effective. Advanced brainstorming builds on the current methods of brainstorming to produce more original ideas in a more efficient way. Specialized techniques, better processes and better awareness, combined with new technologies make traditional brainstorming a less frustrating process. Most of the problems associated with traditional brainstorming disappear as a more effective process is used. Keep on reading for more details of how you can do advanced brainstorming for great profit to you and your organization.\nAdvanced brainstorming uses:\n- new processes and new training to reduce inhibitions\n- creative and lateral thinking techniques\n- new materials for stimulation and recording ideas\nMotivation in learning English\nMotivation is the driving force which help causes us to achieve goals. Motivation is said to be intrinsic or extrinsic. According to various theories, motivation may be rooted in a basic need to minimize physical pain and maximize pleasure, or it may include specific needs such as eating and resting, or a desired object, goal, state of being, ideal, or it may be attributed to less-apparent reasons such as altruism, selfishness, morality, or avoiding mortality.\nThere are many things instructors can do to prevent glazed-over eyes or nodding heads in a classroom. Faculty can help maintain and increase student motivation by\n- Establishing challenging, but not impossible goals for students. Offering intellectual tasks that are a \u201creach\u201d can spur learners to higher levels of success.\n- Helping students set their own goals for learning that are ambitious, but realistic and achievable. Research shows that, if given a choice, people will choose a challenging, though not daunting task over one that is too hard \u2013 or too easy. While it\u2019s often helpful to offer an easy question first in a discussion or on an exam, it\u2019s counterproductive to make everything too easy.\n- Being clear, specific, and concrete in explaining course material and in giving examples.\n- Organizing student learning; for example, consciously building new material on facts or concepts that students already know.\n- Offering positive, consistent, and timely feedback \u2013 which doesn\u2019t have to mean grades. A brief comment \u2013 if sincere \u2013 may suffice.\nEngaging students in a variety of teaching activities, such as role-playing, problem-solving, or any kind of student interaction, especially if these activities can relate the course to students\u2019 interests and skills. The key here is activity, as passivity can be an impediment to feeling motivated.\nSpeaking means to be able to use language (Oxford, 1986:6). According to Finnociaro and Brumfit (1983:1440) in Nurkhasanah speaking is one of the important language skills that have to be mastered by language learners. They consider that speaking skill is a complex skill, which involves the knowledge of sound, vocabulary and cultural sub-system of English language.\nIt means that the knowledge from pronunciation, structure, vocabulary and cultural system of English system are important and much needed for communicating to society.\nAccording to Yorkey, speaking skill is a skill and like other skill, it must be practiced continuously. The teacher role is becoming important for students later. There are many keys to support speaking skill by listening cassette, watching tv, watching film, practicing with foreigners, practicing with partners.\nDobson is quoted by Fita Krisnawati in her thesis. Speaking is an ability when students can judge how accurate their selling and how they use the sentences they have learned and it merely different when it is conveyed to writing skill, they usually produce rather mistakes but in free speaking, they have tendency to make mistakes that they wouldn\u2019t make in writing 2.\nSpeaking is easy, but conveys the speaking in to meaning is not easy. By having some experts\u2019 statement and some guidance, the writer believes that speaking will easier when someone else opens a certain topic or do the brainstorming. Brainstorming can motivate student to speak because the way of brainstorming work is interesting. It can be compared to students who have no any topic to be talked, they will keep silent because they don\u2019t know what should be talked, the feel afraid to speak, the afraid of making mistakes etc. The use of brainstorming is a good idea to convey students in speaking English everyday.\nNurkhasanah, iin.the effectiveness of teaching speaking through debate activity of eFAC course in Intermediate level.2007\nRichard C Yorkey,\u201dStudy skill for students of English as a second language: New York :MC.Grow Hill, Inc,1990),\nM Dobson, Teaching for skill,Teaching English Forum,XXIV January 1, 1989 p.30.quoted by Krisnawati in unpublished thesis\nJeffrey Baumgartner, the step by step guided by brainstorming.1997, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006 bwiti BVBA Erps-Kwerps, Belgium\nwww.brainstorming.co.uk \u00a91997-2008 Infinite Innovations Ltd.
