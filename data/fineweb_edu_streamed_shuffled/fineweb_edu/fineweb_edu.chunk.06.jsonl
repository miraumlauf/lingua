{"text":"|Scientific Name:||Phoebastria albatrus|\n|Species Authority:||(Pallas, 1769)|\n|Red List Category & Criteria:||Vulnerable D2 ver 3.1|\n|Reviewer\/s:||Butchart, S. & Taylor, J.|\n|Contributor\/s:||Balogh, G., Chan, S., Hasegawa, H., Peet, N., Rivera, K. & Suryan, R.|\nThis species is listed as Vulnerable because, although conservation efforts have resulted in a steady population increase, it still has a very small breeding range, limited to Torishima and Minami-kojima (Senkaku Islands), rendering it susceptible to stochastic events and human impacts.\nPhoebastria albatrus breeds on Torishima (Japan), and Minami-kojima (Senkaku Islands), that are claimed jointly by Japan, mainland China and Chinese Taipei. Historically there are believed to have been at least nine colonies south of Japan and in the East China Sea (Piatt et al. 2006). Its marine range covers most of the northern Pacific Ocean, but it occurs in highest densities in areas of upwelling along shelf waters of the Pacific Rim, particularly along the coasts of Japan, eastern Russia, the Aleutians and Alaska (Piatt et al. 2006, Suryan et al. 2007). During breeding (December - May) it is found in highest densities around Japan. Satellite tracking has indicated that during the post-breeding period, females spend more time offshore of Japan and Russia, while males and juveniles spend greater time around the Aleutian Islands, Bering Sea and off the coast of North America (Suryan et al. 2007). Juveniles have been shown to travel twice the distances per day and spend more time within continental shelf habitat than adult birds (Suryan et al. 2008). The species declined dramatically during the 19th and 20th centuries owing to exploitation for feathers, and was believed extinct in 1949, but was rediscovered in 1951. The current population is estimated, via direct counts and modelling based on productivity data, to be 2,364 individuals, with 1,922 birds on Torishima and 442 birds on Minami-kojima (G.R. Balogh in litt. 2008). In 1954, 25 birds (including at least six pairs) were present on Torishima. Given that there are now c.426 breeding pairs on Torishima (G.R. Balogh in litt. 2008), the species has undergone an enormous increase since its rediscovery and the onset of conservation efforts. In addition, in 2010, one nesting pair was observed on Kure Atoll (Hawaii, USA), but was probably female-female and unsuccessful, and one chick was produced on Midway Atoll (M. Naughton pers. comm. 2011). A tsunami which hit Midway Atoll in March 2011, did not impact on the single pair nesting on Eastern Island (U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service 2008).\nNative:Canada; China; Japan; Korea, Republic of; Mexico; Russian Federation; Taiwan, Province of China; United States; United States Minor Outlying Islands\nPresent - origin uncertain:Northern Mariana Islands; Philippines\n|Range Map:||Click here to open the map viewer and explore range.|\n|Population:||At the end of the 2006-2007 breeding season, the global population was estimated to be 2,364 individuals, with 1,922 birds on Torishima and 442 birds on Minami-kojima (Senkaku Islands). This estimate is based on: direct observation of breeding pairs on Torishima; an assumption on numbers of non-breeding birds; an estimate for the Minami-kojima population that is based upon a 2002 estimate and an assumption of population growth rate (which, together, puts the Minami-kojima population at about 15% of the global population [G.R. Balogh in litt. 2008]). More recently, Brazil (2009) estimates the population in Japan at c.100-10,000 breeding pairs and c.50-1,000 individuals on migration. The population is taken here as likely to number 2,200-2,500 individuals based on these estimates, roughly equating to 1,500-1,700 mature individuals.|\n|Habitat and Ecology:||Behaviour Phoebastria albatrus is a colonial, annually breeding species, with each breeding cycle lasting about 8 months. Birds begin to arrive at the main colony on Torishima Island in early October. A single egg is laid in late October to late November and incubation lasts 64 to 65 days. Hatching occurs in late December through January. Chicks begin to fledge in late May into June. There is little information on timing of breeding on Minami-kojima. First breeding sometimes occurs when birds are five years old, but more commonly when birds are aged six. It forages diurnally and potentially nocturnally, either singly or in groups primarily taking prey by surface-seizing (ACAP 2009). During the breeding season, individuals nesting off Japan forage over the continental shelf (Kiyota and Minami 2008). Habitat Breeding Historically, it preferred level, open, areas adjacent to tall clumps of the grass Miscanthus sinensis for nesting. Diet It feeds mainly on squid, but also takes shrimp, fish, flying fish eggs and other crustaceans (ACAP 2009). It has been recorded following ships to feed on scraps and fish offal.|\n|Major Threat(s):||Its historical decline was caused by exploitation. Today, the key threats are the instability of soil on its main breeding site (Torishima), the threat of mortality and habitat loss from the active volcano on Torishima, and mortality caused by fisheries. Torishima is also vulnerable to other natural disasters, such as typhoons. Introduced predators are a potential threat at colonies. Environmental contaminants at sea (oil based compounds) may also be a threat (G.R. Balogh in litt. 2008). Threats at sea (fisheries, oil pollution) are exacerbated by the fact that birds concentrate into predictable hotspots (Piatt et al. 2006). Modelling work has showed that even a small increase in low level chronic mortality (such as fisheries bycatch) has more of an impact on population growth rates than stochastic and theoretically catastrophic events, such as volcanic eruptions (Finkelstein et al. 2010). Phoebastria albatrus has the greatest potential overlap with fisheries that occur in the shallower waters along continental shelf break and slope regions, e.g., sablefish and Pacific halibut longline fisheries off the coasts of Alaska and British Columbia. Although, overlap between the distribution of birds and fishery effort does not mean that interactions between birds and boats necessarily occur, P. albatrus are known to have been killed in U.S. and Russian longline fisheries for Pacific cod and Pacific halibut. In addition, birds on Torishima have been observed with hooks in their mouths of the style used in Japanese fisheries near the island (ACAP 2009).|\nConservation Actions Underway\nIt is legally protected in Japan, Canada and the USA. A draft recovery plan has been developed (USFWS 2005). Mitigation measures have been established in the Alaska demersal longline fishery and in the Hawaii-based pelagic longline fishery (NOAA 2008). Streamer lines (both heavy weight lines for large boats and lightweight lines for smaller vessels) have been designed to keep birds from longline hooks as they are set, and these are being distributed free to the Alaskan longline fleet (USFWS 2005), though they are not deployed in near-shore waters. In 2006, the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission passed a measure which requires large tuna and swordfish longline vessels (>24m long) to use a combination of two seabird bycatch mitigation measures when fishing north of 23 degrees North. Torishima has been established as a National Wildlife Protection Area. In 1981-1982, native plants were transplanted into the Torishima nesting colony in order to stabilise the nesting habitat and the nest structures. This has enhanced breeding success, with over 60% of eggs now resulting in fledged young. Decoys have been used to attract birds to nest at another site on Torishima since 1993 and the first pair started breeding at this new site in November 1995. The number of chicks fledged from this new colony has increased from one chick in 2004; four chicks in 2005; 13 chicks in 2006; 16 chicks in 2007. In October-November 2007, 35 eggs were laid at this new site (Sato 2009). In 2007, the Japanese government approved a project to translocate chicks from Torishima to Mukojima, 300 km away. All ten chicks of the first translocations in March 2008 fledged (Jacobs 2009). If successful, this project will translocate at least ten chicks per year for five years. Conservation Actions Proposed\nContinue to promote measures designed to protect this species from becoming hooked or entangled by commercial fishing gear. Re-establish birds within historic range as insurance against natural disasters on primary breeding colony. Promote conservation measures for the Minami-kojima population. Continue research into the at-sea distribution and marine habitat use through satellite telemetry studies. Continue land-based management and population monitoring.\n|Citation:||BirdLife International 2012. Phoebastria albatrus. In: IUCN 2012. IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

He repelled the Xiongnu and secured Chinese control over the Tarim Basin region, and was awarded the title of 'Protector General of the Western Regions'. He fought for 31 years.\nControl of the Tarim Basin \nBan Chao, like his predecessors Huo Qubing and Wei Qing from the Former Han Dynasty before him, was effective at expelling the Xiongnu from the Tarim Basin, and brought the various people of the Western Regions under Chinese rule during the second half of the 1st century CE, helping to open and secure the trade routes to the west. He was generally outnumbered, but skillfully played on the divisions among his opponents. The kingdoms of Loulan, Khotan and Kashgar came under Chinese rule.\nBan Chao was recalled to Luoyang, but then sent again to the Western Region area four years later, during the reign of the new emperor Han Zhangdi. He obtained the military help of the Kushan Empire in 84 in repelling the Kangju who were trying to support the rebellion of the king of Kashgar, and the next year in his attack on Turpan, in the eastern Tarim Basin. Ban Chao ultimately brought the whole of the Tarim Basin under Chinese control.\nIn recognition for their support to the Chinese, the Kushans (referred to as Da Yuezhi in Chinese sources) requested, but were denied, a Han princess, even though they had sent presents to the Chinese court. In retaliation, they marched on Ban Chao in 90 CE with a force of 70,000, but, exhausted by the expedition, were finally turned back by the smaller Chinese force. The Yuezhi retreated and paid tribute to the Chinese Empire. (Later, during the Yuanchu period, 114-120 CE, the Kushans sent a military force to install Chenpan, who had been a hostage among them, as king of Kashgar).\nIn 91 CE, Ban Chao finally succeeded in pacifying the Western Regions and was awarded the title of Protector General and stationed at Qiuci (Kucha). A Wuji Colonel was re-established and, commanding five hundred soldiers, stationed in the Kingdom of Nearer Jushi, within the walls of Gaochang, 29 kilometres southeast of Turfan. In 94 CE, Chao proceeded to again attack and defeat Yanqi [Karashahr]. Subsequently, more than fifty kingdoms presented hostages, and submitted to the Interior.\nIn 97 CE Ban Chao sent an envoy, Gan Ying, who reached the Persian Gulf and left the first recorded Chinese account of Europe. Some modern authors have even claimed that Ban Chao advanced to the Caspian Sea, however, this interpretation has been criticized as a misreading.\nIn 102 CE Ban Chao was retired as Protector General of the Western Regions due to age and ill health, and returned to the capital Luoyang at the age of 70, but the following month died there in the 9th month of the 14th Yongyuan year (30th Sept. to 28th Oct., 102). See: Hou Hanshu, chap 77 (sometimes given as chap. 107). Following his death, the power of the Xiongnu in the Western Territories increased again, and subsequent Chinese emperors were never to reach so far to the west.\nA family of historians \nBan Chao also belonged to a family of historians. His father was Ban Biao (3-54 CE) who started the History of the Western Han Dynasty (Hanshu; The Book of Han) in 36, which was completed by his son Ban Gu (32-92) and his daughter Ban Zhao (Ban Chao's brother and sister). Ban Chao was probably the key source for the cultural and socio-economic data on the Western Regions contained in the Hanshu.\nBan Chao's youngest son Ban Yong (\u73ed\u52c7 B\u0101n Y\u014fng) participated in military campaigns with his father and continued to have a central military role in the Tarim Basin into the 120s.\nBan Chao's family \n- Ban Biao (\u73ed\u5f6a; 3-54; father)\nFamous quotes \n- \"If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch the tiger's cub?\" (\u4e0d\u5165\u864e\u7a74\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f97\u864e\u5b50)\n- \"Clear water can not harbor big fish, clean politics (or strict enforcement of regulations) can not foster harmony among the general public\" (\u6c34\u6e05\u7121\u5927\u9b5a\uff0c\u5bdf\u653f\u4e0d\u5f97\u4e0b\u548c)\nBan Chao in idioms \n- See four-character idiom:\n- \"Throw away your writing brush and join the military!\" (\u6295\u7b46\u5f9e\u620e) based on his words \"A brave man has no other plan but to follow Fu and Zhang Qian's footsteps and do something and become somebody in a foreign land.

In art, the term describes both the act and the result, which is called a painting. Paintings may have for their support such surfaces as walls, paper, canvas, wood, glass, lacquer, clay or concrete. Paintings may be decorated with gold leaf, and some modern paintings incorporate other materials including sand, clay, and scraps of paper.\nWhat Is Painting? is the fourth in a series of installations drawn from the Museum's collection of contemporary art. It presents a selection of artworks made since approximately 1965, including a number of recent acquisitions and many works displayed for the first time since the Museum's reopening. A variety of responses to the question \"What is painting?\" are proposed in loose chronological sequence, ranging from ironic to sincere; from figurative to abstract; and from an embrace and creative reimagining of painting's possibilities to a critical engagement with its limits. The installation's title derives from John Baldessari's eponymous painting of 1966\u201368 (with the addition of a question mark), acknowledging the ongoing debates over the practice of painting and its place within contemporary art.\nPainting is a mode of expression, and the forms are numerous.

{"text":"According to news reports, the recent heat wave in California resulted in about 150 deaths. The United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that global warming will exacerbate the problem dramatically, doubling or tripling the number of heat-related fatalities in North American cities in the next decade. The UN is dead wrong, because it assumes what climate researchers call the \u201cStupid People Hypothesis\u201d: that people will simply sit around and fry to death without doing anything to beat the heat.\nGlobal warming or not, our cities are warming, and will continue to do so. Sprawling masonry and blacktop retain heat, and the density of urban construction prevents wind from cooling it off. (Here in D.C., there\u2019s an additional warming effect: waste heat from all the money changing hands.)\nBut heat and heat-related deaths are not synonymous. In fact, in several refereed papers published in recent years, my Virginia colleague Robert Davis and I demonstrated that heat-related deaths have, in aggregate, declined significantly as our cities have warmed. In fact, in a statistical sense, we have completely engineered heat-related mortality out of several of our urban cores, particularly in eastern cities like Philadelphia.\nConsidering every decade of mortality data at once is misleading; examining it decade-by-decade is more informative. When looked at sequentially, the data reveals a remarkable adaptation: as cities have warmed, the \u201cthreshold\u201d temperatures at which mortality begins to increase have also risen \u2014 more than the temperatures of the cities.\nFor example, in Philadelphia in the 1960s, mortality began to increase once the high temperature exceeded 83 degrees. In the 1970s, the mortality threshold rose to the low 90s. In the last decade, there has been little evidence for any threshold at which mortality increases. In other words, people have adapted to their changing climate.\nHow? Instead of simmering, people buy air conditioning. Every level of government warns of the danger of excessive exposure to heat, and people seek out cooler places.\nSocial adaptation can take place very quickly. In mid-July 1995, over 500 people died from an intense weekend heat wave in Chicago. Research by University of Illinois climatologist Michael Palecki, published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society in 2001, shows that a 1999 Chicago heat wave of comparable intensity resulted in only 15 percent as many deaths.\nThis summer\u2019s heat is a bit unusual. Usually, when it\u2019s very hot in the eastern U.S., temperatures are normal or below average in the West, or vice-versa. This year it\u2019s hot everywhere.\nIs history repeating itself, or is global warming at work? It\u2019s hard to say. Several summers in the 1930s were known for intense heat across the nation. Nineteen-thirty was a scorcher: in rural Virginia, far from Washington\u2019s sprawl, people suffered a total of 21 triple-digit days. Even with the excess heat contributed by the growth of the city, Washington currently averages only one 100 degree day per year.\nThe fact is that we cannot completely discriminate between repetitive history and prospective warming when it comes to a single summer. The better place to look for warming is in the winter. Greenhouse-effect theory predicts that the coldest temperatures of winter will rise much more sharply than the hottest ones of summer. And indeed, for the last several decades, winter\u2019s lows have warmed out of proportion to summer\u2019s highs.\nAll of which illustrates the complexity of global warming. Would people accept \u2014 even welcome? \u2014 climate change that greatly alleviated winter discomfort at the cost of slightly higher summer temperatures?\nClearly, people have adapted to the heat. The evidence shows that, the warmer the city, the more quickly its residents adapt. Heat-related deaths are increasing in only one major American city: chilly Seattle. San Francisco and Los Angeles, two other cities that are relatively cool in the summer compared to those to their east, show no change in mortality.\nAs the UN\u2019s climatologists should recognize, heat waves are dangerous when they are rare and unexpected, because people are unfamiliar with them and slow to take appropriate actions to minimize their exposure. As heat waves become more common, we will simply be better prepared for them and incorporate them into our daily lives and routines \u2014 just as the people of Phoenix and Dallas and Houston and New Orleans do, every summer day. Because they\u2019re not stupid.","id":"<urn:uuid:7cc090fe-4c5a-497d-85d8-8ab810906aec>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/spectator.org\/archives\/2006\/08\/23\/urban-heat-urban-legends","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9522523284,"token_count":925,"score":2.859375,"int_score":3}

It is one of the principal damage functions acting on materials along with heat and ultra-violet radiation.2 I think moisture is the key to understanding the performance of buildings in general\u2014and in this particular case\u2014in specific.\nThe consequence of this reduced energy exchange is beginning to be seen all over the place: mold, part load humidity problems, rot, and corrosion. Highly insulated building enclosures with reduced heat gain have low drying potentials and increased interior moisture loads. When they get wet they don\u2019t dry. Stuff is beginning to stink, rot, break and annoy.\nThere are two things to look at here. Levels of insulation and airtight assemblies and heat gain through glazing, roof assemblies and interior loads. Adding insulation and providing airtight assemblies reduces energy flow. That is a good thing right? Well, no\u2014not always. Less energy flow from the inside to the outside the colder things on the outside of the building get in the winter. The colder these things, the wetter these things get and the wetter they stay. This is not good. Less energy flow from the outside to the inside in the summer and the less heat that is generated inside in the summer the less the air-conditioning system runs. This is a good thing right? Well, no\u2014not always. We create something called \u201cthe part load humidity problem.\u201d\nHigher Levels of Thermal Resistance\nHow do we dry wet wood? We kiln dry it. We heat the wood so that the water in the wood is warmer than its surroundings. We add energy to the water and it evaporates. There is a huge exchange of energy. When we put warm wet coffee beans in a room with very cold surfaces we call it freeze-drying. The moisture leaves the coffee beans and accumulates on the cold surfaces. There is a huge exchange of energy. The greater the rate of energy exchange the greater the rate of moisture movement. Drying cannot happen with out an exchange of energy.\nWhen my Mom and Dad bought their first house in Toronto, Canada in 1957 there was no insulation in the walls and the house was leaky to air\u2014it had a high air change driven by a traditional chimney. We lived in a 1,200 square foot house and in January, when the outside temperature dropped to 0 degrees F., Momma cranked up the 300,000 Btu oil furnace to maintain an interior temperature of 70 degrees F. The energy flow across the building enclosure was enormous, but oil was cheap, and we were comfortable and happy. The energy flow was so enormous the building enclosure was simultaneously kiln dried and freeze-dried. In fact, the drying potential was so high, we were uncomfortably dry. As a result Poppa insisted that the furnace have a new fangled gadget attached to it\u2014called a humidifier. How things have changed.\nWell what changed? We\u2019ve begun to insulate\u2014and insulate exceptionally well\u2014and we\u2019re getting the assemblies \u201ctighter\u201d to air change and convection. That results in two things\u2014less energy exchange therefore less drying potential\u2014and things on the exterior side of the enclosure are colder in the winter. Things being colder on the outside lead to something most folks don\u2019t consider. Many building materials are hygroscopic (Figure 1). This means they absorb moisture based on relative humidity. Even more strangely, they don\u2019t care about vapor pressure except if it affects relative humidity. This is a big deal. In fact it is a huge deal.\nFigure 1: Sorption Curve for Common Building Materials\u2014Note that moisture content goes up as relative humidity goes up. There is no temperature dependence or vapor pressure dependence except where temperature affects relative humidity or where vapor pressure affects relative humidity.\nQuick, snap quiz, psychrometric chart stuff\u2026.as the temperature drops, and vapor pressure is kept constant, what happens to the relative humidity? Buzz\/Clang\/Bell. Yes, folks, you are correct, the relative humidity goes up. The implications are staggering. Just making things on the outside of your building cold, hygroscopic things, makes them wetter. Period, end of story. But, but, the moisture content of the outside air in the wintertime is low. Yes, grasshopper, it is, but its\u2019 relative humidity is high. The amount of moisture in the absolute sense is low, but in the relative sense it is high. And hygroscopic materials don\u2019t care about the absolute sense; they only care about the relative sense. Why? Second Law stuff\u2014isn\u2019t it always?\nCheck out Photograph 1. Nice, normal, everyday type of house in Cleveland, OH. Twenty years old, no insulation in the wall cavities, built in 1965 (yes, the photograph was taken in 1985\u2014we did have camera\u2019s back then...). The house was perfectly happy at this point for twenty years. Then the homeowner decides to do something crazy, he decides to insulate the exterior walls to save energy and has the cavities blown with dry cellulose. What a dumb idea in 1985 eh? But, never the less, it was a beautiful job, no voids, yes it can be done, and yes it was done. No voids, no convection (Photograph 2\u2014notice how young this engineer once was). Next thing you know, the paint falls off, and the siding gets smelly, moldy and begins to decay (Photograph 3). Huh? The insulation did this? Yup. The drying potential is reduced due to the addition of the insulation so that the moisture entering the cladding assembly from the exterior due to rain and capillarity does not evaporate and this is further exacerbated by the colder siding having a higher local relative humidity and thus a higher equilibrium moisture content due to the sorption properties of wood. Bummer. How to fix this? Easy, wedges were used to create a gap at the overlaps of the siding reducing capillary uptake at the laps and increasing evaporation despite the cladding being colder (Photograph 4). This early lesson in sorption and drying potentials taught this engineer to drain and back-ventilate claddings \u2013especially those on highly insulated assemblies (Photograph 5).\nPhotograph 1: The \u201cTypical House\u201d\u2014Built in 1965 in Cleveland, OH with no cavity insulation in the exterior wood frame walls. No problems for twenty years. Insulation added to exterior walls in 1985 and within one year the paint begins to fail.\nPhotograph 2: Retrofit Cellulose Cavity Insulation\u2014Dry blown cellulose packed into exterior wood frame walls. Injected from the exterior at top of cavity. This author, very young at the time, amazed at how well the insulation worked. Cavities were dry when opened.\nPhotograph 3: Wet Cladding\u2014Problems with mold and decay were worse on north and east elevations. Problems with peeling paint were worse on west and south elevations. Solar radiation cycled the cladding moisture content more on the west and south elevations stressing the paint. UV cross-linked the paint making it less flexible. Less flexibility, more movement on the south and the west led to the peeling paint. Less energy on the north and the east led to the mold and the decay.\nPhotograph 4: Wedgie\u2014So simple and so obvious. After the problem is understood. Wedges created gaps that reduced capillary uptake of surface water, promoted drainage and back ventilation.\nPhotograph 5: Drainage and Ventilation Matt Behind Cladding\u2014This is easy for new construction and re-cladding. Existing buildings are going to be a problem. Don\u2019t say you weren\u2019t warned.\nLet\u2019s extend this discussion to cavity insulation in general. The same thing happens to the cavity side of sheathing when we insulate cavities. It gets worse when the cavities also have no air flow or convection.3 Sheathings get colder. If the sheathing is hygroscopic, its equilibrium moisture content also goes up. Why take the risk? Insulate on the exterior of the sheathing. This makes the problem go away. The risk is so high in cold climates that folks are no longer insulating the cavities in steel stud walls in places like Ottawa and Montreal\u2014all of the insulation goes on the outside.\nThis is why insulating sheathing is pretty much the name of the game for highly insulated wall assemblies\u2014or at a minimum claddings should be back ventilated and back-drained\u2014or better, do both. This is easy for new construction. The problem is what to do with the existing building stock? What are we going to do if oil ever goes above $100\/barrel? Dumb comment. Yes, but now we have a real problem. Folks cannot just go and blow\/spray\/fill cavities with a bunch of insulation without appreciating the consequences. This is not just a cold climate problem. It is a problem everywhere. In fact it gets worse when we go far south. Read on McDuff\u2026\nReduced Heat Gain\nI am going to let you in on a little secret that us mechanical engineers don\u2019t often share with the rest of the world\u2014air conditioning systems only dehumidify when they run. Yup, when they don\u2019t run, they don\u2019t dehumidify. If there is no load, there is no dehumidification.4\nWell, just make them run longer. How? They still make the air cold no matter how you run them. That is good if you need cold air. But what if you don\u2019t need cold air? What if you only need dry air? Well, you still have to make the air cold to get it to drop its water, and when you are done you still have cold air. So now what? Well, you have to heat it back up if you want to use it. This is sometimes called cooling with re-heat. There are other tricks we can do\u2014read on\u2014but at the end of the day we have to add energy back to the air that we cooled. There is no other practical way to do it.\nIt gets worse when we over-ventilate with humid air\u2014especially when it is cloudy and not so hot. Now all you are doing is bringing in moisture. But you are doing it when there is not much of a load\u2014not much of a \u201csensible load\u201d (heat gain across the enclosure and heat gain from lights and appliances and people\u2014the load you can \u201csense\u201d) to run the air conditioning system. This moisture that you are bringing in with the ventilation air is also a \u201cload\u201d\u2014but it is a different kind of load that we have pretty much been ignoring up till now and getting away with it. The operative phrase to note is: \u201cgetting away with it.\u201d Mechanical engineers like me call this the \u201chidden load\u201d or the \u201clatent load\u201d (as in \u201clatent defect\u201d or \u201chidden defect\u201d) and our heads explode when we try to explain this problem to the indoor air crazies who think that only dilution is the solution to indoor pollution. I mean how can too much outside air be bad?5 Arrargah\u2026\nTo take the water out of the air you need to use energy. To make the air comfortable\/useful the air can\u2019t be too cold after you have taken the water out of it. Typically heat (energy) has to be added back to the air. Traditionally this heat (energy) was available through lousy glazing systems, too much glass, black roofs with no insulation, poorly insulated walls, energy inefficient lights, and crappy appliances. Well, this traditional \u201cre-heat\u201d due to inefficiency and poor practice is disappearing. Now we are stuck. If we don\u2019t warm up the air after we dry it we are going to get into trouble. We haven\u2019t been, and we are getting into trouble. The buildings are now getting too cold or too humid or worse, both.\nAh, this is easy you say. Just make the air conditioning systems smaller\u2014\u201cright size\u201d them. Don\u2019t make me scream. I am getting tired of being told by energy weenies that my equipment is too big.6 I still have to satisfy the \u201cfull load\u201d requirement. If you make the equipment too small it doesn\u2019t satisfy the cooling requirements under full load. Let the people be uncomfortable you say. People should suffer you say; we have had it too good you say. Yeah, sure, another greenie weenie value judgment that also makes me scream. I don\u2019t think we should suffer. I like it being good. I don\u2019t have a problem with using energy. I have a problem with wasting energy. Until now we have gotten pretty good at dealing with this part-load problem with face-bypass, run-around coils, hot gas bypass and heat pipes but we have reached our limits.\nBuilding enclosures have gotten so good, glazing systems so good, interior load management so good, that we can\u2019t use the same equipment to handle the \u201csensible load\u201d and the \u201clatent load.\u201d Did I mention just how good the glazing systems have become? Did I mention the low SHGC thing? We used to just install air conditioners and only cared about making it cold inside. We used one piece of equipment to handle the sensible and latent load. The reason this worked is that the latent load was small compared to the sensible load. Not any more. The sensible load has gotten smaller big time. And, much to my chagrin, the latent load has gone up due to over ventilation. The old systems can\u2019t handle the new sensible to latent ratios. We have to separate the two loads.\nWe need separate systems for the sensible load and the latent load. This is a big deal and it results from the low heat gain in the modern enclosure. In other words energy conservation and good construction practice is biting us on the butt. We sometimes refer to this second separate latent load control system as supplemental dehumidification\u2014and we need it when we have a low heat gain enclosure and efficient lighting and appliances. Others call it \u201cpreconditioning\u201d of outside air since the largest component of the latent load is the ventilation air or the outside air. Whatever you call it, we need this second system. We don\u2019t often get it and it hurts us.\nBut, but these systems use energy. Yes, as the saying goes\u2014there is no thermodynamic free lunch. You need to use energy to make air cold and you need to use energy to make air dry. We have been very good at making air cold. We now have to get good at making air dry. Think of it this way. For every 100 units of energy you save on the efficiency and on the cooling side, you are going to have to give back about 20 units of energy to be dry. You are still 80 units ahead. Problem is, if you are greedy and want the entire 100 units your building fails and your occupants get very uncomfortable and probably very annoyed.\nIt is pretty amazing to me but the hotel industry figured this out first. They pretty much had the problem first, so it stands to reason that they would also figure it out first. Think about the typical hotel room. The drapes are pretty much closed all the time, the room is empty during the day, and you know the unit has been sized for the full load, with the drapes open, and the room full, and everything on and you know that someone in some bureaucracy somewhere wants way too much outside air. Most of the time your latent load dwarfs your sensible load. So what do you do? You reduce the amount of outside air by installing timers on the exhaust fans and you pretty much ignore the faceless bureaucrat. Then you only run the through-wall unit to control the temperature (i.e. make it the \u201csensible\u201d system) and install a dehumidifier in each unit control the humidity (the \u201clatent\u201d system) (Photograph 6). A pretty primitive but effective \u201cfix.\u201d In new design we just \u201chide\u201d the dehumidifier better\u2014or better still make it part of the ventilation system.\nPhotograph 6: Hotel Room Fix\u2014The through-wall unit controls the temperature (the \u201csensible\u201d system). The dehumidifier controls the humidity (the \u201clatent\u201d system).\nGuess where this technology is now making an impact\u2014condos and apartments. Small houses are next. We are already separating the latent from the sensible on most commercial design\u2014after all it is the sensible thing to do.\nNorth versus South\nSo how come it is worse in the south than the north? Besides the south loosing the Civil War? In the north, it still gets cold and the outside cold air is pretty dry\u2014and walls tend to dry to the outside in the north - so the size of the moisture drying \u201csink\u201d so to speak\u2014has not changed. But in the south, walls also dry to the inside\u2014and if the inside is humid because of the part load problem\u2014the walls stay wetter because the moisture drying \u201csink\u201d is smaller. Additionally, in the south the moisture drive from the exterior into the wall is greater while at the same time the moisture drive from the wall into the interior is smaller as compared to the corresponding drives in opposite directions in the north. Let me translate. It is easier to get wet from the outside in the south than it is from the inside in them north. It is also easier to dry to the outside in the north than it is to dry to the inside in the south. With less energy available, it gets worse in the south faster than in the north.\nGood air conditioning design leads to dry interiors and dry interiors allow walls to dry to the inside. Part load humidity problems lead to wetter walls. Higher levels of thermal insulation and lower heat gain lead to part load humidity problems. Not good.\nOK, everybody relax. We want and we need much higher levels of thermal control (air tight, insulated assemblies) everywhere. We just have to be smart about it. We want and we need ultra efficient glazing, lights, appliances, and reflective surfaces everywhere. We just have to be smart about it. And we want and we need the right amount of outside air whenever we need it. We just have to be smart about it. This is neither expensive nor difficult, just different. We have to modify our building enclosure and mechanical system paradigms. Get used to it or be steamrolled by the change.\nInsulate on the outside. Back ventilate and drain your cladding. Separate your sensible load from you latent load. Don\u2019t over ventilate. Existing buildings are going to be a bear. And have a nice day.\nYes, I know, pretty arrogant for a relative youngster to say. I am in my 50\u2019s, but when you get to this age you spend as much time looking back as you do looking forward. My mentors tell me that it helps with perspective. It has been said that in order to understand the future you have to understand the past. I am not so ambitious. I am only thinking of today. I think in order to understand the present you have to understand the past\u2026\nSomeone once said that 80 percent of all building related durability problems are due to three principal damage functions (water, heat and UV radiation) with 80 percent of the 80 percent being water. I don\u2019t know who said this. Can someone help me out? I might have just made it up, but I have been saying it so long I no longer remember if I did or not. Aren\u2019t footnotes great\u2026\nAir flow\u2014air change and convection\u2014increases energy exchange therefore increases drying potential. My Canadian friends heads are now going to explode because they have been taught that air leakage leads to \u201cwetting\u201d from interior sources. Yes, in extreme climates with high interior moisture loads. Think humidified buildings in Canada. Not everywhere else. Come visit the United States, the dollar exchange now works for you and air leakage improves drying potentials.\nSensible load. I know you knew that I knew this, but some of the email I have been getting from you folks has been quite picky, which is good, but I want to head off the obvious emails, so continue to be picky, but not on this\u2026\nSome folks don\u2019t seem to care about the energy thing either. I mean health is paramount and we should always err on the side of caution. How can we argue against health? Easy, when the \u201chealthy\u201d measures are \u201cunhealthy.\u201d Over-ventilation can be unhealthy\u2014and energy wasteful. Read on. This is leading to interesting discussions in the Standard 62 committees. Apparently the Standard 62 committees are not about energy. Apparently energy security is not a 62 problem nor is climate change nor are operating costs. Apparently, it is some other committee\u2019s problem. How about the energy committee (Standard 90.1)? Except that the energy committee does not want to touch ventilation. Cowards. My insider\u2019s perspective (on 62.2 at least) is that there is a lot of mileage to be made by scaring people about under ventilation, and folks are rising to the occasion. Unfortunately, over ventilation in hot humid climates and in mixed humid climates has led to more indoor air problems due to mold resulting from part load issues than under ventilation anywhere else\u2014in my not so humble opinion. And speaking of health and under ventilation where are all the dead bodies? Where is the causal link between health and specific levels of specific indoor contaminants? In my not so humble opinion all of the rates have been just wild assed guesses without a sound epidemiological basis. But the resulting mold from over ventilation is real and demonstrable. Just to make it clear, I have been guessing at \u201crates\u201d as well, but I have not been afraid to call them \u201cguesses\u201d or tried to hide the guesses behind a lot of bad science. And one more thing, this LEED stuff is making me crazy, the part where you get extra points when you ventilate at an even higher rate than what Standard 62 calls for\u2026what a bunch of green sustainability hypocrisy\u2026doesn\u2019t anyone at the US Green Building Council know anything about energy and part load humidity?","id":"<urn:uuid:2b82307d-66d9-4c83-aa8d-50b37690a3e2>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.buildingscience.com\/documents\/insights\/bsi-028-energy-flow-across-enclosures?topic=doctypes\/insights","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9502243996,"token_count":4883,"score":2.703125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Oct. 9, 1998 COLUMBIA, Mo.--Ducks, geese and bald eagles soaring over areas the size of small towns are envisioned when talking about federally protected wetlands, not areas that are maybe as big as a small swimming pool and apparently void of life. University of Missouri-Columbia Professor Ray Semlitsch is trying to change that view and explain the importance of smaller wetlands before they are managed out of existence.\n\"Large wetlands are beautiful and need to be protected, but for some animal species such as frogs, toads and salamanders, it is small wetlands that support greater species diversity,\" said Semlitsch, who along with his graduate research assistant, Russ Bodie, recently published their research in Conservation Biology. \"These smaller, temporary wetlands--because they are dry at certain times during the year--are much harder to appreciate than vast marsh areas. But without these smaller wetlands, it is very possible that much of the animal and plant life that make wetlands rich, productive habitats would not survive. We need to worry about the conservation of smaller wetlands as well as the larger ones.\"\nSmall wetlands currently are defined as being less than 4 hectares, or about 8 to 9 acres. The majority of the nation's wetlands are much smaller than might be imagined, closer to 1 to 2 acres and sometimes as small as several square yards. These small wetlands may comprise the majority of wetlands in the United States and help support a vast diversity of wetland species. However, unlike the large wetlands, these smaller areas are not protected to the same extent.\nRecently, the Army Corp of Engineers, which manages wetlands of all sizes throughout the United States, drafted regulations that will change the way wetlands are managed in the future. They have put off any change in management regulations until April, but the MU researchers argue that the changes in the regulations could manage these smaller wetlands out of existence.\n\"Right now we can't detect losses of small wetlands by satellite imagery, a technique used to assess environmental change,\" Bodie said. \"We lose thousands of acres each year in wetlands and these smaller ones are not even taken into account. Yet, they play a vital role in the ecosystem and support a great variety of organisms.\"\nResearch done by Semlitsch and Bodie has indicated that when some individuals of a species move between wetlands, this increases their chances of survival. By populating many different wetlands, various species thrive, even during drought years when some wetlands are dry. When smaller wetlands are destroyed, the chances of survival for many species' populations may decrease dramatically because distances between individual wetlands become longer, making movement between wetlands more difficult. These small wetland breeding sites for amphibians are especially critical in light of purported world-wide declines, Semlitsch said.\nWetlands in general also have direct benefits to humans as they filter out chemicals and silt, buffer lands from flooding, and are a favorite of hunters and fishers. They also are very costly and difficult to develop for construction or other purposes.\nOther social bookmarking and sharing tools:\nThe above story is reprinted from materials provided by University Of Missouri, Columbia.\nNote: Materials may be edited for content and length.

In water, it dissolves into Na+ and Cl\u2212 ions.\nThe word chloride can also refer to a chemical compound in which one or more chlorine atoms are covalently bonded in the molecule.

{"text":"- November 15th, 2008\n- Derek Robertson\n- Comments: 7 Comments \u00bbTags: Consolarium, Endless Ocean, games based learning, Wii\nEndless Ocean for the Nintendo Wii was one of those games that immediately caught my eye. A wonderful world in which the player can become immersed in a rich, vibrant and somewhat hypnotically therapeutic underwater world. I\u2019ve written about how I thought it might be used to drive learning before but my initial ideas have been put into place and extended beyond recognition by some really creative teachers.\nLast week I went with Margaret Cassidy from Stirling Council to Cowie PS to see a teacher that was using Endless Ocean with her class:\nMrs Bullivant and her class of P.6 children treated me to an afternoon of sheer joy. I walked in to a class that had been turned into an underwater world that was awash with a tide of enthusiastic and industrious learnning.\n- Streamers of various shades of blue were hung from two lines that criss-crossed the class.From these lines also hung starfish, sharks and other underwater creatures that the children had made.\n- The Wii was hooked up to the whiteboard and the gameplay was integral to the learning.\n- The children were divided into \u2018dive teams\u2019 and their \u2018dive leader\u2019 had to manage certain aspects of how the children worked together.\n- Children were engaged with a teacher led leson that investigated buoyancy.\n- Children were searching the web to find out more about some of the creatures that they discovered in the game.\n- A spreadsheet activity detailing the range of creatures that they had discovered was in place.\n- A shipwreck (created by the janitor) was sitting in the class. This helped drive much of the creative writing work.\n- The children created treasure maps and were using these to look at grid references.\n- Mermaids were created in art and design and very lifelike they were too!\n- Reference books were in great demand when I was in the class and the initial stimulus of the game appeared to drive a real interest for what could be found in the complementary resource that was the book.\n- Children actively encouraged to measure exactly how long 7 metres is as a result of finding out that that was how long a Great White Shark was.\nThis was just a wonderful visit and an example of what learning in class can be. Yes we need creative teachers to lead this but isn\u2019t that what we are meant to be. The work that was in evidence in this class was delightful to witness and further cemented my ideas of the possibilities of sandbox games such as Endless Ocean.\nCategories Stirling Council","id":"<urn:uuid:ed02b25b-582c-477f-af77-6a012b479875>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/blogs.educationscotland.gov.uk\/consolarium\/2008\/11\/15\/endless-ocean-and-endless-learning-in-stirling\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9867492318,"token_count":553,"score":2.546875,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Children are willing to ask one parent and then the next to get the desired answer. Parental communication is key to combating this divisive strategy.\nChildren determine from an early age which parent they should ask for permission in which circumstance. I can illustrate this with the example of my own family. If the request involved some degree of daring, risk, or danger, they always approached Dad, the one more likely to allow a bareback ride on the horse or a run down a black diamond ski slope.\nWhen it came to social events, they made the intelligent choice to come to Mom. I am \u2014 and always have been \u2014 more of a social butterfly than dear old Dad. This division of labor in regard to granting permission is logical and harmless. The problems begin when a child asks one parent, is denied permission, and then asks the other parent, looking for an override of the first ruling \u2014 Divide and Conquer.\nIf this is allowed in your family, it will definitely be disruptive. When Divide and Conquer is successful, Mom and Dad find themselves distracted and in conflict with each other. That leaves the child free to disregard the first parent\u2019s decision.\nTo combat the Divide and Conquer strategy, you need to communicate. Find out if there has been an initial answer given to your child\u2019s request. If the other parent has already responded, it is best to let the first answer hold. If you find that the two of you are continually disagreeing, it would be best to simply address your child\u2019s request by saying, \u201cYour Dad and I will have to talk about it.\u201d It is always good to have a united front or, as I like to say, to be singing off the same songsheet.\nFor Your Reflection:\nHave you ever been the victim of a Divide and Conquer strategy?","id":"<urn:uuid:1707c04d-9f53-40ca-9a31-5bf2a56449ac>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/faithlifewomen.com\/2012\/08\/divide-and-conquer\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9465836883,"token_count":374,"score":2.859375,"int_score":3}
{"text":"The Neighbor Squirrel\nThese busy fluffballs have lost their fear of most predators - and they help plant pecan trees.\nBy Sheryl Smith-Rodgers\nHave you ever watched an eastern fox squirrel (Sciurus niger) bury an acorn or pecan? A nuzzle here, another there, then he hurriedly pushes the leaves and grass over the site before scampering up the closest tree. Minutes later, he's back with another nut. Over the course of three months, that industrious squirrel can bury several thousand pecans. Come winter, when food's scarce, he'll find them again with his excellent sense of smell. Some will escape his appetite, though, and sprout into saplings, which is how many native nut trees get planted.\nEastern fox squirrels - the state's most common and wide-ranging squirrel and a popular game animal, too - occur in forests and riparian habitats. They also easily adapt to cities and neighborhoods, where they've lost most of their fear of natural predators.\n\"Playing the call of a red-tailed hawk didn't phase squirrels on campus,\" reports Bob McCleery, a wildlife lecturer at Texas A&M University, who has studied urban squirrels in College Station. \"When we played a coyote call in the Navasota river bottom, a squirrel immediately flattened itself in the crotch of a tree for a good five minutes.\"\nWhen agitated, fox squirrels - whose fur closely resembles that of a gray fox - bark and jerk their long, bushy tails, which they use for balance when scampering on utility lines and other high places. Tails provide warmth and protection, too. \"In the summer, I've seen them lying down with their tails over their heads to block the sun,\" McCleery says.","id":"<urn:uuid:3cb858ec-4357-48a5-9912-c7929ec225af>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/tpwmagazine.com\/archive\/2008\/jan\/scout3\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9645190239,"token_count":370,"score":3.296875,"int_score":3}

How is Greek mythology evident in our world today? What allusions are there to these stories? What is the origin of Greek mythology?PowerPoint Presentation: What is a myth? A myth is a story, created collectively by a whole people or society over a period of time once believed to be true, that embodies some of the wisdom and truth valued by that society. These stories may help to explain why the world works the way it does, to provide a rationale for customs and observances, to establish set rituals for ceremonies, and to predict what happens to individuals after death. Alert: On the Test!PowerPoint Presentation: Types of myths Cosmic myths Concern creation and the end of the world. Theistic myths Concern gods such as Zeus or Athena. Hero myths Concern individuals such as Heracles, Perseus, and Achilles. Place\/Object myths Concern items or places such as the golden fleece; the Trojan warPowerPoint Presentation: Who created myths? Ancient Greeks, Romans, Aztecs, ancient Egyptians, Norse Vikings, North American Indians, Chinese, inhabitants of India\u2014every ancient civilization\u2014developed a system of mythology to explain their world. Many answer questions such as: Who am I? What is this world around me? Why am I here? What is the purpose of life?PowerPoint Presentation: Purposes of Mythology Myths grant continuity and stability to a culture. Myths present guidelines for living. Myths justify a culture\u2019s activities. Myths give meaning to life. Myths explain the unexplainable. Myths offer role models. Alert: On the Test!PowerPoint Presentation: Legacy of the ancient Greeks Greek empire 2500 years ago Science and mathematics: Aristotle, Archimedes System of medicine Philosophy shaped western civilization and thought Arts, drama, poetry, sculpture, literature, architecture Law, government, democracy developed in Athens Military tacticsPowerPoint Presentation: Map of ancient Greece Important Cities Mt. Olympus Troy Delphi Thebes Athens Sparta CretePowerPoint Presentation: Influence of the Romans In the last century before the birth of Christ, the Roman empire expanded and became more powerful than Greece. The Romans were greatly influenced by the Greeks and linked the Greek stories to their own gods until both mythologies were almost the same. Therefore, there are both Latin and Greek names for the gods. For example: Zeus (Greek) is also Jupiter (Roman\/Latin).PowerPoint Presentation: The ancient soap opera Storytellers would tell these stories in the theater. This story telling is an example of \u201coral tradition.\u201d Each time a story was retold, new details would be added. Stories of the Iliad and the Odyssey , both epics of adventure and war, took 24 hours to read. People would bring food and drink and stay for entire performances.PowerPoint Presentation: Why study mythology? Read very interesting, fun, and engaging stories See how less sophisticated people attempted to deal with questions and problems of their world Detect allusions to Greek mythology in writers such as Shakespeare to the present Identify allusions to Greek myths in modern products, vocabulary, and businesses Recognize common archetypes in literature ?

{"text":"Fertilizer Facts: April 1997, Number 15\nResponse of Oat to Water and Nitrogen\nLand Resources and Environmental Sciences Dept.\nMontana State University\nNitrogen (N) is the most common nutrient that limits oat production in Montana. Deficiency symptoms are frequently characterized by general chlorosis (yellowing) of leaves and a reduction in overall plant vigor and growth. Oat N deficiency symptoms, as with other cereal grains, will most often appear in the early to late spring depending on severity. Once present, symptoms become more severe through vegetative growth stages. At flowering, N deficient plants are stunted and have fewer tillers and smaller heads than healthy plants. Grain yield is reduced primarily through a reduction in kernels per head and head density.\nNitrogen typically represents a grower's largest fertilizer input cost. Current fertilizer N recommendations in Montana are based on an average relationship between N requirement (NR) and estimated yield potential [Yield potential (bu\/a) x 1.1 = NR (lbs\/a)] (Table 1). The recommendation assumes 1.1 lbs N\/a are needed to produce each bushel of grain. However, this relation may vary with growing season and the yield potential at an individual site. Since yield potential is most closely associated with available water (stored soil water + growing season precipitation), we were interested in determining the effects of available water supply on the N requirement and oat yield potential.\nField experiments were conducted on a Lohmiller silty clay loam (Ustic Torrifluvents) at the Southern Agricultural Research Center near Huntley during 1993 and 1994. Initial soil N levels (0-36 in. depth) were 15 and 22 lbs\/a in 1993 and 1994. Field experiments were previously seeded to barley. A line-source sprinkler irrigation system was used to establish a water gradient in the field. Monida oats were planted in early April at 18 seeds per square foot. Stripped at right angles to the water gradient were six fertilizer N levels (0, 20, 40, 80, 120, 160 lbs N\/a). The combined treatments produced a field site with a wide range of available water and N conditions.\nTable 1. Predicted N requirements for oats with growing season water.\n|Growing season water||Yield potential||Available N requirement||N:yield ratio|\nAs expected, available water increased oat yield potential and the response to N. Under high water stress, the response to N was small and yield potential was low, producing a comparatively flat curve. As water conditions improved, the response to N increased, producing a steeper curve that reached a higher plateau (Figure 1). Yield potential at the plateau levels, or where N was no longer limiting yields, were similar for the two growing seasons. However, oat yields without N fertilizer were higher in 1994 than 1993. This difference may have been a result of greater N mineralization from organic matter in 1994, resulting in less N deficiency where no fertilizer N was applied.\nMaximum economic yield (MEY) was defined as the point along the yield-N curves (Figure 1) where increases in N no longer paid for themselves through higher yield (< 1 bushel increase in yield resulted from 4 lbs additional N), or where dollars returned from N was maximized. Maximum economic yields were generally within 2% of the theoretical maximum, hence they provide a good estimate of yield potential. The MEY-available water relationships (Figure 2) indicate that yield potential increased linearly with water in both 1993 and 1994. The relationships indicate that it takes approximately 4 to 5 in. of water to produce the first bushel of oat, and thereafter yield increases 12 to 14 bu\/a with each inch of additional water.\nAvailable N requirements (soil N + fertilizer N) for MEY increased linearly with water for both growing seasons. The slopes of the lines for the two seasons were similar and indicate that N requirements increased approximately 8 lbs N with each inch of additional water. However, the intercepts for the lines differ for the two seasons. As a result, it took approximately 35 to 40 lbs\/a less N in 1994 to achieve MEY than in 1993 at similar water levels. Background soil N analysis levels for the two seasons were similar. However, barley residue from the preceding crop was burned prior to seeding the 1994 oat crop. This likely enhanced organic N mineralization and resulted in the lower calculated N requirement. Typically, most cereal growers do not burn their residue, hence under most situations the upper line in Figure 3 is probably the better predictor of fertilizer N needs. Using this approach, sufficient fertilizer N should be applied to achieve 60 lbs available N\/a where 8 inches of available water (soil water + rainfall) is expected during the growing season. If water conditions improve, N application is increased approximately 8 lbs\/a per inch increase in available water.\nEdited by Jeff Jacobsen, Extension Soil Scientist","id":"<urn:uuid:9602c7df-0543-4d69-86ae-9dc0a1d13c7a>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/landresources.montana.edu\/fertilizerfacts\/15_response_of_oat_to_water_and_nit.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9560586214,"token_count":1013,"score":3.25,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Idaho State University researchers study newly discovered earthquake fault in Idaho\u2019s Sawtooth Mountains\nPosted September 28, 2010\nWhile looking at a highly detailed new topographic image of Idaho\u2019s Sawtooth Range, Idaho State University geosciences professor Glenn Thackray had an \"eureka moment\" when he discovered a previously unknown active earthquake fault about 65 miles, as the crow flies, from Boise.\nThe researchers examined a Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) image. LIDAR is a remote sensing system used to collect topographic data with aircraft-mounted lasers capable of recording elevation measurements at a rate of 25,000 pulses per second and can have a vertical precision of about six inches. The images can be displayed so they don't show an area's vegetation. Four years ago while doing some research on glaciers in the Sawtooth Range, Thackray was examining a high-resolution, \"bare-earth\" LIDAR image of the mountains: this is when he noticed a line running through the image in the vicinity of Redfish Lake.\n\"The black line stood out and I thought that it had to be an earthquake fault,\" Thackray said. \"It was long suspected that there was an active fault in the Sawtooths, but without the LIDAR technology it would have been exceptionally hard to find.\"\nSince that time, ISU researchers have been on the ground documenting the fault that is at least 25 miles long and could be as long as 40 miles. It is located on the eastern edge of the range and comes within about five miles from the town of Stanley. A portion of it runs through the upper end of Redfish Lake. It runs along the range approximately from near Stanley Lake to at least as far south as Petitt Lake.\n\u201cThe reason this discovery is so important is that it is within the heavily visited areas of the Sawtooth National Recreation area, very close to the town of Stanley, and within 65 miles of Idaho\u2019s largest city, Boise, and the most populated area in the state,\u201d Thackray said. \u201cWe would like to know how big the earthquakes are along this fault and how active it is.\u201d\nThackray emphasized that the fault is cause for concern, but not alarm, for visitors to and residents of the Stanley-Sawtooth area, and to the residents of the Wood River or Boise valleys. The discovery may have implications for land-use and emergency planning, and perhaps building codes. Depending on the magnitude of a potential earthquake, it could do damage to surrounding areas.\nThere are few major, active faults in Idaho. Idaho\u2019s three other major faults run along the base of the Lost River Range (where the famous Borah Peak magnitude 7.3 earthquake, the largest ever recorded in Idaho, occurred in 1983), the Lemhi Range and the Beaverhead Range. Faults are break in the earth\u2019s crust, along which rocks and the earth move. Typically, the earth is moving up on one side of the fault, and moving down on the other.\n\"It's the movement of the rocks that are important. That is what creates an earthquake hazard,\" Thackray said.\nAfter discovering the fault on the LIDAR image and then confirming its existence on the ground, ISU researchers had to determine whether it was an active fault, defined as a fault that has featured an earthquake within the last 10,000 years. Determining whether the fault was active was a challenge for the researchers because most of the fault is located within the Sawtooth Wilderness and Recreation Area.\n\"Normally, to test a fault you could take in a Cat or backhoe and dig up sediment and rock and use carbon dating to date the occurrence of previous activity,\" Thackray said. \"But we couldn\u2019t do that because the fault is in a wilderness area.\"\nThis is where a little luck and scientific serendipity came into play. Other ISU researchers, biological sciences professor Bruce Finney, postdoctoral researcher Mark Shapley, and ISU geosciences graduate student Eric Johnson, were doing lake sediment core sampling of lakes in the Sawtooths, including Redfish Lake, to study the historical record of sockeye salmon returning to the area. While drilling through the sediment in the upper portion of Redfish Lake the researchers hit levels where there were landslide deposits interrupted the regular accumulation of sediment deposits.\n\"We were able to date the occurrence of the most recent fault activity by using those drilling samples from the large landslides in Redfish Lake,\" Thackray said.\n\"There is a lot that we still don\u2019t know about this fault, but our studies have revealed the outline of its history,\" he added.","id":"<urn:uuid:b4b03979-f5ce-4753-9873-392b1e355912>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www2.isu.edu\/headlines\/?p=2781","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9650117755,"token_count":982,"score":2.90625,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Inflammation is a necessary component of the immune system\u2019s fight against infections and the repair of damaged tissues\u2014but problems can arise if the fire won\u2019t subside.\nAsthma, cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and even depression have been linked to a constant activation of the inflammatory response. It\u2019s not an easy condition to treat, either, because its causes include obesity, stress, and pollution, among others. As a result, Wendy Demark-Wahnefried, Ph.D., the Webb Endowed Chair of Nutrition Sciences, and many other UAB researchers are investigating ways to control inflammation on an individual basis.\nThey\u2019re not the only ones searching for a solution. Several high-profile celebrities have been touting \u201canti-inflammatory\u201d diets as a cure. These diets call for eating lots of fruits and vegetables, decreasing consumption of processed carbohydrates, replacing fats and proteins containing omega-6 with their omega-3 counterparts such as fish, and using olive oil instead of other oils.\nLogic and Loss\nIt\u2019s logical: If inflammation causes certain diseases, then eating foods that combat inflammation should prevent those diseases. But according to Demark-Wahnefried, these popular \u201canti-inflammatory\u201d diets are missing one critical factor: weight control. \u201cWe know adipose tissue (body fat) has a great deal to do with inflammation,\u201d she says. \u201cIt produces all kinds of cytokines and adipokines, which are signaling molecules that can drive inflammation.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all spin,\u201d says Demark-Wahnefried. \u201cWhat they seem to be preaching is pretty much mainstream. They\u2019ve just repackaged it.\u201d\nThe bright side is that changes in eating habits can lead to weight loss, producing health benefits. Even a 7 percent reduction in body weight substantially diminishes the risk of diseases like diabetes and cancer, Demark-Wahnefried says. This doesn\u2019t necessarily depend on the diet used, though. She points out that even the Atkins diet\u2014the antithesis of an \u201canti-inflammatory\u201d diet\u2014can lead to some clinical health benefits if it results in weight loss.\nAs for antioxidant supplements, studies suggest that there is no shortcut. Just adding an antioxidant supplement or two will not overcome all the inflammatory effects of the traditional Southern biscuits-and-gravy diet, for example. In fact, when it comes to research on isolated supplements, \u201cwe\u2019ve really bombed out at being able to predict what the benefit will be,\u201d says Demark-Wahnefried. \u201cThe more you separate the antioxidants from the whole food, the more danger you have of not having the right isoform or the appropriate mix. You lose a lot of the benefit of the whole food when you have that reductionist mentality.\u201d\nSo, to reduce chronic inflammation, Demark-Wahnefried recommends losing the extra pounds to reduce adipose stores, then following up with an overall healthier diet. She suggests consuming more fruits and vegetables and replacing unhealthy proteins with those rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as fish. Sounds a lot like an \u201canti-inflammatory\u201d diet, right? \u201cIt\u2019s all spin,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat they seem to be preaching is pretty much mainstream. They\u2019ve just repackaged it.\u201d\nA Primer on Produce\nFresh fruits and vegetables are best for nutritional value\u2014\u201cas long as they\u2019re fresh,\u201d Demark-Wahnefried notes. She explains that many fruits and vegetables sold in grocery stores are picked before their nutrients are at peak capacity, and more nutrients are lost during the long transit. In other words, buy local if possible.\nCanned fruits and vegetables can provide some nutrients, too, but the heat of the canning process can destroy some, which are known as heat-labile nutrients. \u201cA lot of B vitamins go up in smoke, and vitamin C and anything that is water-soluble is diminished,\u201d Demark-Wahnefried says. Heat-labile nutrients are also lost in dried fruits, but the soluble fiber (especially good for cholesterol levels) and many nutrients like magnesium and iron are maintained. One caveat: Dried fruit tastes good, so you\u2019re likely to eat more. \u201cIt\u2019s a substantial calorie load,\u201d she warns.\nAs for cooking, \u201cthere\u2019s a certain wisdom to eating things raw; you don\u2019t destroy the nutrients that are heat-labile,\u201d Demark-Wahnefried explains. \u201cBut by the same token, there are some substances in food that, when you cook them, actually have a better benefit for you.\u201d She recommends cooking vegetables in the microwave, which introduces the least amount of vitamin-leeching water and often requires a shorter cooking time. No matter how vegetables are prepared, she doesn\u2019t recommend overcooking them or adding lots of saturated fats.\nStill, we may not have to eliminate the biscuits and gravy completely. Demark-Wahnefried considers moderation essential. \u201cLet\u2019s face it. Everyone eats some foods that are unhealthy,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything\u2019s a balance.\u201d\n\u2014Written by Erin Thacker","id":"<urn:uuid:384106e7-f7d6-4ab1-a477-8f1645f71dc3>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.uab.edu\/news\/uab-magazine\/item\/2226-taming-the-fire-inside-the-truth-behind-anti-inflammatory-diets","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9318652749,"token_count":1137,"score":3.0625,"int_score":3}

The full release and related video are available on the NIMH site: Brain Matures a Few Years Late in ADHD, but Follows Normal Pattern.\nAutistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD):\nHow to Help Children with Autism Learn\nFrom Dr. Lauer and Dr. Beaulieu's talk\nQuick facts about Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD)\/ Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD)\n- Autism is a 'spectrum disorder' meaning that it affects children in different ways and at different times in their development.\n- Typically, delays and learning problems can emerge in several areas of functioning including social functioning, communication skills, motor skills, and overall intellectual potential.\n- Each child has their own learning style that includes specific learning challenges as well as areas of preserved skills and, at times, exceptional abilities.\n- Both autism and Asperger's disorder are on the same continuum but are distinct in their expression.\nWhat are the challenges students with PDD\/ASD frequently experience?\n- Academic difficulties that can often be misinterpreted as learning disabilities.\n- Problems with executive functioning skills.\n- Difficulty in forming relationships with peers.\n- Emotional difficulties due to learning and social problems such as anxiety, depression, low self-esteem.\n- Fear of new situations and trouble adjusting to changes.\n- May look like or be misconstrued as attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Nonverbal Learning Disability (NLD), Oppositional-Defiant Disorder or Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD).\nWhy choose US to help YOU?\n- Our evaluations are conducted by neuropsychologists who have been extensively trained in the early detection of autistic spectrum disorders and in the identification of specific patterns of learning strengths and weaknesses that are often associated with this condition.\n- Our evaluations help determine which teaching style is best suited to fit an individuals' specific learning profile; we also offer suggestions regarding compensatory educational approached.\n- We work as a team with other learning professionals, advocates and health professionals to enhance the child's potential for success in all settings.\n'The design of truly individual treatment plans that exploit strengths and compensate for weaknesses begins with a detailed understanding of how learning is different for children with autism than for those without autism and how learning is different among children with autism.'\n\u2014 Bryna Siegel, Ph.D., author of Helping Children with Autism Learn\nFor more information on current research, interventions and programs, follow us on Facebook.\nComing to see you for an evaluation was so helpful and Im so happy that I did this. After struggling for years with ADHD but not knowing thats what it was and almost completely ruining our marriage because of it, your diagnosis helped more than you could know. Now I know that its not just me the diagnosis has turned our lives around and helped me feel more accomplished at work. Thanks again for everything.\nSandy and Bob M.","id":"<urn:uuid:9b0b7a97-4882-4e06-adc0-44f4bbdc3349>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.cnld.org\/autistic_spectrum_disorders.php","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9517654777,"token_count":647,"score":3.390625,"int_score":3}
{"text":"In a countless number of movies and novels set in the British Regency and Victorian Era women are plagued by headaches; oftentimes as a way to show them as fragile, or as a joke. It is not a trope used with male characters, but if it were would they be taken seriously? Probably not. What if it was all viewed from a different angle and headaches were considered as something that legitimately affected their well-being? Maybe they were getting out of a carriage earlier in the week and bumped their head on the door frame causing a very mild head injury. What if in present day your head bumped against the driver\u2019s side window in a small accident with no other injury? Could that genuinely affect anyone\u2019s overall health?\nA new study by Dr. Sylvia Lucas, coming out of the American Headache Society\u2018s Annual Meeting, states that those who experience milder head injuries tend to have more post-traumatic headaches as time progresses than those with severe injuries.\nOut of the 598 participants in the study \u201cabout 70% [were] more likely than \u2026 their counterparts with moderate or severe injury to develop new headache or have a worsening of preexisting headache over the next year,\u201d Dr Lucas was quoted as saying. The majority of headaches were classified as migraines, though a large chunk was unclassifiable using the International Classification of Headache Disorders, second edition.\nThey do not know why this occurs, but Dr. Lucas thinks it is related to the specific mechanics of the accident that caused the head injury.\nBreaking down the participants: 220 had mild traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and began the study the same week of their accident; the other 378 had moderate to severe traumatic brain injury and were admitted to rehabilitation facilities. They found that migraines and tension headaches were most common, and that cervicogenic headaches were less common. This was unexpected considering most of the incidents that led to the TBI stemmed from motor vehicle accidents.\n\u201cStudy results showed that the mild TBI group and the moderate or severe TBI group had an identical prevalence of headache before injury (17%). But the former had a higher incidence of new or worsened headache at baseline (56% vs. 40%), at 3 months (63% vs. 37%), at 6 months (69% vs. 33%), and at 12 months (58% vs. 34%).\u201d\nIf you are wondering how this might severely affect somebody\u2019s life, about a year ago a story came out that soldiers were sidelined more from headaches than from other types of wounds. Headaches. For the study Dr. Steven P. Cohen and his colleagues \u201creviewed the records of 985 soldiers who had been evacuated from the wars during 2004-2009 with a primary diagnosis of headache.\u201d The causes of the headaches ranged from physical trauma, psychological or emotional, to environmental.\nOnly about a third of the patients in the study were able to return to duty.\nSo maybe headaches can cause a bigger imposition in life than originally thought. And the next time someone tells you \u201cit\u2019s just a headache\u201d this will give them something to think about.\nCheck back again next week when we see what else is new on MD Consult.blog comments powered by Disqus","id":"<urn:uuid:b7d63364-4020-4ab0-9c8c-3f97e616af1e>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/info.mdconsult.com\/blog\/2012\/08\/23\/but-its-just-a-headache\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9781063199,"token_count":670,"score":2.625,"int_score":3}
{"text":"As an OB\/GYN physician, I know intimately the dangers of preterm labor. I\u2019ve held in my arms the mother who lost her preemie daughter after her uterus inexplicably began contracting and spewed out her 24 week old baby before she was fully cooked. I\u2019ve watched the preemies in the nursery get stuck with tubes in every orifice while incubators try to mimic the womb and ventilators push air into their undeveloped lungs. I\u2019ve seen the children, years later, get wheeled into my exam room after enduring countless surgeries to deal with the disabilities prematurity can cause. And I\u2019ve attended the pregnant women we imprison in the hospital for weeks on end as we try to prevent this deadly pregnancy complication.\nWe don\u2019t know what causes preterm labor. If we did, we might be able to prevent it. It\u2019s still one of the great mysteries of obstetrics. While technological advances like gene therapy and transplant surgery revolutionize health care, we still don\u2019t understand the most basic things about how pregnancy works. In fact, at the University of Chicago, there\u2019s an empty plaque, awaiting the name of the person who discovers what causes labor, so we can learn to prevent preterm birth.\nSo far, we\u2019re still clueless.\nBut we\u2019ve made progress in the past decade. When a New England Journal of Medicine article suggested that the hormone 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-P) would reduce the risk of preterm birth, OB\/GYNs listened. However, this old drug, which used to be used to treat preterm birth, had fallen out of favor, and no manufacturers made it anymore.\nSo practitioners got resourceful and started getting 17-P from compounding pharmacies, where it could be manufactured from scratch for about $20 per dose.\nBecause the quality of compounding pharmacies vary, and because what drug a woman gets during pregnancy matters, docs were happy when the FDA approved a new drug Makena which would standardize 17-P and make it readily available at hospitals and pharmacies.\nThe FDA reviewed data of a study that showed that, among women with a prior preterm birth, women given Makena in a subsequent pregnancy had a preterm birth rate of 37%, compared to 55% in the control group. Good news, eh?\nYou\u2019d think. So KV Pharmaceutical, who won seven years worth of exclusive rights on this drug that has been around since the 1950s, then started firing off letters to compounding pharmacies, announcing that they could no longer make 17-P available to the public without facing possible legal action.\nWhich means that women at high risk of preterm birth must now buy Makena, instead of relying upon their friendly neighborhood compounding pharmacist to\nmake it up.\nSo how much does the new (old) drug Makena cost?\n$1500 per dose.\nYes, you heard me right. This $20 drug now costs $1500 per dose. That\u2019s about $30,000 per at-risk pregnancy. And insurances get to decide individually whether or not they will cover it -- but even if they do, that\u2019ll mean big co-pays and deductibles.\nCan I just say it like it is? BULLSHIT. F you, Big Pharma.\nAre you telling me that women who are at risk of preterm birth (lower socio-economic women are at the highest risk) will have to pony up 30 grand if they want\nto prevent losing a pregnancy or raising a disabled child because insurance won\u2019t cover it? Are you telling me our health care industry is so broken that, instead of making this ancient drug available at an affordable price and preventing preterm births, they\u2019d prefer to pay millions to care for that preemie in the NICU or treat that disabled child?\nWhy? Why? Why?\nWhy is this legal? According to the Washington Post, \u201cFDA officials said that they had no idea how much the company planned to charge for the drug and were surprised by the cost but that the agency has no power over pricing.\u201d\nHow did our health care industry become so broken that this kind of thing can happen? Where is the heart in medicine these days? When did patient care start taking a backseat to the bottom line?\nNo wonder patients and health care providers alike feel so frustrated, demoralized, and disempowered.\nSomething\u2019s gotta change.\nAccording to the same FDA official, \u201cIf requested, the agency could approve a lower-priced generic version of the drug for another use that doctors could prescribe 'off label.'\u201d The official also said that the agency would not prevent compounding pharmacies from continuing to provide 17-P unless patient safety is thought to be at risk. \u201cWe have our hands full pursuing our enforcement priorities,\u201d the official said to the Washington Post. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not illegal for a physician to write a prescription for a compounded drug or for a patient to take a compounded drug. We certainly are concerned about access of patients to medication.\u201d\nSo if you or anyone you know had a previous preterm baby, tell them to ask their doctor about prescribing 17-P. If the doctor thinks they are a good candidate for 17-P, suggest getting it from a compounding pharmacy, rather than supporting a Big Pharma company that\u2019s trying to screw us all.\nI still have my issues with Big Pharma, but I do understand that pharmaceutical industries pay big bucks to support research programs that help us all. I do understand that it\u2019s a business and that they need to make their money in the first seven years, while their drug is still under patent. I get that their business model supports innovation and the creation of drugs that move us forward, and that without them, we might lag in our pharmaceutical options.\nBut this drug has been around forever. And it\u2019s a natural hormone. I mean seriously people! Get a heart. These are pregnant women we\u2019re talking about. These are preemie babies we\u2019re trying to save. This is an old, natural hormone that you didn\u2019t just invent, KV. Do something right for a change. Put the health of people above the bottom line. Or at least back off the compounding pharmacies and let people seek this potentially life-saving hormone elsewhere. It\u2019s the right thing to do.\nWhat do you think of this? Is your blood boiling like mine is? How did this happen? When did we lose the heart of medicine?\nSpeaking up on behalf of mothers and babies everywhere,\nPS: Woah, check out this Washington Post article from this morning -- \"FDA to allow cheaper preterm baby drug\". Looks like the FDA is stepping in -- but still, how do you feel about this whole controversy? I'm glad the FDA is stepping up to the plate and laying off of compounding pharmacies, but still outraged that KV even tried something like this in our health care system.. On that note, I\u2019m hard at work on a manifesto about this very topic (not so much Big Pharma, but reclaiming the heart of healing).

One of the first drones was built by an English WWI pilot who hopped the pond to pursue his acting dream. In between small roles alongside Greta Garbo and Frank Sinatra, Reginald Denny turned his remote control airplane hobby into a military contract. His first RP-1, designed for military target practice, would become the US military\u2019s first mass-produced unmanned aerial vehicle. \u201cHe pitched basically a radio controlled airplane to fly as a target,\u201d says Tony Chong, the in-house historian at Northrop Grumman, which purchased Denny\u2019s company in 1952. \u201cA lot of people knew how to fly radio controlled planes back then.

During World War II, the company manufactured 15,000 drones for the US Army from its factory at the Van Nuys Airport in Los Angeles. The Navy also got in on the action, calling their drones the TDD-1: \u201cTarget Drone Denny 1\u201d. It wasn\u2019t until the late 1940s that Radioplane started developing the technology to pre-program plane routes. The next step was fully autonomous systems, which were around as early as the mid-70s.\nBut before drones would become a strange sign of our robot future, Denny\u2019s acting career would take off \u2013 he became a character actor, and appeared in Hitchcock\u2019s Rebecca. And he and his enterprise might also take credit for helping to launch the career of the most famous actress ever. Denny, believing there was real \u2018morale\u2019 potential on his factory floor, urged the captain of the Army\u2019s PR Hollywood division (Ronald Reagan, natch) to send over a photographer.

{"text":"Marlin, Blue \u2013 Hawaii\nBlue Marlin is a large pelagic species, found globally in both tropical and temperate waters. Blue Marlin mature early, produce many eggs , and grow fast, reaching sizes up to 450 cm and 900 kg.\nThey are caught commercially throughout the Pacific Ocean and are considered to comprise a single, ocean-wide population. The last population assessment for Blue Marlin in the Pacific indicated that abundance levels were moderate, but the assessment has not been updated for over a decade. There is some indication that Blue Marlin abundance around Hawaii may be declining.\nThis species is primarily captured with pelagic longlines, which result in minimal habitat damage and moderate bycatch rates. Around Hawaii, trolling is another common method used to catch Blue Marlin. Regulations for pelagic fisheries that capture Blue Marlin are set at both the international and national level, and include measures to effectively reduce fishery interactions with protected seabirds and sea turtles.\nThis fish may have high levels of mercury that could pose a health risk to adults and children.

{"text":"| Welcome to the lava tube\nportion of the Virtual Cave. Lava tube caves are found throughout the\nworld in places where fluid lava has flown over the surface. The longest\nand most vertically extensive lava tubes known are on the Big Island of\nHawai`i. Our idealized lava tube cross-section is based on\nthe tubes there, and most of the photos are from there. Lava tubes are\nfound in the western U.S.A. (Washington, California, Oregon, Nevada, Idaho,\nNew Mexico, Utah, and Arizona), the Canary Islands, Galapagos Islands,\nItaly, Japan, Korea, Kenya, Mexico, and many other volcanic regions. Most\ntubes form when fluid lava flows down the sides of volcanoes, the upper\nlayer begins to cool, and the lava beneath continues to flow in tubular\nconduits beneath the surface. Due to the insulating effects of the hardened\nlava above, molten lava is able to travel a considerable distance underground\nwith very little cooling. In Hawaii, lava tubes have carried fluid lavas\n50 or more miles from their source! Tubes may also form when lava\nfollows trenches or gulleys on the surface, which then roof over as lava\naccumulates along the top edges.\nLava tubes contain many features similar to those in limestone caves, such as stalactites and stalagmites, helictites, and a sort of flowstone. Most of the features in the diagram were made when the cave was active and during the early cooling stage. Secondary minerals may be deposited in the tubes later, such as gypsum or calcite crystals, but these tend to be on a much smaller scale than you can find in limestone caves.\nTo take a tour of the wondrous world of lava tubes, select a feature in context on our very cool Virtual Lava Tube Map (drawn by master lava tube cartographer Carlene Allred) or choose from the list above it.

{"text":"The rate of new HIV infections in the United States remained stable between 2006 and 2009 though infections increased among young black gay and bisexual men, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe first multiyear estimate of national HIV incidences found new infections have remained steady with an estimated 50,000 new infections each year. But the agency expressed concerns about the \u201calarming\u201d rate of new infections among young black gay and bisexual men, where there was a 48 percent increase in new infections between 2006 and 2009.\n\u201cBlacks account for almost half of all new infections in 2009. The overall infection rate is more than eight times higher than whites,\u201d CDC's Joseph Prejean told a telephone briefing.\nPrejean attributed the increase in new infections to a lack of access to health care and the stigma surrounding homosexuality and HIV. He also said insular communities make the spread of disease easier. In black communities where blacks are more likely to date other blacks, when an infected person is introduced to the community, disease spreads.\n\u201cHIV remains one of the most glaring health disparities in this country,\u201d said Dr. Kevin Fenton, director of the National Center for HIV\/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention at the CDC. \u201cWhile we all have individual responsibility to protect ourselves from HIV infection, the research clearly shows that individual risk behavior alone doesn\u2019t account for the significant racial disparities in HIV. It is essential to understand the underlying factors that contribute to these disparities, such as poverty, discrimination, and lack of access to health care.\u201d\nPeople of color have been hard hit by the HIV epidemic. Though blacks make up about 14 percent of the population, they accounted for about 44 percent of new HIV infections in 2009. Black women accounted for 57 percent of all new HIV infections among women in 2009. The infection rate among black women was 15 times that of white women. Latinos accounted for 20 percent of new infections in 2009, while making up 16 percent of the population. HIV rates remain highest among gay and bisexual Latino men.\nTo address the rate of infections, the CDC is pursuing a \u201cHigh-Impact Prevention\u201d program, where the agency will reevaluate current prevention activities for their effectiveness, cost, and coverage to get to areas that have a greater need for preventative efforts. Fenton said the program will work with primary care physicians and community health clinics to get more Americans tested\u2014less than half of the population reports having been tested.","id":"<urn:uuid:cbd2eb11-f6b0-4804-bbf1-b4c75a1be078>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.nationaljournal.com\/healthcare\/cdc-hiv-infection-rates-stable-increase-among-gay-black-males-20110803","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.942828238,"token_count":518,"score":2.78125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Last week, President Barack Obama ordered interim regulations designed to enable wildland firefighters employed by the federal government to purchase health insurance through their jobs.\nFor anyone who has seen this summer\u2019s catastrophic wildfires, this seems like a no-brainer. People who risk their lives to save others\u2019 lives and property, including public lands \u201cowned\u201d by the country\u2019s citizens, should be treated better.\nAccording to federal labor laws, most firefighters don\u2019t qualify as permanent employees. Even though they may put in nearly a full year\u2019s worth of hours during the fire season, the demand for men and women skilled in fighting wildfires drops precipitously during the winter. Keeping thousands of firefighters on the payroll all year long doesn\u2019t make fiscal sense.\nPolicies that push them toward other jobs make even less sense. Come spring, it makes sense to attract those who know what they are getting into and who already have been trained to fight fires effectively and safely.\nEvery employer, including Uncle Sam, knows benefits are not cheap. Employers also know that good benefits help attract and retain good employees. Seasonal workers often do not receive benefits because they are largely interchangeable. One quits, another is hired, only minimal training is required. Quality may suffer \u2013 newly hired servers make more errors, for example, and the thumbs of new landscape personnel are not quite as green \u2013 but inexperience goes with the territory and the budget.\nThat is hardly true of firefighters. These are not slow bloomers who ought to grow up and get a real job. They may never have another job as hard as this one. The hours are long, the working conditions are miserable and the work itself can be backbreaking, not to mention potentially fatal. They must respond quickly to rapidly worsening situations on unfamiliar terrain, and the consequences of not doing it well are catastrophic.\nAlthough some will transition into permanent public-lands jobs, most of these young men and women won\u2019t fight fires as a lifelong career. Similarly, not all enlisted military personnel serve until retirement; that does not mean their service is not valuable for its duration. While they serve, they deserve good benefits, and that certainly includes health insurance.\nInsurance is available to nearly everyone for the right price, but anyone who has ever tried to buy an individual policy knows it can be difficult to find and difficult to use \u2013 distractions that firefighters certainly do not need. Individual insurance also can be more expensive than seasonal firefighters can afford, but the lack of insurance hampers their ability to seek care.\nAnd they do need care, not only because they risk their lives and their health on our behalf, but because occupational hazards are not the only health-care problems they face.

{"text":"An economist who put a premium on truth: Obituary of Leonid Hurwicz\nFinancial Times comment, 19 July 2008\nLeonid Hurwicz, the economist who last year became the oldest person ever to win a Nobel prize, helped transform economic thinking in the second half of the 20th century.\nFor years economists had been passionately debating the rival merits of state planning versus free markets. In both systems, people had incentives to lie to bureaucratic planners or to employers about their interests, their skills or their circumstances. \u201cLeo\u201d, who has died at the age of 90, founded the field of \u201cmechanism design\u201d, a new way of thinking which focused on giving people incentives to tell the truth and to do so in a way that would benefit society as a whole.\nHis mechanism design idea has applications in a range of practical areas, from the design of computer networks and voting systems to arbitration rules.\nThe debate between state planning and free markets must have seemed far from academic to Hurwicz. His parents were Polish Jews who fled the Kaiser\u2019s invading army, going to Moscow, where Hurwicz was born in 1917. They returned to Poland in a horse-drawn wagon to escape the Bolsheviks when he was two. He went to the University of Warsaw and took a degree in law, though he also studied piano at the conservatory. Throughout his life Hurwicz was a renaissance man whose interests included music, linguistics, maths, physics and meteorology. Yet as a student his interest was kindled in economics. He went to London to study and then, via Geneva, to the US, where he arrived in 1940. His parents and his brother joined him but only after fleeing another invading German army \u2013 this time the Nazis \u2013 and then spending time in Soviet labour camps.\nOn his travels, Hurwicz had studied under both Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek, who was at the London School of Economics as Hurwicz began his PhD studies there in 1938. Von Mises and Hayek argued that a centrally planned economy was doomed to collapse: because every individual knew his own needs and capabilities best, government planners could never hope to piece it all together and make sensible decisions. Other economists, such as Oskar Lange, disagreed.\nA burgeoning economic theory of competitive markets, and bitter experience of the failings of socialist economies, led many to conclude that von Mises and Hayek were right.\nHurwicz was more interested in advancing the debate than declaring victory. \u201cPanaceas are not to be found at either end of the spectrum,\u201d he wrote in 1984. He agreed with Hayek and von Mises that a bureaucrat who simply demanded results would be met with slacking, budgetpadding and lies. But rather than giving up, Hurwicz attacked the problem directly. He asked what \u201cmechanisms\u201d an intelligent but ill-informed planner might use to extract information from others and then allocate resources fairly, efficiently or profitably.\nSuch mechanisms are as old as trade itself, most obviously the auction, in which even an ignorant seller can expect a good price. But Hurwicz laid the foundations for thinking systematically about designing mechanisms, defining all the terms rigorously and showing what might be possible.\nHurwicz described a mechanism as a kind of \u201cmessage centre\u201d, where market participants would submit information, true or false, and a pre-specified set of rules would adjudicate the result.\nThat abstract description is a perfect account of an Ebay auction: a seller sets a minimum bid, a time limit and perhaps a reserve price, while bidders submit bids that may bear no resemblance to the true value they place on the prize. EBay is just one example of a message centre; Hurwicz showed that it was useful to think about many economic institutions in this way.\nParticipants in a mechanism can always lie. A keen buyer can pretend to be an indifferent one; a brilliant worker can conceal his laziness. Hurwicz realised that in order to get a better bid from the keenest buyer, for example, the seller must give that buyer a reason to tell the truth.\nSimilarly, an employer cannot persuade the ablest worker to work just as hard as the rest unless the extra effort brings extra rewards. The general problem of persuading the \u201cbest\u201d agents to act differently from the rest is called the \u201cincentive compatibility constraint\u201d.\nOne example would be an auction where the highest bidder wins but only has to pay the second highest bid. This strange-sounding rule is all it takes to persuade the keenest bidder to tell the truth about the real value he places on the prize. EBay uses a similar rule.\nAlthough Hurwicz studied with the greats of the field \u2013 including Nicholas Kaldor at the LSE, and Paul Samuelson \u2013 he never had an economics degree. \u201cWhatever economics I learned, I learned by listening and learning,\u201d he said, after winning the Nobel prize.\nA warm and charming man, he had an impish wit. Once, a seminar speaker wrote an equation on the board, declared that the proof was \u201cobvious\u201d and stared around, daring anyone to challenge him. \u201cIs that proof by intimidation?\u201d Hurwicz quipped.\nHe joined the faculty of the University of Minnesota in 1951 and stayed there all his working life, even as his reputation outstripped the department\u2019s. \u201cSelf- promotion was completely alien to him,\u201d said John Roberts, a professor at Stanford. \u201cHe could have moved and he chose not to.\u201d\nHe travelled widely, spending time as a visiting professor at many universities, including stints in Bangalore, Tokyo and Beijing. A long-time member of the Minnesota Democrats, he supported the anti-Vietnam war candidacy of Eugene McCarthy and sat as a delegate at the party\u2019s national convention in 1968. He remained involved in the party up until his death.\nSome felt he should have won the Nobel prize sooner. He was not outwardly perturbed. \u201cI never had the impression that the wait bothered him,\u201d said Eric Maskin, who shared the prize with Hurwicz and Roger Myerson.\nHe is survived by his wife, Evelyn Jensen \u2013 they married in 1944 \u2013 and their two sons and two daughters.","id":"<urn:uuid:993fbde4-e496-4653-8cac-58dec4be4c66>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/timharford.com\/2008\/07\/an-economist-who-put-a-premium-on-truth-obituary-of-leonid-hurwicz\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9808811545,"token_count":1323,"score":2.796875,"int_score":3}
{"text":"To use kickstart mode, you must first create a kickstart file, and make it available to the Red Hat Linux installation program. Normally this is done by copying the kickstart file to the boot diskette, or making it available on the network. The network-based approach is most commonly used, as most kickstart installations tend to be performed on networked computers. This also makes it easier to install Red Hat Linux on many computers, as the kickstart files can be kept on single server system, and read by the individual computers during the installation.\nLet's take a more in-depth look at the locations where kickstart file may be placed.\nTo perform a diskette-based kickstart installation, the kickstart file must be named ks.cfg, and reside in the boot diskette's top-level directory. Note that the Red Hat Linux boot diskettes are in MS-DOS format, making it easy to copy the kickstart file under Linux using the mcopy command (or, if you insist, you can also use Windows). Although there's no technological requirement for it, most diskette-based kickstart installations install Red Hat Linux from CD-ROM.\nNetwork installations using kickstart are quite common, because system administrators can easily automate the installation of many networked computers quickly and painlessly. In general, the approach most commonly used is for the administrator to have both a BOOTP\/DHCP server and an NFS server on the local network. The BOOTP\/DHCP server is used to give the client system its networking information, while the NFS server serves the actual files used during the installation. Often these two servers run on the same physical machine, but there is no requirement for this.\nTo do a network-based kickstart installation, you must have a BOOTP\/DHCP server on your network, and it must include configuration information for the machine you are attempting to install. The BOOTP\/DHCP server will be used to give the client its networking information as well as the location of the kickstart file. If a kickstart file is specified by the BOOTP\/DHCP server, the client system will attempt an NFS mount of the file's path, and will copy the specified file to the client, using it as the kickstart file. The exact settings required vary depending on the BOOTP\/DHCP server you use. Here's an example for the DHCP server shipped with Red Hat Linux:\nfilename \"\/usr\/new-machine\/kickstart\/\"; next-server blarg.redhat.com;\nNote that you should use filename for the kickstart file's name (or the directory in which the kicstart file resides), and next-server to set the NFS server name.\nIf the filename returned by the BOOTP\/DHCP server ends with a slash (``\/''), then it is interpreted as a path only. In this case, the client system mounts that path using NFS, and searches for a specially-named file. The filename the client searches for is:\nThe <ip-addr> section of the filename should be replaced with the client's IP address in dotted decimal notation. For example, the filename for a computer with an IP address of 10.10.0.1 would be 10.10.0.1-kickstart.\nNote that if you don't specify a server name, then the client system will attempt to use the server that answered the BOOTP\/DHCP request as its NFS server. If you don't specify a path or filename, the client system will try to mount \/kickstart from the BOOTP\/DHCP server, and will try to find the kickstart file using the same <ip-addr>-kickstart filename as described above.","id":"<urn:uuid:7ed9e761-54db-4500-a92e-a1e5ccef8adf>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www-uxsup.csx.cam.ac.uk\/pub\/doc\/redhat\/redhat5.2\/5.2install-guide-dos\/manual\/doc139.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.8959351182,"token_count":783,"score":2.546875,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Sep. 3, 2008 University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill researchers have demonstrated that a drug called ondansetron helps reduce vomiting, the need for intravenous fluids and hospital admissions in children with acute gastroenteritis.\nGastroenteritis is an infection, often caused by a virus, that causes vomiting and diarrhea. It is often popularly called \u201cstomach flu\u201d and is a very common ailment in children during the winter months.\n\u201cChildren under the age of 5 years generally have between one and three episodes of gastroenteritis each year,\u201d said Dr. Lisa Ross DeCamp, lead author of the study, which is published in the September 2008 issue of Archives of Pediatric & Adolescent Medicine\n\u201cAnd about one of every 25 children in the country will be hospitalized for gastroenteritis by the time they\u2019re 5,\u201d said DeCamp who was a chief resident at the N.C. Children\u2019s Hospital at the time of the study but now works at the University of Michigan.\nIn the emergency department at UNC Hospitals, five to 10 children a day are seen with symptoms of gastroenteritis, said Dr. Michael J. Steiner, assistant professor of pediatrics and a co-author of the study.\nPersistent vomiting from acute gastroenteritis can be very frightening to children and their families and also poses a risk of dehydration. Current practice guidelines do not recommend that doctors give medications to children with gastroenteritis, but several recent studies suggest that ondansetron might be helpful.\nIn addition, Steiner said, many doctors are already prescribing ondansetron \u201coff-label\u201d for children with gastroenteritis. It has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for that indication, although it is approved for treating nausea caused by chemotherapy in cancer patients.\nTo find out if there was valid scientific support for giving antiemetics to children with gastroenteritis, DeCamp, Steiner and two UNC colleagues -- Dr. Julie S. Byerly, assistant professor of pediatrics, and medical student Nipa Doshi -- conducted a systematic review of all the medical literature studying the use of antiemetics for gastroenteritis.\nThe 11 identified previously published studies evaluated the safety and effectiveness of seven different antiemetics that were given to children seen in hospital emergency departments. The authors found that antiemetics other than ondansetron should not be used in children with gastroenteritis.\nA meta-analysis (a statistical way to combine different studies) found that ondansetron, which is sold under the brand name Zofran and is available as an intravenous infusion, tablet, disintegrating tablet or in liquid forms, reduced further vomiting after receipt in the emergency department. Importantly, it also reduced the likelihood that children would require intravenous fluids by nearly two-thirds, and halved the risk of immediate hospital admission. Ondansetron also had one down side: It was found to increase diarrhea in 3 of the 6 studies. However, the authors found this increased diarrhea did not appear to cause an increased need for further medical care.\nThe UNC researchers concluded that future treatment guidelines should recommend the use of ondansetron in select children with gastroenteritis.\nOther social bookmarking and sharing tools:\nNote: Materials may be edited for content and length.

{"text":"the energy [r]evolution\nThe climate change imperative demands nothing short of an Energy [R]evolution. The expert consensus is that this fundamental shift must begin immediately and be well underway within the next ten years in order to avert the worst impacts. What is needed is a complete transformation of the way we produce, consume and distribute energy, while at the same time maintaining economic growth. Nothing short of such a revolution will enable us to limit global warming to less than a rise in temperature of 2\u00b0 Celsius, above which the impacts become devastating.\nCurrent electricity generation relies mainly on burning fossil fuels, with their associated CO2 emissions, in very large power stations which waste much of their primary input energy. More energy is lost as the power is moved around the electricity grid network and converted from high transmission voltage down to a supply suitable for domestic or commercial consumers. The system is innately vulnerable to disruption: localised technical, weather-related or even deliberately caused faults can quickly cascade, resulting in widespread blackouts. Whichever technology is used to generate electricity within this old fashioned configuration, it will inevitably be subject to some, or all, of these problems. At the core of the Energy [R]evolution there therefore needs to be a change in the way that energy is both produced and distributed.\n4.1 key principles\nthe energy [r]evolution can be achieved by adhering to five key principles:\n1.respect natural limits \u2013 phase out fossil fuels by the end of this century We must learn to respect natural limits. There is only so much carbon that the atmosphere can absorb. Each year humans emit over 25 billion tonnes of carbon equivalent; we are literally filling up the sky. Geological resources of coal could provide several hundred years of fuel, but we cannot burn them and keep within safe limits. Oil and coal development must be ended. The global Energy [R]evolution scenario has a target to reduce energy related CO2 emissions to a maximum of 10 Gigatonnes (Gt) by 2050 and phase out fossil fuels by 2085.\n2.equity and fairness As long as there are natural limits there needs to be a fair distribution of benefits and costs within societies, between nations and between present and future generations. At one extreme, a third of the world\u2019s population has no access to electricity, whilst the most industrialised countries consume much more than their fair share.\nThe effects of climate change on the poorest communities are exacerbated by massive global energy inequality. If we are to address climate change, one of the core principles must be equity and fairness, so that the benefits of energy services \u2013 such as light, heat, power and transport \u2013 are available for all: north and south, rich and poor. Only in this way can we create true energy security, as well as the conditions for genuine human wellbeing.\nThe Advanced Energy [R]evolution scenario has a target to achieve energy equity as soon as technically possible. By 2050 the average per capita emission should be between 1 and 2 tonnes of CO2.\n3.implement clean, renewable solutions and decentralise energy systems. There is no energy shortage. All we need to do is use existing technologies to harness energy effectively and efficiently. Renewable energy and energy efficiency measures are ready, viable and increasingly competitive. Wind, solar and other renewable energy technologies have experienced double digit market growth for the past decade.\nJust as climate change is real, so is the renewable energy sector. Sustainable decentralised energy systems produce less carbon emissions, are cheaper and involve less dependence on imported fuel. They create more jobs and empower local communities. Decentralised systems are more secure and more efficient. This is what the Energy [R]evolution must aim to create.\nTo stop the earth\u2019s climate spinning out of control, most of the world\u2019s fossil fuel reserves \u2013 coal, oil and gas \u2013 must remain in the ground. Our goal is for humans to live within the natural limits of our small planet.\n4.decouple growth from fossil fuel use Starting in the developed countries, economic growth must be fully decoupled from fossil fuel usage. It is a fallacy to suggest that economic growth must be predicated on their increased combustion.\nWe need to use the energy we produce much more efficiently, and we need to make the transition to renewable energy and away from fossil fuels quickly in order to enable clean and sustainable growth.\n5.phase out dirty, unsustainable energyWe need to phase out coal and nuclear power. We cannot continue to build coal plants at a time when emissions pose a real and present danger to both ecosystems and people. And we cannot continue to fuel the myriad nuclear threats by pretending nuclear power can in any way help to combat climate change. There is no role for nuclear power in the Energy [R]evolution.","id":"<urn:uuid:b6cc700a-55c3-47a6-baaf-dbe7c04a4b04>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.energyblueprint.info\/1332.0.html?L=0","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9383349419,"token_count":982,"score":3.3125,"int_score":3}

It seems that computer safety has been a serious problem by now. Maybe you could learn something about the safety terms in Microsoft so that you could adopt the different methods according to different cases.\nWhat is malware? In fact malware, short for \u201cmalicious software\u201d, is any kind of software which is installed without your complete permission and is not in need at all.The famous malware areviruses, worms, and Trojan horses, which are almost known to us all. Even though you are not familiar with them, you must have heard of it at ordinary times. If you want to protect your computer from the malware, you could make sure that the automatic updating is turned on all the time to get the latest updates.\n2 antispyware software\nAntispyware software helps protect your computer, and prevent the pop-ups, slow performance, and security threats caused by spyware and other adverse software. Every computer user must keep antispyware software up to date in order to keep in touch with the latest spyware. Aimed at protecting our computer, we could use Microsoft Security Essentials, free download software, to be against spyware and other malicious software.\nA firewall is used to help screen out hackers, viruses, and worms that try to attack your computer through the Internet.In fact, if you are the one who use the computer at home, the most efficient and important step is to enable firewall when you start your computer.

This color change provides a way to visualize the time frame of promoter activity, indicating where in an organism the promoter is active and also when it becomes inactive. Easily detect the red and green emissions indicating promoter activity with fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry.\nEasily Characterize Promoter Activity\nThe Fluorescent Timer is a mutant form of the DsRed fluorescent reporter, containing two amino acid substitutions which increase its fluorescence intensity and endow it with a distinct spectral property: as the Fluorescent Timer matures, it changes color\u2014in a matter of hours, depending on the expression system used. Shortly after its synthesis, the Fluorescent Timer begins emitting green fluorescence but as time passes, the fluorophore undergoes additional changes that shift its fluorescence to longer wavelengths. When fully matured the protein is bright red. The protein\u2019s color shift can be used to follow the on and off phases of gene expression (e.g., during embryogenesis and cell differentiation).\nFluorescent Timer under the control of the heat shock promoter hsp16-41 in a transgenic C. elegans embryo. The embryo was heat-shocked in a 33\u00b0C water bath. Promoter activity was studied during the heat shock recovery period. Green fluorescence was observed in the embryo as early as two hr into the recovery period. By 50 hr after heat shock, promoter activity had ceased, as indicated by the lack of green color.\npTimer (left) is primarily intended to serve as a convenient source of the Fluorescent Timer cDNA.

Hormuz is the world's most important oil chokepoint due to its daily oil flow of almost 17 million barrels per day (bbl\/d) in 2011, up from between 15.5-16.0 million bbl\/d in 2009-2010. Flows through the Strait in 2011 were roughly 35% of all seaborne traded oil, or almost 20% of oil traded worldwide.\nOn average, 14 crude oil tankers per day passed through the Strait in 2011, with a corresponding amount of empty tankers entering to pick up new cargos. More than 85% of these crude oil exports went to Asian markets, with Japan, India, South Korea, and China representing the largest destinations.\nAt its narrowest point, the Strait is 21 miles wide, but the width of the shipping lane in either direction is only two miles, separated by a two-mile buffer zone. The Strait is deep and wide enough to handle the world's largest crude oil tankers, with about two-thirds of oil shipments carried by tankers in excess of 150,000 deadweight tons.\nSeveral alternatives are potentially available to move oil from the Persian Gulf region without transiting Hormuz, but they are limited in capacity, in many cases are not currently operating or operable, and generally engender higher transport costs and logistical challenges.\n- Alternate routes include the 745-mile Petroline, also known as the East-West Pipeline, across Saudi Arabia from Abqaiq to the Red Sea. The East-West Pipeline has a nameplate capacity of about 5 million bbl\/d, with current movements estimated at about 2 million bbl\/d.\n- The Abqaiq-Yanbu natural gas liquids pipeline, which runs parallel to the Petroline to the Red Sea, has a 290,000-bbl\/d capacity.\n- Additional oil could also be pumped north via the Iraq-Turkey pipeline to the port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean Sea, but volumes have been limited by the closure of the Strategic Pipeline linking north and south Iraq.\n- The United Arab Emirates is also completing the 1.5 million bbl\/d Abu Dhabi Crude Oil Pipeline that will cross the emirate of Abu Dhabi and end at the port of Fujairah just south of the Strait.\n- Other alternate routes could include the deactivated 1.65-million bbl\/d Iraqi Pipeline across Saudi Arabia (IPSA) and the deactivated 0.5 million-bbl\/d Tapline to Lebanon.\nEIA's World Oil Transit Chokepoints analysis brief contains additional information about other chokepoints, and the Middle East & North Africa overview contains additional information about countries in the region.","id":"<urn:uuid:59115ba6-5e81-4858-b414-89604ce9f241>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.eia.gov\/todayinenergy\/detail.cfm?id=4430","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9404731989,"token_count":615,"score":3.328125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"January 23, 2007:\nThe paper by researchers at Yale, the University of Winnipeg, Stony Brook University, and led by University of Florida paleontologist Jonathan Bloch reconstructs the base of the primate family tree by comparing skeletal and fossil specimens representing more than 85 modern and extinct species. The team also discovered two 56-million-year-old fossils, including the most primitive primate skeleton ever described.\nIn the two-part study, an extensive evaluation of skeletal structures provides evidence that plesiadapiforms, a group of archaic mammals once thought to be more closely related to flying lemurs, are the most primitive primates. The team analyzed 173 characteristics of modern primates, tree shrews, flying lemurs with plesiadapiform skeletons to determine their evolutionary relationships. High-resolution CT scanning made fine resolution of inaccessible structures inside the skulls possible.\n\"This is the first study to bring it all together,\" said co-author Eric Sargis, associate professor of anthropology at Yale University and Assistant Curator of Vertebrate Zoology at Yale's Peabody Museum of Natural History. \"The extensive dataset, the number and type of characteristics we were able to compare, and the availability of full skeletons, let us test far more than any previous study.\"\nAt least five major features characterize modern primates: relatively large brains, enhanced vision and eyes that face forward, a specialized ability to leap, nails instead of claws on at least the first toes, and specialized grasping hands and feet. Plesiadapiforms have some but not all of these traits. The article argues that these early primates may have acquired the traits over 10 million years in incremental changes to exploit their environment.\nWhile the study did not include a molecular evaluation of the samples, according to Sargis, these results are consistent with molecular studies on related living groups. Compatibility with the independent molecular data increases the researchers' confidence in their own results.\nBloch discovered the new plesiadapiform species, Ignacius clarkforkensis and Dryomomys szalayi, just outside Yellowstone National Park in the Bighorn Basin with co-author Doug Boyer, a graduate student in anatomical sciences at Stony Brook. Previously, based only on skulls and isolated bones, scientists proposed that Ignacius was not an archaic primate, but instead a gliding mammal related to flying lemurs. However, analysis of a more complete and well-preserved skeleton by Bloch and his team altered this idea.\n\"These fossil finds from Wyoming show that our earliest primate ancestors were the size of a mouse, ate fruit and lived in the trees,\" said study leader Jonathan Bloch, a vertebrate paleontology curator at the Florida Museum of Natural History. \"It is remarkable to think we are still discovering new fossil species in an area studied by paleontologists for over 100 years.\"\nResearchers previously hypothesized plesiadapiforms as the ancestors of modern primates, but the idea generated strong debate within the primatology community. This study places the origins of Plesiadapiforms in the Paleocene, about 65 (million) to 55 million years ago in the period between the extinction of the dinosaurs and the first appearance of a number of undisputed members of the modern orders of mammals.\n\"Plesiadapiforms have long been one of the most controversial groups in mammalian phylogeny,\" said Michael J. Novacek, curator of paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History. \"First, they are somewhere near primates and us. Second, historically they have offered tantalizing, but very often incomplete, fossil evidence. But the specimens in their study are beautifully and spectacularly preserved.\"\n\"The results of this study suggest that plesiadapiforms are the critical taxa to study in understanding the earliest phases of human evolution. As such, they should be of very broad interest to biologists, paleontologists, and anthropologists,\" said co-author Mary Silcox, professor of anthropology at the University of Winnipeg.\n\"This collaboration is the first to bring together evidence from all regions of the skeleton, and offers a well-supported perspective on the structure of the earliest part of the primate family tree,\" Bloch said.\nThe research was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation, Field Museum of Natural History, Yale University, Sigma Xi Scientific Research Society, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (Canada), University of Winnipeg, the Paleobiological Fund, and The Wenner--Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.","id":"<urn:uuid:3fb03c5f-56af-4237-afa9-75336a1587b5>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.strangeark.com\/blogarchive\/2007_01_01_archive.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9440796971,"token_count":932,"score":3.8125,"int_score":4}

Rosenfeld in the May 2004 Harper\u2019s.\nAmericans believe in the idea of democracy. We fight wars in its name and daily pledge allegiance to its principles. Curiously, the fervor with which we profess our faith in democracy is matched only by the contempt with which we regard our politics and politicians. How interesting that we should so dislike the process that we claim to revere. Perhaps, however, our unhappiness with politics points to something significant; perhaps Americans dislike the daily reality of their political system precisely because it falls short of being a proper democracy. Indeed, in the last presidential election, we saw a man take office who did not win the popular vote. Money above all else shapes our political debate and determines its outcome, and in the realm of public policy, even when an overwhelming democratic majority expresses its preference (as for national health insurance), deadlocks, vetoes, filibusters, and \u201cspecial interests\u201d stand in the way. No wonder so few people vote in national elections; we have become a nation of spectators, not citizens.\nThe United States of America is not, strictly speaking, a democracy; indeed, the U.S. Constitution was deliberately designed to prevent the unfettered expression of the people\u2019s will. Yet the Founders were not, as some imagine, of one mind concerning the proper shape of the new American union, and their disputes are instructive. The political dysfunction that some imagine to be a product of recent cultural decadence has been with us from the beginning. In fact, the document that was meant to prevent democracy in America has bequeathed the American people a politics of minority rule in which our leaders must necessarily pursue their unpopular aims by means of increasingly desperate stratagems of deceit and persuasion.\nYet hope remains, for if Americans have little real experience of democracy, they remain a nation convinced that the best form of government is by and for the people. Growing numbers of Americans suspect that all is not right with the American Way. Citizens, faced with the prospect of sacrificing the well-being of their children and grandchildren on the altar of supply-side economics, the prospect of giving up new schools and hospitals so that the colony in Iraq might have zip codes and modern garbage trucks, have begun to ask hard questions. Politics, properly understood as the deliberate exercise of citizenship by a free people, appears to be enjoying a renaissance, but the hard point must be made nonetheless that tinkering with campaign-finance reform is unlikely to be sufficient to the task. True reform becomes possible only if Americans are willing to return to the root of our political experiment and try again. And if democracy is our aim, the first object of our constitutional revision must be the United States Senate.\n\u201cWe now have probably the most powerful upper house of any legislature,\u201d Ritchie said. \u201cCombine that with the inequality, and it creates some peculiar situations.\u201d Not all small states are G.O.P. strongholds. (Hello, Vermont, Delaware and Rhode Island.) And it\u2019s true that Obama won the 2008 nomination thanks in part to racking up caucus victories in states such as Idaho and Wyoming. But since Obama took office, senators from the wide-open spaces have asserted themselves against him over and over. Conrad opposed his plan to cut subsidies for wealthy farmers. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) pushed to focus transportation funding in the stimulus bill on rural areas and last week blocked the lifting of sugar tariffs to protect the ethanol industry. \u2013\u201cThe Gangs of D.C.: In the Senate, small states wield outsize power.

Large retailers like Home Depot, Kmart, Lowe\u2019s and Wal-Mart bought starter plants from industrial breeding operations in the South and distributed them throughout the Northeast. (Fungal spores, which can travel up to 40 miles, may also have been dispersed in transit.) Once those infected starter plants arrived at the stores, they were purchased and planted, transferring their pathogens like tiny Trojan horses into backyard and community gardens. Perhaps this is why the Northeast was hit so viciously: instead of being spread through large farms, the blight sneaked through lots of little gardens, enabling it to escape the attention of the people who track plant diseases. It\u2019s important to note, too, that this year there have been many more hosts than in the past as more and more Americans have taken to gardening\u2026 the explosion of home gardeners\u2014 the very people most conscious of buying local food and opting out of the conventional food chain\u2014 has paradoxically set the stage for the worst local tomato harvest in memory. \u2013\u201cYou Say Tomato, I Say Agricultural Disaster,\u201d Dan Barber, The New York Times\nSuggestions for flavours range from Gooey Decimal System to Sh-sh-sh-sherbet.

Li-Berry pie could mix lime sherbet with raspberry sauce and pie-crust pieces, and Overdue Fine as Fudge Chunk could drop fudge brownies and white chocolate coins into milk chocolate ice-cream swirled with caramel.

{"text":"Register New Player\nWelcome to our world of fun trivia quizzes and quiz games:\nWeather Occurrences of \"Biblical\" Proportions\n\"This quiz will deal with the usually normal subject of weather. But weather can take on miraculous traits when dealing with God and the Bible. Here are ten events listed in the Bible that involve weather. (King James Version used)\"\n15 Points Per Correct Answer - No time limit\nAccording to the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus Christ was involved in some weather a few times in his lifetime. One occurred when he was approaching the disciples. The disciples were attempting to fish in a storm when they saw Jesus walking on the water toward them. When he reached and boarded the boat, the storm subsided. What body of water did this miracle occur on?\nSea of Galilee\nProbably the best known event involving weather in the Bible is the Great Flood. Through studying the Bible, theologians have determined the length of time that Noah, his family, and the animals were on the ark. What is the time frame in days that scholars tend to agree on as the length of Noah's captivity on the ark?\nWeather happenings were prevalent during the ten plagues of Egypt. One of the plagues featured a horrendous hailstorm, accompanied by fire. Of the ten plagues, which number plague was this?\nGod and Moses also used the weather to actually END one of the plagues, as it is stated they used a \"mighty wind\" to drive out this particular plague's results. What was it that the mighty wind was getting rid of?\nBlood on the Water\nIn Exodus 19, Moses had another occurrence with Biblical weather when he went up the mountain to receive God's Ten Commandments. What mountain was surrounded by \"thunder and lightning\" and a \"veil of clouds\" during Moses' climb upward?\nMount of Olives\nThis person experienced some dangerous sea storms upon his attempted fleeing from God's request to go to Nineveh and try and convert the people there. Who was this reluctant evangelist who had a whale of a time surviving the sea storm?\nTwo people are documented in the Bible as never dying. One was Enoch, who was taken up to Heaven in Genesis 5. The other was this prophet, who according to II Kings 2, \"went up by a whirlwind into Heaven\". Who was this servant of God who was whisked to Heaven on a chariot of fire by way of a whirlwind?\nAccording to Joshua 10, while Joshua was holding camp in the large city of Gibeon, five kings of surrounding areas banded together to wage war upon Joshua's people. This would prove disheartening to them, as God was with Joshua's men and they were forced to flee after losing the battle. But the weather played a part afterwards. Before they had made the complete retreat back home, the armies were nearly wiped out by what weather phenomenon brought on by God?\nAccording to the book of the same name, this man of God had a vision that featured some unique weather. From the opening verses of the first chapter: \"And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.\" The vision gets even more intense after that. Who was this godly man?\nIn the King James Version, along with several other translations, \"Peace, be still\" are famous words used to stop a storm while riding on a boat. What transpired previous to those words frightened all the passengers on the boat, as the strong wind was threatening to capsize the boat. Who was it that ended this weather malady with three simple words?\nJohn the Baptist\nCopyright, FunTrivia.com.

{"text":"Friday, 11 December 2009\nmental ray_Adding glow to the window glass\nThe above image was produced whilst at GMJ Design Ltd\nIn our latest book, we have covered a number of ways of emulating light without the need of creating a physical light.\nProduction companies often adopt similar methods to reduce the rendering times and retain the overall quality.\nIt is worth pointing out that the usage of Ambient Occlusion(i.e. AO) as a separate pass or\/and directly from Max is utterly imperative for the final shot.\nThe following exercise will take you through another unique methodology of achieving similar results with reduced rendering times:\nAnother quick way of emulating \u201cglow\u201d\/\"light\" on windows, is to in fact enable the glow function on the glass panes themselves.\nTo do this, simply go to the main material parameters, under the \"refraction\" group.\n1-Reduce the transparency to about 0.9 to prevent the surface from being fully transparent.\n2-To add a bit of blur to the transparency, decrease the glossiness to about 0.78. Note that, these values may vary depending on one\u2019s camera angle...and the level of transparency\/blurriness intended.\n3-Next,change the colour swatch from white to a warm yellow.\nAlso, the \"fast (interpolate)\" function, can be enabled for quick and fast results, as the glossiness and its samples can often slow down the renders.However,it may create artifacts.\n4-Pan down to the \"self illumination (glow)\" parameters and enable the \"self illumination (glow)\" function.\n5-Under the \"luminance\" group, change it from \"unitless\" to \"physical units: cd\/m2)\". Also, pick and choose any relevant bitmap (i.e. photo) that has a prominent light source.\nNote: The \"unitless\" function often creates artifacts on glossy reflections, therefore, to be avoided at all costs.\nDepending on time in hand, one can set the glow to generate light, or not, through the FG, by checking the \"illuminates the scene (when using fg)\" function.\n...and... \u201c...let there be light...\u201d!!!\nThe final rendered image below was achieved using this technique.

{"text":"Snow leopard population discovered in Afghanistan\nThe Wildlife Conservation Society has discovered a surprisingly healthy population of rare snow leopards living in the mountainous reaches of northeastern Afghanistan's Wakhan Corridor, according to a new study. The discovery gives hope to the world's most elusive big cat, which calls home to some of the world's tallest mountains. Between 4,500 and 7,500 snow leopards remain in the wild scattered across a dozen countries in Central Asia.\nThe study, which appears in the June 29th issue of the Journal of Environmental Studies, is by WCS conservationists Anthony Simms, Zalmai Moheb, Salahudin, Hussain Ali, Inayat Ali and Timothy Wood.\nWCS-trained community rangers used camera traps to document the presence of snow leopards at 16 different locations across a wide landscape. The images represent the first camera trap records of snow leopards in Afghanistan. WCS has been conserving wildlife and improving local livelihoods in the region since 2006 with support from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).\n\"This is a wonderful discovery \u2013 it shows that there is real hope for snow leopards in Afghanistan,\" said Peter Zahler, WCS Deputy Director for Asia Programs. \"Now our goal is to ensure that these magnificent animals have a secure future as a key part of Afghanistan's natural heritage.\"\nAccording to the study, snow leopards remain threatened in the region. Poaching for their pelts, persecution by shepherds, and the capture of live animals for the illegal pet trade have all been documented in the Wakhan Corridor. In response, WCS has developed a set of conservation initiatives to protect snow leopards. These include partnering with local communities, training of rangers, and education and outreach efforts.\nAnthony Simms, lead author and the project's Technical Advisor, said, \"By developing a community-led management approach, we believe snow leopards will be conserved in Afghanistan over the long term.\"\nWCS-led initiatives are already paying off. Conservation education is now occurring in every school in the Wakhan region. Fifty-nine rangers have been trained to date. They monitor not only snow leopards but other species including Marco Polo sheep and ibex while also enforcing laws against poaching. WCS has also initiated the construction of predator-proof livestock corrals and a livestock insurance program that compensates shepherds, though initial WCS research shows that surprisingly few livestock fall to predators in the region.\nIn Afghanistan, USAID has provided support to WCS to work in more than 55 communities across the country and is training local people to monitor and sustainably manage their wildlife and other resources. One of the many outputs of this project was the creation of Afghanistan's first national park \u2013 Band-e-Amir \u2013 which is now co-managed by the government and a committee consisting of all 14 communities living around the park.\nSnow leopards have declined by as much as 20 percent over the past 16 years and are considered endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\nWCS is a world leader in the care and conservation of snow leopards. WCS's Bronx Zoo became the first zoo in the Western Hemisphere to exhibit these rare spotted cats in 1903. In the past three decades, nearly 80 cubs have been born in the Bronx and have been sent to live at 30 zoos in the U.S. and eight countries in Europe, Asia, Australia, and North America.\nSource: Wildlife Conservation Society\n- Wildlife Conservation Society finds 'world's least known bird' breeding in AfghanistanWed, 13 Jan 2010, 14:10:53 EST\n- WCS confirms the return of the Persian leopard In Afghanistan's central highlandsMon, 5 Dec 2011, 22:39:32 EST\n- First ever videos of snow leopard mother and cubs in dens recorded in MongoliaThu, 12 Jul 2012, 18:05:03 EDT\n- Wildlife Conservation Society documents pneumonia outbreak in endangered markhor Sun, 8 Jan 2012, 21:31:30 EST\n- Rare Andean cat no longer exclusive to the AndesWed, 16 Mar 2011, 14:36:29 EDT\n- Threatened snow leopards found in Afghanistanfrom AP ScienceFri, 15 Jul 2011, 0:00:36 EDT\n- Elusive snow leopards thrive in Afghan regionfrom MSNBC: ScienceThu, 14 Jul 2011, 16:00:21 EDT\n- Photos: Elusive Snow Leopards Thrive in Surprising Spotfrom Live ScienceThu, 14 Jul 2011, 11:30:44 EDT\n- Cameras catch snow leopards in Afghanistanfrom UPIThu, 14 Jul 2011, 5:30:29 EDT\n- Cameras catch snow leopards in Afghanistanfrom UPIWed, 13 Jul 2011, 18:00:26 EDT\n- Snow leopard population discovered in Afghanistanfrom Science BlogWed, 13 Jul 2011, 14:00:23 EDT\n- Snow leopard population discovered in Afghanistanfrom Science DailyWed, 13 Jul 2011, 13:30:31 EDT\n- Snow leopard population discovered in Afghanistanfrom PhysorgWed, 13 Jul 2011, 12:32:13 EDT\n- Healthy Snow Leopard Population Discovered in Afghanistanfrom Newswise - ScinewsWed, 13 Jul 2011, 12:32:02 EDT\nLatest Science NewsletterGet the latest and most popular science news articles of the week in your Inbox!

{"text":"Many people think that a robot:\n- Is not 'natural' \/ was made by man.\n- Can see, hear or feel.\n- Can do a job \/ useful work.\n- Is intelligent, or can make choices.\n- Can be programmed to do different things.\n- Can move.\n- Seems to have a life of its own, like an animate object.\n- Is roughly the same shape as a human.\nPeople have been interested in building machines to do work for us for a long time. But it takes time and money to build just one machine, so early ideas stayed ideas, or were built to make rich people laugh. Leonardo Da Vinci designed a man-shaped machine to look like a knight in 1464. It would be controlled with ropes and wheels. Other engineers and dreamers drew mechanical men. So in 1920, Karel \u010capek wrote a novel about them, and he used a word from Czech that is connected with 'work': robot. But the most successful robot designs in the 1900's were not made to look like people. They were designed for their use. George Devol made the first of these, the Unimate, in 1954, and General Motors bought it in 1960. The next year, it started work in a factory in New Jersey. The engineers could program it, and reprogram it if they had to.\nModern Robots [change]\nRobots now have many uses. Many factories use robots to do lots of hard work quickly and without many mistakes. These are 'industrial' robots. The military uses robots to find and get rid of bombs. If someone makes a mistake, the robot is damaged or destroyed, which is better than a person being killed. There are also robots that help at home, to vacuum or cut grass, for example. Such robots must learn about the area of work. There are two robots on Mars. Because it takes a long time to send a signal from Earth to Mars, the robots do much of their work alone, without commands from Earth. People still think of robots as having a shape like a person\u2014two legs, two arms, and a head. ASIMO is one robot that is helping scientists learn how to design and program robots. It can walk, which is not easy to program.\nEastern and Western Views [change]\nEastern Thoughts on Robots [change]\nRoughly half of all the robots in the world are in Asia, 32% in Europe, and 16% in North America, 1% in Australasia and 1% in Africa. 30% of all the robots in the world are in Japan. Japan has the most robots of any country in the world, and is the leader in the world robotics industry. Japan is actually said to be the robotic capital of the world.\nIn Japan and South Korea, ideas of future robots have been mainly positive. The positive reception of robots there may be partly because of the famous cartoon robot, 'Astroboy'. China expressed views on robotics that are similar to those of Japan and South Korea, but China is behind both America and Europe in robotic development. The East Asian view is that robots should be roughly equal to humans. They feel robots could care for old people, teach children, or serve as assistants. The popular opinion of East Asia is that it would be good for robots to become more popular and more advanced. This view is opposite to the popular Western view.\n\"This is the opening of an era in which human beings and robots can co-exist,\" says Japanese firm Mitsubishi about one of the many human-like robots in Japan. The South Korean Ministry of Information and Communication has predicted that every South Korean household will have a robot by between 2015 and 2020.\nIn this sense, people in Japan are much more likely to be affected by Technosexuality, as they are much more exposed to robots in their society. South Korea aims to put a robot in every house there by 2015-2020 in order to help catch up technologically with Japan. This will obviously have an impact on the technosexuality of South Korea. China, like South Korea, wishes to catch up with Japan, and has been developing robots very quickly. After China becomes more developed, and each person has more money to view the media, where robots could be seen, or to buy robots, as is happening in Japan and South Korea, technosexuality will probably rise there too, when considering the current opinions of the people of robots.\nWith a limited number of robots in the rest of the world away from Japan, and even in Japan too, movies and literature are the where most of the technosexuality will be towards. Futuristic images\/descriptions or robots may encourage technosexuality. At the moment, there are not that many real human-like robots in the world. The most human-like robot in the world, 'Actroid', made by Japanese company 'Kokoro' a division of 'Sanrio', is a good example of the target for technosexuality.\nWestern Thoughts on Robots [change]\nWestern societies are more likely to be against, or even fear the development of robotics, through much media output in movies and literature that they will replace humans.\nThe West regards robots as a 'threat' to the future of humans, which is also muchly due to religious influence of the Abrahamic religions, in which creating machines that can think for themselves would almost be playing God. Obviously, these boundaries are not clear, but there is a significant difference between the two ideologies.\nRobot Laws [change]\nThe writer Isaac Asimov told many stories about robots who had three robot laws to keep them safe, as well as to keep humans safe from them.\n- A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\n- A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.\n- A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.\nThese were not used in real life when he invented them. However, in today's world robots are more complicated, and one day real laws may be needed, much like Isaac Asimov's original three laws.\nThese laws are talked about in the Megaman video games.\nOther pages [change]\nOther websites [change]\n|Wikimedia Commons has media related to: Robots|\n- Research societies\n- IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (RAS) and its wiki.\n- International Foundation of Robotics Research (IFRR)\n- Robotics at the Open Directory Project\n- http:\/\/robots.net \u2013 Daily news about robots, robotics, and AI\n- A brief history of robotics\n- A giant list of known robots\n- NASA and robots\n- NASA Robotics Division\n- International Federation of Robotics\n- Should we be worried by the rise of robots?\n- Podcast 'Talking Robots' - interviews with high-profile professionals in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence\n- French collection of toy robot\n- Introduction to Robotics\n- Robot World News\n- Robot news, robot tutorials, robot videos and robot chatbox\n- Robot news, theory of robotics\n- List of robots\n- Brandweek: Even Robot Suicide Is No Laughing Matter\n- Robots Today and Tomorrow: IFR Presents the 2007 World Robotics Statistics Survey; World Robotics; 2007-10-29; retrieved on 2007-12-14\n- Reporting by Watanabe, Hiroaki; Writing and additional reporting by Negishi, Mayumi; Editing by Norton, Jerry;Japan's robots slug it out to be world champ; Reuters; 2007-12-02; retrieved on 2007-01-01\n- Lewis, Leo; The robots are running riot!

{"text":"Benefits of XQuery\nThe principal benefits of XQuery are:\n- Expressiveness - XQuery can query many different data structures and its recursive nature makes it ideal for querying tree and graph structures\n- Brevity - XQuery statements are shorter than similar SQL or XSLT programs\n- Flexibility - XQuery can query both hierarchical and tabular data\n- Consistency - XQuery has a consistent syntax and can be used with other XML standards such as XML Schema datatypes\nXQuery is frequently compared with two other languages, SQL and XSLT, but has a number of advantages over these.\nAdvantages over SQL\nUnlike SQL, XQuery returns not just tables but arbitrary tree structures. This allows XQuery to directly create XHTML structures that can be used in web pages. XQuery is for XML-based object databases, and object databases are much more flexible and powerful than databases which store in purely tabular format.\nUnlike XSLT, XQuery can be learned by anyone familiar with SQL. Many of the constructs are very similar such as:\n- Ordering Results: Both XQuery and SQL add an\norder byclause to the query.\n- Selecting Distinct Values: Both XQuery and SQL have easy ways to select distinct values from a result set\n- Restricting Rows: Both XQuery and SQL have a WHERE X=Y clause that can be added to an XQuery\nAnother big advantage is that XQuery is essentially the native query language of the World Wide Web. One can query actual web pages with XQuery, but not SQL. Even if one uses SQL-based databases to store HTML\/XHTML pages or fragments of such pages, one will miss many of the advantages of XQuery's simple tag\/attribute search (which is akin to searching for column names within column names).\nAdvantages over XSLT\nUnlike XSLT, XQuery can be quickly learned by anyone familiar with SQL. XSLT has many patterns that are unfamiliar to many procedural software developers. Also, whereas XSLT is good for using as a static means to convert one type of document to another, for example RSS to HTML, XQuery is a much more dynamic querying tool, useful for pulling out sections of data from large documents and\/or large number of documents.\nThe Debate about XQuery vs. XSLT for Document Transformation\nThere has been a debate of sorts about the merits of the two languages for transforming XML: XSLT and XQuery. A common misconception is that \"XQuery is best for querying or selecting XML, and XSLT is best for transforming it.\" In reality, both methods are capable of transforming XML. Despite XSLT's longer history and larger install base, the \"XQuery typeswitch\" method of transforming XML provides numerous advantages.\nMost people who need to transform XML hear that they need to learn a language called XSLT. XSLT, whose first version was published by the W3C in 1999, was a huge innovation for its time and, indeed, remains dominant. It was one of the very first languages dedicated to transforming XML documents, and it was the first domain-specific language (DSL) to use advanced theories from the world of functional programming to create very reliable, side-effect free transformations. Many XML developers still feel strong indebted to this groundbreaking language, since it helped them see a new model of software development: one focused around the transformation of models and empowering them to fuse both the requirements and documentation of a transformation routing into a single, modular program.\nOn the other hand, learning XSLT requires overcoming a very substantial learning curve. XSLT's difficulty is due, in part, to one of the key design decisions by its architects: to express the transformation rules using XML itself, rather than creating a brand new syntax and grammar for storing the transformation rules. XSLT's unique approach to transformation rules also contributes to the steepness of the learning curve. The learning curve can be overcome, but it is fair to say that this learning curve has created a opening for an alternative approach.\nXQuery has filled this demand for an alternative among a growing community of users: they find XQuery has a lower learning curve, it meets their needs for transforming XML, and, together with XQuery's other advantages, it has become a compelling \"all-in-one\" language. Like XSLT, XQuery was created by the W3C to handle XML. But instead of expressing the language in XML syntax, the architects of XQuery chose a new syntax that would be more familiar to users of server-side scripting languages such as PHP, Perl, or Python. XQuery was designed to be similar to users of relational database query languages such as SQL, while still remaining true to functional programming practices. Despite its relative youth (XQuery 1.0 was only released in 2007 when XSLT had already reached its version 2.0), XQuery was born remarkably mature. XML servers like eXist-db and MarkLogic were already using XQuery as their language for querying XML and performing web server operations (obviating the need for learning PHP, Perl, or Python).\nSo, in the face of the XSLT community's contention that \"XSLT is best for transforming documents and XQuery is best for querying databases\", this community of users was surprised to find that XQuery has entirely replaced their need for XSLT. They have come to argue unabashedly that they prefer XQuery for this purpose.\nHow does XQuery accomplish the task of transforming XML? The primary technique in XQuery for transforming XML is a little-known expression added by the authors of XQuery, called \"typeswitch.\" Although it is quite simple, typeswitch enables XQuery to perform nearly the full set of transformations that XSLT does. A typeswitch expression quickly looks at a node's type, and depending on the node's type, performs the operation you specify for that type of node. What this means is that each distinct element of a document can have its own rule, and these rules can be stored in modular XQuery functions. This humble addition to the XQuery language allows developers to transform documents with complex content and unpredictable order - something commonly believed to be best reserved for the domain of XSLT. Despite the differences in syntax and approach to transformation, a growing community has actually come to see the XQuery typeswitch expression as a valid, even superior, way to store their document transformation logic.\nBy structuring a set of XQuery functions around the typeswitch expression, you can achieve the same result as XSLT-style transforms while retaining the benefits of XQuery: ease of learning and integration with native XML databases. Even more important for those users of native XML databases, the availability of typeswitch means that they only need to learn a single language for their database queries, web server operations, and document transformations. These XQuery typeswitch routines have proved easy to build, test, and maintain - some believe easier than XSLT. XQuery typeswitch has given these users a high degree of agility, allowing them to master XQuery fully rather than splitting their time and attention between XQuery and XSLT.\nThat said, there is still a large body of legacy XSLT transforms that work well, and there are XSLT developers who see little benefit from transitioning to a typeswitch-style XQuery. Both are valid approaches to document transformation. A natural tension has arisen between the proponents of XQuery typeswitch and XSLT, each promoting what they are most comfortable with and believe to be superior. In practice you might be best served by trying both techniques and determining what style is right for you and your organization. Without presuming a background or interest in XSLT, this article and its companion article help you to understand the key patterns for using XQuery typeswitch for your XML transformation needs.","id":"<urn:uuid:4e5da1e0-fbf3-4bf9-bfb9-40a6d6a93da8>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/en.m.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/XQuery\/Benefits","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9248849154,"token_count":1630,"score":2.75,"int_score":3}

Then the printer must check the height of the object to make sure everything is calibrated correctly. Mr. Carvalho placed a paper card on the platform of the 3D-Bioplotter to demonstrate how the machine works.\nMr. Carvalho then talked us through the printing process. To begin, a liquefied material \u2013 in this case a silicone paste \u2013 is pressed through a needle-like tip by applying air pressure. The needle moves in all three dimensions which means it is able to create a three dimensional object. The printer is called \u2018Bioplotter\u2019 because the unique aspect of this machine is its use of biomaterials to make implants or other objects for biomedical application.\nSome of the implants which are made using the 3D Bioplotter are intended to dissolve in the body. The materials which are used in this application include PLLA, PLGA, and silicone.\nImplants made with thermoplastics \u2013 as they are mostly water and CO2 \u2013 are removed by the body naturally in around a week or two. Other materials, such as ceramic paste, may also be used to print implants. The implants printed using ceramic paste do not dissolve. Instead, the body uses this material to create new bone. This actually speeds up the process of the body\u2019s regeneration.\nThe 3DBioplotter also prints hydrogels \u2013 such as collagen or alginate. These materials can have human cells actually added to them. Thus human cells may be printed directly with this machine.\nEvery Thursday is #3dthursday here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has thrilled us at Adafruit with its passion and dedication to making solid objects from digital models.

{"text":"Ragtime and blues fused \u2018All That Jazz\u2019\nBy Laura Szepesi\nPublished: Sunday, March 17, 2013, 7:09 p.m.\nUpdated: Monday, March 18, 2013\nEDITOR'S NOTE: Thursday marks the 85th birthday of well-known Connellsville jazz trombonist Harold Betters. We salute him with this four-part series, starting today with a brief history of jazz music.\nIn 1979, actor Roy Scheider brought the life of Broadway dancer \/ director Bob Fosse to the big screen in the film \u201cAll That Jazz.\u201d\n\u201cAll\u201d is the perfect way to describe jazz music.\nJazz was born around 1900 in New Orleans \u2014 about the same time as the earliest music recordings became available to the public. It grew out of ragtime, which many sources claim is the first true American music.\nLike jazz, ragtime has Southern roots, but was also flavored by the southern Midwest. It was popular from the late 1800s to around 1920. It developed in African American communities, a mix of march music (from composers such as John Philip Sousa), black songs and dances including the cakewalk.\nRagtime: Dance on\nEventually, ragtime spread across the United States via printed sheet music, but its roots were as live dance music in the red light districts of large cities such as St. Louis and New Orleans. Ernest Hogan is considered ragtime's father. He named it ragtime because of the music's lively ragged syncopation.\nRagtime faded as jazz's following grew. However, composers enjoyed major success in ragtime's early years. Scott Joplin's 1899 \u201cMaple Leaf Rag\u201d was a hit, as was his \u201cThe Entertainer,\u201d which was resurrected as a Top 5 hit when it was featured in the 1974 movie \u201cThe Sting\u201d starring Robert Redford and Paul Newman.\nBorn of ragtime, jazz was also heavily influenced by the blues. Blues originated in the late 1800s, but in the deep South. It is an amalgam of Negro spirituals, work songs, shouts, chants and narrative lyrics.\nFused with blues\nLike jazz, the blues comes in many forms: delta, piedmont, jump and Chicago blues. Its popularity grew after World War II when electric guitars \u2014 rather than acoustic guitars \u2014 became popular. By the early 1970s, blues had formed another hybrid: blues rock.\nWhile ragtime is jangly and spirited, the blues takes after its name: blue, or melancholy. Its name is traced to 1912 when Hart Ward copyrighted the first blues song, \u201cDallas Blues.\u201d\nJazz \u2014 as a mix of ragtime and blues \u2014 has fused into many styles since its emergence.\nIn the 1910s, New Orleans jazz was the first to take off. In the 1930s and 1940s, Big Band swing, Kansas City jazz and bebop prevailed. Other forms include cool jazz and jazz rock; today, there's even cyber jazz.\nJazz: Always changing\nThe late jazz trombone player J.J. Johnson summed jazz up as restless. \u201cIt won't stay put ... and never will,\u201d he was quoted as saying, according to various sources.\nJohnson's sentiment is heartily endorsed by Connellsville jazz trombonist Harold Betters. Betters turns 85 years old this week. He will share decades of his memories about music and growing up in Connellsville as his March 21 birthday approaches.\nLaura Szepesi is a freelance writer.\nTuesday: Just how did Harold Betters decide to play the trombone?\n- Uniontown police investigate shooting injury\n- Upper Tyrone family helps pet overcome paralysis\n- Several Fayette boroughs have contested races\n- Recap of the death of Connellsville police officer McCray Robb in 1882\n- Connellsville police officer recognized 131 years after death\n- Fayette County man accused of receiving stolen property, multiple drug offenses\n- Connellsville set to debut model-railroad train in 2014\n- Connellsville airport will remain open\n- Connellsville mayoral candidate Joshua DeWitt held for trial in chop shop case\n- South Connellsville man charged in pedestrian accident\n- Connellsville council to make appointments, reappointments\nYou must be signed in to add comments\nTo comment, click the Sign in or sign up at the very top of this page.\nSubscribe today!

{"text":"California, the largest and most important of the Pacific Coast States, is the second State of the United States in point of area, and the twenty-first in point of population. It is bounded on the north by the State of Oregon; on the east by the State of Nevada and, for a comparatively short distance, by the Territory of Arizona; on the south by the Peninsula of Lower California (Mexico); and on the west by the Pacific Ocean. It lies entirely between 42\u00b0 and 32\u00b0 N. lat., and between 12\u00b05 and 11\u00b03 W. long. It is 800 miles long, running in a north-westerly and south-easterly direction, and has an average width of 200 miles. According to the official returns of the United States Census of 1900, its total area is 158,360 square miles. Of this number 2,188 square miles constitute the water area; the total land area, therefore, is 156,172 square miles. The capital of the State is Sacramento, with a population (1900) of 29,000. San Francisco, built on San Francisco Bay, is the metropolis, with a population (1900) of 342,000. The other chief cities, with a population according to the United States Census of 1900, are Los Angeles, 102,000; Oakland, 66,000; San Jos\u00e9, 21,000; San Diego, 17,000; Stockton, 17,000; Alameda, 17,000; Berkeley and Fresno, 12,000. These figures have been enormously increased since 1900. The estimated population of the three largest cities in January, 1907, was as follows: San Francisco, 400,000; Oakland, 276,000; and Los Angeles, 245,000.\nThe State presents two systems of mountains which converge at Mount Shasta, in the north, and Tehachapi, in the south. The outer, or western, range is called the Coast Range, and is close to the sea, in some places coming down precipitately to the water's edge; the eastern range is called the Sierra Nevada. The latter is considerably higher than the former, and in several peaks reaches a height of more than 14,000 feet. The Sierra Nevadas extend along the eastern border of the State for about 450 miles; they are but a portion, physically, of the Cascade Range, which traverses also the States of Oregon and Washington. The Sierra Nevada Range is practically unbroken throughout the entire length of the State of California, the Coast Range is broken by the magnificent harbour of San Francisco. Both of these ranges follow the general contour of the coast line. Between them lies a great valley which is drained by the Sacramento River in the north and the San Joaquin River in the south. These two rivers, navigable by steamers for about 100 miles from their mouth in San Francisco Bay, constitute a great parent water-system of California, and both empty into the harbour of San Francisco, which is situated approximately midway between the northern and southern extremities of the State. The Sierra Nevada Mountains form the great watershed from which are fed most of the rivers and streams of California. The combined valleys of the Sacramento and the San Joaquin rivers are approximately 500 miles long, and have an average width of 50 miles. This area, the surface of which is quite level, is one of the most fertile regions in the world.\nIn addition to those already mentioned, the divisions of the mountain ranges form numerous smaller valleys. The principal of these are Sonoma, Napa, Ukiah, Vaca, Contra Costa, and Alameda valleys in the north; and Santa Clara, Pajaro, and Salinas valleys in the south. South of the Tehachapi Range, in Southern California, is another low-lying stretch of country which has become the centre of the citrus industry and the home of a large variety of semi-tropical fruits. In the south-eastern part of the State and east of the mountains is the low-lying desert region consisting of the Mojave Desert and Death Valley. Owing to the great height of the Sierra Nevada Mountains and their comparative proximity to the sea, the numerous streams, fed from their glaciers and perpetual snows, afford abundant water-power throughout their steep descent to the sea. This power is utilized for generating light and operating mills and factories.\nCalifornia has one of the finest harbours in the world, San Francisco Bay, capable of accommodating the combined navies of the world. There are five other bays forming good harbours, San Diego, San Pedro, Humboldt, Santa Barbara, and Monterey bays. The 800 miles of California's length from north to south are equal to the combined length of ten States on the Atlantic seaboard; the northern line of California is on the same latitude as Boston, and the southern line is that of Savannah, Georgia. The entire state is subject to the beneficent influence of the Japan Current. The climate is equable; except in the high mountains, snow and the extremes of cold, experienced in the same latitudes on the Atlantic Coast, are unknown. There are, in reality, but two seasons: the wet and the dry. The wet or rainy season lasts from about September to April, during which the rains are occasional, alternating with clear weather. During the entire summer the winds from the west and south-west blow over the coast, keeping the weather cool, and not infrequently bringing in cold fogs towards evening. But it is chiefly in the balminess of its winters that the climate of California excels. It is never too cold to work outdoors, and the citrus fruits, semi-tropical as they are, grow to perfection throughout the valleys of California. The records of the climate left by early Franciscan missionaries who evangelized California are duplicated by those of the Government Weather Bureau of today.\nThe population of California, according to the United States Census of 1900, is 1,485,053, or 9.5 per square mile. This figure constitutes an increase of 22.7 percent upon the population of 1890. The following table, taken from the United States Census of 1900, exhibits the population of California in each census year since its admission into the Federal Union, its rank among the States in point of population, and the percentage of increase in its population during the period of ten years between each census:\n|Year||Rank||Population||Percentage of Increase|\nThe census of 1900 also presents the following details of population: (a) White, 1,402,727; African, 11,045; Indian, 15,377; Chinese, 45,753; Japanese, 10,151. (b) Native-born, 1,117,813; Foreign-born, 367,240; (c) Males, 820,531; Females, 664,522. The estimated population of California (January, 1907) is 2,217,897, an increase of 732,844, or 49.3 percent since the census of 1900.\nThe soil of the State of California is rich and highly productive. It consists for the most part of alluvial deposits. This is especially true of the delta lands of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. Much of the so-called desert land consists of a rich subsoil covered with but a thin crust of sand. The value of irrigation in making this desert land productive, as well as in enriching the soil by bearing to it the washed-out life-principles from the uplands, is almost incalculable. The soil readily responds to the plough, and there is no hard, tough subsoil to be turned and mellowed. California has approximately 40,000,000 acres of arable land. To this must be added fully 10,000,000 acres of its so-called desert land, which needs but the touch of water from its irrigation systems to make it as productive as the valley or farm lands. The remaining 50,000,000 acres of California's domain, the mountainous and desert acreage, afford pasturage for millions of cattle and sheep. The chief products of the soil of California are hay, grain, fruits, wines, lumber, dairy produce, and livestock. It may be safely said that, in the combined values of these products, California is the richest in the United States. Ships loaded with her grain at San Francisco Bay carry their precious cargoes to every port in the world; her fruits, packed in special cars and shipped by fast freight, are the first choice in Chicago and New York, and find a ready market in London; her wines have given a standard of excellence to American wines, and \"American wines\" means \"California wines\" the world over.\nThe total value of all California's agricultural products, according to the census of 1900, was $131,690,606. The value of the output in 1906 reached the total of $213,000,000. The following table presents the total output of agricultural products in detail for the year 1906:\nAsparagus 23,000,000 pounds\nAlmonds 4,200,000 pounds\nApricots 585,000 pounds\nApples 132,455,000 pounds\nBeans 125,000,000 pounds\nBarley 24,000,000 bushels\nBrandy 4,070,992 gallons\nCitrus Fruits 18,220,000 boxes\nCanned Fruits and Veg. 4,475,751 cases\nCorn 2,000,000 bushels\nCherries 5,382,000 pounds\nFigs 45,000 pounds\nGrapes 73,224,000 pounds\nHops 73,000 bales\nHay 3,000,000 tonnes\nLumber 900,000,000 feet\nPears 54,390,000 pounds\nPeaches 21,015,000 pounds\nPlums 43,938,000 pounds\nPrunes 180,000,000 pounds\nRaisins 100,000,000 pounds\nOther Dried Fruit 41,000,000 pounds\nOlive Oil 51,000 gallons\nPotatoes 6,500,000 bushels\nWalnuts 12,800,000 pounds\nWool 22,000,000 pounds\nWheat 4,700,000 centals\nWine 41,000,000 gallons\nThe total annual output of fruit from California farms is $40,000,000, and this is made up of all known fruits that grow in temperate and semi-tropical climates. In the year 1906 there were 30,000,000 fruit trees in California; this figure does not include nuts, figs, olives, or berries. Six million of these fruit trees belong to Santa Clara Valley alone. The principal fruit trees are as follows: apple trees, 4,000,000; apricot trees, 3,500,000; cherry trees, 1,000,000; peach trees, 4,500,000; pear trees, 2,000,000; orange trees, 6,000,000; lemon trees, 2,000,000. There are 272,500 acres of land devoted to the cultivation of grapes: 250,000 for wine, and 22,500 for table grapes.\nThe total value of the output in manufactures in 1900, according to the census, was $302,874,761. In 1906 it amounted to $400,000,000. The chief elements contributing to California's success in manufactures are an abundance of raw material from her soil, cheap fuel from her forests, and cheap power from her streams. The heaviest items of manufacture are sugar, lumber and timber products, flour, machinery, and leather goods. During 1906 the total output of sugar was 62,110 tons. The discovery of rich deposits of petroleum has given an impetus to manufactures that is already far-reaching in its results. In 1900 there were 12,582 manufacturing plants in California, representing a total investment of $205,395,025, and giving employment to 98,931 persons; the sum paid out for labour was $55,786,776, and for materials, $188,125,602.\nMining is still one of the most important industries of California, notwithstanding that the flood of population first lured to her mountains by the discovery of gold has long ago been turned to agriculture and commerce. There are some forty-seven mineral substances now being mined in the State. The value of the total output in 1900 was $28,870,405. In 1906 it was over $54,000,000. Gold, petroleum, and copper are now the most valuable items of this output. In the same year there were 1,107 producing mines in the State. The value of the gold output was $19,700,000; silver, $2,460,000; copper, $3,750,000; quicksilver, $904,000; petroleum, $10,000,000. It is estimated that in the petroleum industry alone the total investment is more than $20,000,000; 35,000,000 barrels of oil were produced in 1906. There are also large and valuable deposits of brick and pottery clays, lime, asphaltum, bitumen, and iron ore.\nTwenty-two per cent of the area of the State is forest-clad, and the importance of the lumber industry in California increases each year as the mountains of the east and the north are denuded of their trees. California is the home of the redwood (Sequoia). These remarkable trees attain a height of three hundred feet in the famous groves of Big Trees in Mariposa and Calveras Counties. Redwood and pine are the two principle woods. It is estimated that, without the growth of another tree, the forests of California can not be exhausted for two hundred years. San Francisco alone sends 400,000,000 feet of lumber to the world each year. The total output of the State for 1906 was 900,000,000 feet. There are $16,000,000 invested in the industry, 250 mills, and the value of the total output, together with the by-products of the forests, is $17,000,000--the lumber itself amounting to $8,500,000.\nThroughout the splendid harbour of San Francisco passes by far the greatest part of the ocean commerce of California, as well as of the entire Pacific Coast. The harbours of the State now carry on an ocean commerce of about $100,000,000 per year, the precise figure for 1906 being: imports $49,193,303; exports $45,479,422. The total foreign commerce of the State for 1900 was $119,212,911, and in 1906 San Francisco was fourth among the cities of the United States in point of customs receipts. Besides the ocean commerce of California with every port of the world which passes through her harbours, she has direct communication by rail with every quarter of the United States. Four great transcontinental railroads carry her goods and passengers to and from her cities, and a fifth is now (1907) nearing completion. In 1900 the total railroad mileage of the State was 5,532.\nThe educational system of the State commences with primary schools and continues through grammar schools and high schools, culminating in the State University. These are all public schools, being supported by the State and counties, and affording free education to all. The State Constitution creates the office of Superintendent of Public Instruction; it also provides for a superintendent of schools for each of the fifty-seven counties of the State. It makes provision for the maintenance of the public school system, and directs that the proceeds of all public lands and of all escheated estates shall be appropriated to the support of the common schools. The State University is situated at Berkeley on the Bay of San Francisco. It was created by act of the legislature on 23, March, 1868, and this act is confirmed by the present constitution (that of 1879), making the organization and government of the university perpetual. The university is designed for the education of male and female students alike, and in fact the principle of co-education is recognized and put in practice in nearly all state educational institutions.\nThe total number of professors, including the various officers of instruction and research, in the University of California, for the year ending 30 June, 1906, was 318, as follows: academic, 252; art, 9; Lick Astronomical Observatory, 9; law, 6; medicine, 34; pharmacy, 8. The total number of students for the same period was 3,338, of whom 2,007 were men, and 1,331 women, the women being nearly 40 percent of the total enrollment. This percentage is far higher in the Colleges of Letters, Social Sciences, and Natural Sciences, in which, as an average, the women outnumber the men more than two to one. The College of Agriculture, as well as several other technological colleges, including the College of Mechanics, the College of Mining, the College of Commerce, the College of Civil Engineering, and the College of Chemistry, are designed to afford a complete technical training in their respective branches. The Affiliated Colleges of the University, being the schools of Law, Medicine, Pharmacy, and Dentistry, are situated in San Francisco; there are several experiment stations for which the university receives $15,000 annually from the Federal Government; and there is a State University Farm of 780 acres at Davisville. The university has been the recipient of munificent endowments both from the State and from private persons. In addition to these, and the proceeds of public land already mentioned, a direct tax of two cents on every $100 of taxable property in the State is levied, and applied to the support of the university. But four of the fifty-seven counties of the State have no high school, and some counties have several. There are also five normal schools, situated respectively at San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Jos\u00e9, San Diego, and Chico. In addition to these there are night schools, technical schools, and commercial schools in all the large cities of the State.\nThe public school system of the State was founded in the constitutional convention at Monterey, in September, 1849. The 500,000 acres of land granted by Congress to new States for the purpose of internal improvement were appropriated to constitute a perpetual school fund. It was also provided that a school should be kept in each district at least three months each year to secure any share of the State school funds. In the school year ending 30 June, 1906, there were 3,227 primary and grammar schools in the State, and 117 high schools. The total number of teachers in the public schools was 9,371; the total number of pupils, 321,870. The total number of pupils in private schools was 43,080. California has been more than lavish in her provision for her public school system. The total income of her public schools during the scholastic year 1905-06 was $11,494,670.29. The total value of public school property for the same year was $23,860,341. This does not include the State University. The total income of the State University for the same period was $1,564,190. The Leland Stanford Junior University is situated at Palo Alto. It was founded by Mr. and Mrs. Leland Stanford as a memorial to their only child. The total value of the endowments given to the university by its founders reaches the astonishing figure of $26,000,000. Like the University of California, it is co-educational, but the number of women students is limited to 500. The university was opened to students in 1891.\nThe work of religious education in California is confined almost exclusively to institutions under Catholic auspices. In California the Catholic Church, notwithstanding that she receives no financial aid from the State, and that the support of her schools and colleges must be derived entirely from contributions of the faithful, has done great things in the cause of Christian education. The great pioneers of Catholic education in California were the Jesuits. In 1851 Santa Clara College was founded by the venerable Father John Nobili, S.J. This was followed, four years later, by the establishment of St. Ignatius College in San Francisco under the leadership of the Rev. Anthony Maraschi, S.J. From the days of these small beginnings the zeal of those charged with the education of Catholic youth has been untiring, progress has been steady, and the results already achieved have more than compensated for the sacrifices and expenditures which the work entailed. The following figures for the year 1907 will give some idea of the importance of Catholic education in California: 1 archdiocesan seminary, 5 seminaries of religious orders, 1 normal school, 11 colleges, academies and high schools for boys, 47 academies for girls, 73 parochial schools, 31,814 young people under Catholic care . Besides the institutions just mentioned there are numerous orphan asylums, industrial school, infant asylums, day homes and a protectory for boys to which is attached a boys' industrial farm at Rutherford. In addition to the colleges in charge of the Jesuits already mentioned, the Christian Brothers conduct Sacred Heart College in San Francisco, and St. Mary's College in Oakland. St. Vincent's College, in Los Angeles, is under the care of the Vincentian Fathers. There are several other universities and colleges, as well as numerous grammar, primary and secondary schools and kindergartens, under private management.\nThe origin of the name California has been the subject of some conjecture; but certain it is that by the end of the sixteenth century it was applied to all the territory claimed by the Spanish Crown, bordering on the Pacific Ocean and lying north of Cape San Lucas. In a much later day it came to designate, under the familiar phrase, \"The Two Californias\", the territory now included in the State of California, and the Peninsula of Lower California. After Florida, California is the oldest name of any of the United States. The land was discovered by the Spaniards--Lower California by Cortez who visited the peninsula in 1533; and Alta or Upper California by Cabrillo, in 1542. Lower California had been evangelized by the Jesuits who established eighteen missions between 1697 and 1767. Upon the expulsion of the Jesuits in the latter year, the care of the missions and the conversion of the Indians in the Spanish settlements were entrusted to the Franciscans. To them therefore belongs the honour of founding the great mission system of California proper. The leader of this gigantic work was the renowned Father Jun\u00edpero Serra, and his first settlement in California was the mission of San Diego, which he established in July, 1769. San Francisco was founded in 1776. For fifteen years the saintly man laboured in California with apostolic zeal, and at the time of his death in 1784, he established nine missions between San Diego and San Francisco. The total number of missions founded in California by the Franciscans was twenty-one, and they extended from Sonoma in the north to San Diego in the south. Prominent among them were Santa Clara, San Luis, Obispo, Santa Barbara, and San Juan Capistrano. The missions were all established under the sovereignty of the King of Spain; each mission had its church, a residence for the fathers, a presidio, or military guard, and shops and workrooms for the Indians, who, besides receiving instruction in the Faith, were taught the useful arts of civilization. (See CALIFORNIA MISSIONS.) Each mission was established in conjunction with a Spanish settlement under a civil governor, and during this period, the immigration was almost exclusively Spanish and Mexican. In 1822 California ceased to be a Spanish colony and became part of the territory of Mexico. From that date begins the decline of the missions; the policy of the government became one of annoyance, interference, and aggression. Finally, in 1834, began the secularization of the missions, which was in fact their downright confiscation. The Fathers were deprived of their lands and buildings; and the Indians freed from the benevolent government of the friars.\nThe results were disastrous. The Indians were scattered and dispersed, and many of them lapsed into barbarism. The missions themselves were destroyed. This confiscation forms one of the saddest injustices in history. The temporal wrongs done at this time were partially righted in 1902 by the award of the International Tribunal of Arbitration at The Hague, in the case of the Pious Fund, which adjudged the payment by Mexico to the United States for the Catholic Church in California, of the accrued interest of the Fund. When taken over by President Santa Anna in 1842, the total value of the Pious Fund estates was estimated at $1,700,000. In 1826 the first emigrant train of Americans entered the present territory of California. From that year onward there was a gradual influx of Americans, most of whom engaged in trading, hunting, prospecting, cattle-raising, and farming. As the American population increased there were frequent misunderstandings and clashes with the Mexican authorities, some of them not altogether creditable to the Americans. Commodore Jones made an unauthorized seizure of Monterey in 1842. The United States Government subsequently disavowed his acts and made apologies to Mexico.\nIn 1846 a party of Americans seized Sonoma, captured the commandant, and proclaimed the independence of the Republic of California. The young republic chose the Bear Flag as its emblem. In a few weeks news was received of hostilities between the United States and Mexico; the Bear Flag gave place to the American Flag; and Monterey, San Francisco, Sonoma, and Sutter's Fort were soon in the hands of the Americans. California was finally ceded to the United States, on the conclusion of the war with Mexico, by the Treaty of Guadeloupe Hidalgo, proclaimed 4 July, 1848. In January, 1848, gold was discovered by James W. Coloma, on the American River. The news spread like wildfire, and by the early part of 1849 a mighty tide of immigration had set in. The gold-seekers came from every section of the United States, and from Europe. In that year more than 80,000 men arrived in California. These men were afterwards called the \"Forty-niners\". Some of them came from Australia; some, from New York and Europe by way of Cape Horn; some crossed the Isthmus of Panama; while a large number came across the plains in caravans, on horseback, and even on foot. Fortune awaited thousands of these pioneers in the rich placer mines, and California became the richest gold-producing State in the United States. But thousands of those who were unsuccessful in their quest for gold, found even greater and more lasting wealth in tilling the rich soil and engaging in commerce. After the excitement caused by the discovery of gold had subsided, a steady stream of immigration began, and continues to the present time. The foreign immigrants have been chiefly Irish, German, English, Canadian, Italian, and French, though there are also considerable numbers of Portuguese and Swedes. As shown in the tables already presented, more than seventy five percent of the total population in 1900 was native-born.\nSo rapid was the growth of population after the discovery of gold, that in 1849 a constitution was adopted by the convention at Monterey, and California was admitted into the Union of States by Act of Congress on 9 September, 1850. That day has ever since been a legal holiday, and is generally celebrated and referred to as Admission Day. Peter H. Burnett was elected first governor of the new state and served during 1851 and 1852. All sorts of men found their way into the new El Dorado, as it was called. Most of them were hardy, industrious, and honest--these were the true pioneers. But there was a considerable admixture of the reckless and daredevil element, criminals and desperadoes, who sought fortune and adventure in the new gold diggings. In 1851 there was a veritable carnival of crime in San Francisco which the lawfully constituted authorities were unable to suppress. The citizens of the city organized themselves into a Vigilance Committee and punished crimes and criminals in summary fashion. The members of the committee were known as \"Vigilantes\", and were for the most part honest and reputable men, who resorted to these measures only from motives of necessity and duty, in the disturbed condition of the government. A similar condition arose again in 1856 and was met by the same remedy. It must be said that the trials of the Vigilance Committee, while informal, were in the main fair, and the punishments inflicted richly deserved.\nLarge numbers of Chinese coolies had emigrated to California ever since 1850; the influx was greatest during the building of the Central Pacific Railroad which was completed in 1869. A strong anti-Chinese sentiment developed, due chiefly to three principal objections made against them: they worked for wages much lower than white men; they spent little of their earnings; they rarely established homes, but lived together in large numbers and in unclean surroundings. The agitation grew to tremendous proportions, provoked serious riots, and finally resulted in the so-called Chinese exclusion acts which have been enacted periodically by Congress since 1882. There were at one time over 100,000 Chinese in California. In 1900 the number had decreased to 45,753; and it is now (1907) much smaller. In 1891 the Australian Ballot was introduced at State elections. Among other important political events of the last twenty-five years was the prohibition of hydraulic mining, which had destroyed immense areas for agriculture and had choked up river beds with the accumulation of detritus; also the passage of numerous beneficial laws for the promotion of irrigation, for the fumigation of fruit trees, and for the importation of predatory insects for the purpose of destroying insect pests. The present constitution of California was adopted in 1879. During the Spanish-American War and the subsequent American occupation of the Philippines, San Francisco has been the chief depot for the transportation of troops and supplies. On 18 April, 1906, one of the greatest earthquakes recorded in history visited the coast of California; it was most severe in San Francisco. Fire started simultaneously in a dozen quarters and burned incessantly for three days. All but the western and southern parts of the city were consumed. The city, as a city, was destroyed. The loss of life is estimated at 500, and of property at $500,000,000. More than 300,000 people left the city after the fire. Over 200,000 of these have returned, and incredible strides have been made in rehabilitating the city. Nearly $200,000,000 have been expended (December, 1907) on improvements in the 497 city blocks that were destroyed.\nThe territory of the State of California is divided, ecclesiastically, into the Archdiocese of San Francisco, the Diocese of Monterey and Los Angeles, and the Diocese of Sacramento. The first includes the city of San Francisco and the central and more westerly counties of the State. The second includes all of Southern California. The third embraces the entire northern part of the State, as well as nearly half of the State of Nevada. With the exception of the Diocese of Sacramento, their boundaries are conterminous with those of the State. The Diocese of Salt Lake, in Utah, and the Dioceses of Sacramento and of Monterey and Los Angeles are suffragan to the Archdiocese of San Francisco. The Catholic population of California is estimated at 344,000 (1906), made up as follows: Archdiocese of San Francisco, 227,000; Diocese of Sacramento, 42,000; Diocese of Monterey and Los Angeles, 75,000. By far the greater portion of these are white, the total of blacks, Indians, and Chinese being less than five percent.\nFrom 1769, the year which saw the foundation of San Diego, until the second expedition of Fremont (1846), the settlers and immigrants were chiefly Catholic, being natives of Spain and Mexico. The discovery of gold in 1848 was immediately followed by an inrush of thousands of immigrants. These gold-seekers were mostly Americans, but there was also a large proportion of foreigners. From that time until the present, the immigration has been steadily on the increase, the Catholic part of it being chiefly Irish, Irish-American, Italian, French, and German.\nThe first governor of California, Peter H. Burnett, was a convert to the Catholic Faith. Stephen M. White, who represented California in the Senate of the United States, was one of the first graduates of the Jesuit college at Santa Clara. He was an astute lawyer, a brilliant orator, and a tireless worker. E. W. McKinstry, like Judge Burnett, was a convert to the Faith; and like him, also, was a member of the Supreme Bench. Judge McKinstry was a man of deep erudition, a fine constitutional lawyer, and an exemplary Catholic. W. G. Lorigan, a Catholic, was also chosen to the Supreme Bench. Joseph McKenna, another California Catholic, became a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (1898), and James F. Smith, General in the United States Army, Member of the Philippine Commission, and Governor-General of the Philippine Islands, is another alumnus of Santa Clara College. Garret W. McEnerney, one of the leaders of the California Bar, who won international fame by his masterful presentation of the claims of the Catholic Church in California to the Pious Fund (q.v.) before the Tribunal Arbitration at The Hague in 1902, graduated at St. Mary's College.\nThe following statistics of the Catholic Church in California are taken from the Catholic Directory for 1907: archbishop, 1; bishops, 2; total priests, 488; secular, 321; religious, 167; total churches, 366; churches with resident priests, 209; missions with churches, 157; stations, 119; seminary, 1; seminaries of religious orders, 5; colleges and academies for boys, 11; academies for young ladies, 47; parishes with parochial schools, 73; orphan asylums, 12; total young people under Catholic care, 31,814; Catholic population, 344,000. There are houses or monasteries of Jesuits, Dominicans, Franciscans, Paulists, Marists, Selesians, Christian Brothers, and Brothers of Mary. The Catholic sisterhoods are almost all represented.\nThe total number of churches was 1505; total value of church property, $11,961,914; total number of communicants, 280,619. Of course, these figures have been greatly increased since that time. Catholics do not recognize any such enumeration as \"communicants\"; the total for this head therefore underestimates the Catholic population.\n|Denomination||Organization||Churches||Value of church property||Number of communicants|\nThe constitutional provision safeguarding religious freedom is ample and specific. It reads as follows: \"The free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall be forever guaranteed by this State; and no person shall be rendered incompetent to be a witness or juror on account of his opinions on matters of religious belief; but the liberty of conscience hereby secured shall not be so construed as to excuse acts of licentiousness, or justify practices inconsistent with the peace or safety of this State.\" The Constitution prohibits the appropriation of money from the State treasury for the use or benefit of any corporation, association, asylum, hospital, or any other institution not under the exclusive management and control of the State as a State institution. But there is, nevertheless, a proviso authorizing the granting of State aid to institutions conducted for the support of maintenance of \"minor orphans, or half-orphans, or abandoned children, or aged persons in indigent circumstances\". The Constitution also expressly prohibits the appropriation of money in support of any sectarian creed, church, or school. The policy of the State is to afford the fullest measure of religious liberty to all, to discriminate in favour of, or against, no one on account of religious belief, and not to permit the power or resources of the State to be used for the propagation of any form of religion or for the benefit of any religious institution. Every Sunday is by express legislative enactment a legal holiday (Civil Code, 7); on that day all courts are closed, and business is universally suspended. Any act required by law or contract to be done or performed on a particular day which happens to fall on a Sunday, may be done or performed on the next day with full legal effect. But there is no law compelling the religious observance of Sunday, and contracts, deeds, wills, notes, etc. executed on Sunday are just as valid as if executed on any other day. But, while there is no Sunday Law, properly so-called, there is an act of the legislature passed 27 February, 1893, securing to all employees one day's rest in seven, and making it a misdemeanor to violate the provisions of the act.\nThe Code of Civil Procedure provides that \"every court, every judge or clerk of any court, every justice and every notary public, and every officer or person authorized to take testimony in any action or proceeding, or to decide upon evidence, has power to administer oaths or affirmations\". Any person who desires it may, at his option, instead of taking an oath, make his affirmation. The Bible is not used in administering oaths; in judicial proceedings, the witness raises his right hand and the clerk or judge swears him \"to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God\". To make a willfully false statement after having taken an oath or affirmation, before an officer authorized to administer it, to testify to the truth, is perjury, a felony punishable by imprisonment in the State's prison for from one to fourteen years. The Penal Code makes it a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of $200 or imprisonment for ninety days, to utter profane language in the presence or hearing of women and children (Penal Code, sect. 415). The Supreme Court of the State, in the case of Delaney, ex parte, California Reports, Vol. XLIII, page 478, has held it to be within the power of a municipal corporation empowered by its charter to prohibit practices which are against good morals, to prohibit and punish the utterance of profane language. The entire matter of profane language is generally left to the control of the local authorities, and most of the counties and cities have ordinances prohibiting and punishing it. It is customary to open the sessions of the legislature with prayer, though there is no provision of law either requiring or prohibiting the practice. There is no recognition of any religious holidays, by name, except Sunday. New Years' Day and Christmas are both holidays, but they are described in the Civil Code merely as \"the first day of January. . .and the twenty-fifth day of December\". It must be said that the same rule is observed in the Code in referring to the other legal holidays. Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, etc. are simply the twenty-second day of February, the thirtieth day of May, the fourth day of July, etc. The seal of confession has the full sanction and protection of the law. It occupies the same position in the eyes of the law as communications made to attorneys and physicians in their professional capacities. It is the policy of the law to encourage these confidential or privileged communications, as they are called, and to keep them inviolate. Section 1881 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that a priest cannot be examined as to any confession made to him, as such, by a penitent.\nThe laws governing the incorporation of churches, and religious societies and providing for the protection and management of church property are both beneficent and effective. The Civil Code (section 602) provides that any bishop, chief priest, or presiding elder, may become a sole corporation by complying with certain simple legal formalities. Thereafter, the usual attributes of corporation aggregate attach, mutatis mutandis, to the corporation sole. Under this statute all Catholic Church property in the Archdiocese of San Francisco is held in the name of \"The Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco\", a corporation sole. Upon the death of the incumbent, his successor, properly appointed and qualified, takes the place of his predecessor, and no probate or other proceedings are required to vest the title to the church property which, in contemplation of law, remains always in the corporation sole, regardless of who may be, for the time being, the incumbent. In addition to the laws governing corporations sole, there are very liberal statutes authorizing the incorporation of single churches, as well as of religious, charitable, and educational associations, and the holding of property by such corporations; also authorizing the consolidation of two or more churches or parishes into one corporation. Under the law of California, therefore, the property interests of the church are jealously safeguarded, and she is free to hold her church property in either of the methods above pointed out. Prior to the year 1900, California stood alone among the States of the Union in taxing church property in the same manner and at the same rate as business or residence property. On 6 November, 1900, the people of the State adopted an amendment to the Constitution, providing that \"all buildings, and so much of the real property on which they are situated as may be required for the convenient use and occupation of said buildings, when the same are used solely and exclusively for religious worship, shall be free from taxation\". The residences of the clergy, the hospitals, orphanages, refuges, asylums, and all other institutions which are devoted to charitable or eleemosynary objects, but which are not used \"solely and exclusively for religious worship\", are still subject to taxation as before. The law exempts \"ministers of religion\" from military duty; and \"a minister of the gospel, or a priest of any denomination following his profession\" is exempt from jury duty.\nThe Civil Code defines marriage as \"a personal relation arising out of a civil contract, to which the consent of parties capable of making that contract is necessary. Consent alone will not constitute marriage; it must be followed by a solemnization authorized by this code\" (55). This section of the code formerly permitted \"a mutual assumption of marital rights, duties or obligations\" to take the place of a solemnization. In other words, the so-called common-law marriages were permitted, and their validity upheld, by the laws of the State. But the difficulty of determining just what constituted \"a mutual assumption of marital rights, duties or obligations\", and the numerous and scandalous cases of intrigue, temporary or illicit relations, hasty, ill-advised, and clandestine unions, with their consequent perplexing questions of legitimacy, succession, property rights, and the status of the parties themselves, convinced the leading minds of California that the position of the Catholic Church on the necessity of the public safeguards with which she protects the marriage ceremony, is the only wise and safe one. Accordingly, in 1895, the legislature amended the law, and made it necessary that the consent of the parties to the marriage be evidenced by a solemnization of the marriage. No particular form of solemnization is required, but the parties must declare in the presence of the person solemnizing the marriage that they take each other as husband and wife. Marriages may be solemnized by a priest, or a minister of any denomination, or by a justice or judge of any court. A license must first be obtained, and the person solemnizing the marriage must attach his written certificate to the license, certifying to the fact, the time, and the place of, and the names and residences of the parties and the witnesses to, the marriage. The license and certificate must then be recorded with the County Recorder. Under these stringent rules little or no difficulty is found in proving a marriage; and all relations between the sexes are simply meretricious unless the parties avail themselves of the legal requirements of solemnization of marriage. There is a charitable provision of the law, designed for the benefit of innocent offspring, to the effect that all children of a marriage void in law or dissolved by divorce are legitimate. The age of consent to marriage is eighteen in males and fifteen in females; but if the male be under the age of twenty-one, or the female under the age of eighteen, the consent of parents or guardian must first be obtained. The law of the State forbids and makes absolutely void marriages: (1) Between whites and negroes, mongolians, or mulattoes; (2) Between ancestors and descendants, brothers and sisters, uncles and nieces, aunts and nephews (marriages between cousins are permitted); (3) If either party be already married, for one year after the entry of an interlocutory decree of divorce. The annulment of marriages is provided for in certain cases; such marriages are considered voidable and may be annulled for any of the following causes: (1) If, at the time of the marriage, either party be under the age of consent, and the consent of parents or guardian be not obtained; (2) If either party be of unsound mind at the time of the marriage; (3) If consent of the marriage be obtained by fraud; or (4) By force, or (5) If either party be physically incapable of entering into the marriage state. The annulment of marriage must carefully be distinguished from divorce. The latter implies the existence of a perfectly valid marriage. The former affords relief to the injured party, who may either ratify the marriage, and thus make it valid from the beginning, or have it set aside and declared void from the beginning.\nThe principle of divorce is recognized by the law of California, which assigns six grounds of divorce: adultery, extreme cruelty, willful desertion, willful neglect (failure to provide), habitual intemperance, and conviction of a felony. Notwithstanding that a cause for divorce be proved to exist, the divorce must be denied upon proof of any of the following: connivance, collusion, condonation, recrimination (proof of a cause of divorce against the plaintiff), or lapse of time. To prevent fraudulent and secret divorces, as well as the promiscuous granting of divorces, the law requires a bona fide residence by the plaintiff for one year in the State, and for three months in the county, before filing suit. Upon dissolution of the marriage by divorce, the Superior Court has jurisdiction to award the care and custody of the children to the innocent party, or to make such other provision for their care and custody as the best interests of the children, both moral and material, may require; and this disposition may be altered from time to time in the discretion of the Court.\nIn 1903 the law on the subject of divorce was amended. Since that year, upon proof by the plaintiff of a cause for divorce, an interlocutory decree of divorce is granted. This decree entitles the successful party to a final decree of divorce upon the expiration of one year after the entry of the interlocutory decree. This change in the law prevents the remarriage of either of the parties until the expiration of one year from the entry of the interlocutory decree.\nAs previously explained, the Church receives no financial aid from the State towards the religious education of her children, and here, as elsewhere, Catholics are taxed for the support of public schools, as well as charged with the duty of maintaining schools of their own. Here also, as elsewhere, the effects of the public school system of non-religous education emphasize the necessity of providing for Catholic youth a complete system of education that includes, with the best profane scholarship, a sound moral and religious training. The need is especially felt in the university courses, whose systems of philosophy, if not positively anti-Christian, are certainly not calculated to foster belief in a personal God, or to strengthen faith in a Divine revelation. There are liberal statutes in force, permitting and encouraging the foundation and maintenance of private institutions of learning, and the only interference permitted the State authorities concerns the supervision of sanitary arrangements, and the prescribing of such standards of scholarship as will entitle graduates to admission to the State University without examination.\nThere are also liberal statutes authorizing the incorporation of religious, social, benevolent, or charitable organizations. Such corporations may make and enforce rules for the government of themselves and their institutions, and may purchase and hold such real property as may be necessary for the objects of the association, not exceeding six whole lots in any city or town, or fifty acres in the country, and the annual profit or income of such land must not exceed $50,000. Orphan asylums, however, maintaining at least 100 orphans are permitted to purchase and hold 160 acres of land, of a net annual value of not more than $50,000. These provisions, it must be remembered, do not limit the power of purely religious corporations, whether sole or aggregate, to purchase and hold such lands as may be necessary for their churches, hospitals, schools, colleges, orphan asylums, and parsonages, under statutes previously discussed. The State Constitution prohibits the appropriating of public money \"for the support of any sectarian or denominational school, or any school not under the exclusive control of the officers of the public schools\"; it also provides that no \"sectarian or denominational be taught, or instruction thereon be permitted, directly or indirectly, in any of the common schools of the State\". Under another constitutional provision already discussed, the legislature passed a law in 1880 appropriating annually to every institution maintaining orphans the sum of $100 for each orphan, and $75 for each half orphan. In 1903 the legislature created a State Board of Charities and Correction, consisting of six members appointed by the governor. This board has a supervisory jurisdiction over all charitable, correctional, and penal institutions, including hospitals for the insane.\nThere is no State law forbidding the sale of liquor to citizens generally. But it is forbidden: to bring intoxicating liquor to a prison, jail, or reformatory; or to sell, give, or expose it for sale within half a mile to a State prison, or within 1,900 feet of a reformatory, or within one mile of the University of California at Berkeley, or within one an one-half miles of any veteran's home, or within the State Capitol, or on the grounds adjacent thereto; or at a camp meeting; or to a common or habitual drunkard; or to an Indian; or to a minor under the age of eighteen years; or within one mile of an insane asylum. It is forbidden to permit a minor under the age of eighteen years to enter a saloon; and it is also forbidden to give or sell intoxicating liquor to anyone on election day. Beyond these provisions, the general law leaves the control of the sale of liquor entirely to local authority. Each county, city, and town is free to regulate the liquor traffic to suit the wishes of its citizens.\nThere are two State prisons, situated respectively at San Quentin and Folsom. These prisons, under the Constitution, are subject to the direct control of the State Board of Prison Directors, consisting of five members appointed by the governor. The prisoners are kept at work, in the rock-crushing plant, in making grain bags, in building roads, etc. Priests and ministers are free to visit the prisoners and conduct religious services for their benefit. There are two State reformatories for juvenile offenders--the Preston School of Industry at Ione City, and the Whittier State School, at Whittier. Each is governed by its own board of trustees, and is entirely independent of the Board of Prison Directors. There is also a juvenile court charged with the control and punishment of juvenile dependents and delinquents. A large discretion is vested with the judge of this court and much good has been accomplished since its creation in keeping children of Catholic parentage under the care and influence of conscientious Catholic officers.\nIn California every person of sound mind who has reached the age of eighteen years may dispose of his entire estate by will, subject to the payment of his debts and expenses of administration. Such part of a decedent's estate as is not disposed of by will is distributed according to the statutes of succession. The estates of such persons as die without wills and without heirs escheat to the State. The phrase \"expenses of administration\" includes funeral expenses of the deceased, expenses of his last illness, and provision for the support of his family, including the homestead, family allowance, and setting apart property exempt from execution.\nNo person is permitted to dispose by will of more than one-third of the value of his estate to charitable uses. A will attempting to dispose of a greater proportion to charity would not be absolutely void, but all the charitable bequests and devises would be reduced proportionately so that their total value would not exceed one third. Moreover, every charitable bequest and devise is absolutely void unless it be made at least thirty days prior to the testator's death. A bequest or devise to a church as such, or to a college, orphan asylum, missionary society, hospital, or home for the aged would be for a charitable use under this provision. But not so a devise or bequest to a priest or bishop by name, and in his individual capacity. It has also been held that a bequest to a priest for Masses to be offered for the repose of the soul of the deceased, is not a charitable bequest.\nCemeteries may be purchased, held, and owned under the liberal statutes for the ownership of church property, already explained. Or, they may be purchased, held, and owned by cemetery corporations formed under a general law, by which their land holdings are limited to 320 acres situated in the county in which their articles of incorporation are filed, or in an adjoining county. The law provides for the survey and subdivision of such lands into lots or plots, avenues or walks, and for the government of such corporations, as well as the sale and tenure of burial plots.\nCLINCH, California and Its Missions (San Francisco, 1904); JAMES, In and Out of the Old Missions (Boston, 1906); JACKSON, California and the Missions (Boston, 1903); BURNETT, Recollections of an Old Pioneer; EDWORDS, California Annual (San Francisco, 1907); U.

{"text":"Unnatural Selection: Choosing Boys Over Girls, and the Consequences of a World Full of Men\nby Mara Hvistendahl\nOne of history's more curious encounters occurred in early March 1766 at a country estate in southern England, near Dorking. The estate belonged to Daniel Malthus, a gentleman of independent means and wide intellectual interests. The philosophers David Hume and Jean-Jacques Rousseau were traveling in the neighborhood, seeking a house for Rousseau, who had just recently arrived in England under Hume's patronage after having been driven out of Switzerland.\nDaniel Malthus was known to both philosophers, at least by correspondence, so they paid him a brief visit, in the course of which they saw his son Thomas, then just three weeks old. So there, presumably in the same room, were Hume, Rousseau, and the infant Thomas Malthus. It was an odd grouping: the serene empiricist, the neurotic social optimist, and the future oracle of demographic doom.\nHume had actually dabbled in demography himself some years earlier. He had been one of the first to argue against the belief, common until his time, that the ancient world was more populous than the modern world. Demography, along with its cousin discipline of economics, was \"in the air\" during the later eighteenth century, waiting for the grown-up Malthus to cast his cold eye upon it in his momentous Essay on the Principle of Population (1798).\nOf these two cousin disciplines, it is a nice point for argument which better deserves to be called \"the dismal science.\" I would vote for demography. It must be hard to maintain a cheerful composure while scrutinizing the ceaseless, often inexplicable ebbs and flows of nativity and mortality.\nIt is a strange thing, too \u2014 and a depressing one for anyone of an empirical temperament \u2014 that what ought to be the most exact of all the human sciences has such a sorry record of prediction. What, after all, could be more certain than that a nation with number N of five-year-olds today will have N fifteen-year-olds in a decade's time, give or take some small margin for attrition and migration? The human sciences don't come any more precise than that. Yet large-scale predictions by demographers have been confounded again and again, from those of Malthus himself to that of Paul Ehrlich, who told us in his 1968 bestseller The Population Bomb that \"The battle to feed humanity is over \u2026 Billions will die in the 1980s.\"\nEhrlich's book was very much of its time. The third quarter of the twentieth century was dogged by fears of a Malthusian catastrophe. Popular fiction echoed those fears in productions like John Brunner's novel Stand on Zanzibar (1968) and Richard Fleischer's movie Soylent Green (1973). It was assumed, reasonably enough, that populous poor countries were most at risk, being closest to the limits of food supply. Governments and international organizations therefore got to work promoting birth control in what we had just recently learned to call the Third World, with programs that were often brutally coercive.\nBirth rates soon fell; though how much of the drop was directly due to the programs, and how much was an inevitable consequence of modernization, is disputed. The evidence is strong that women liberated from pre-modern subordination to their husbands, and given easy access to contraception, will limit their pregnancies with or without official encouragement.\nThere was, though, a distressing side effect of the dropping birthrates. Many countries have a strong traditional preference for male children. So long as women in those countries were resigned to a lifetime of child-bearing, the sheer number of offspring ensured that the sex ratio at birth (SRB) would be close to its natural level of 105 males to 100 females. The post-natal ratio might be skewed somewhat by local traditions of female infanticide and by the loss of young men in war, but a rough balance was kept. China in the 1930s had around 108 males per 100 females.\nOnce the idea of limiting births settled in, however, people sought assurance that one of their babies be male. If a mother gives birth twice, there is a 24 percent chance neither baby will be male; the chance of no males in three births is twelve percent; the chance of no males in four births, six percent. Female infanticide continued to be an option, but not an attractive one \u2014 nor, in most modern jurisdictions, a legal one.\nTechnology met the need by providing methods to determine the sex of a fetus. From the mid-1970s to the early 1980s, amniocentesis was used for this purpose. Then high-quality second trimester ultrasound became widely available and took over the business of fetal sex determination. It caught on very fast all over East and South Asia, allowing women to abort female fetuses. The consequences showed up in last year's Chinese census, whose results are just now being published. They show an SRB of 118 males per 100 females.\nThese unbalanced sex ratios and their social and demographic consequences form the subject matter of Mara Hvistendahl's book Unnatural Selection. An experienced journalist who has lived for many years in China, Ms. Hvistendahl covers the history, sociology, and science of sex-selective population control very comprehensively. She has organized each of her book's fifteen chapters around the experience of some significant individual: \"The Bachelor,\" \"The Parent,\" \"The Economist,\" and so on.\nHer book's scope is by no means restricted to China: \"The Student\" of Chapter 6 is an Indian who commenced his medical training at a big hospital in Delhi in 1978, when sex-selective abortion was just taking off in India. We get a side trip to Albania, whose SRB is treated as a state secret, but seems to be at least 110. We also learn that sex-selective abortion is common among couples of Chinese, Korean, and Indian descent in the U.S.A. The subjects here are not just newly arrived immigrants, either. A research team from Columbia University found that:\nIf anything, mothers who were U.S. citizens were slightly more likely to have sons. Sex selection, in other words, is not a tradition from the old country that easily dies out.\nSouth Korea makes a particularly interesting study. That country's governments were more foresighted than most in spotting the problems that might arise from sex-selective abortion. They outlawed the procedure in 1987, and followed up with rigorous enforcement. South Korea's SRB is now at the natural level.\nThere is more here than meets the eye, though, as Ms. Hvistendahl uncovers. As elsewhere, sex selection was mainly resorted to for second or subsequent births. The SRB for first births is essentially normal worldwide. And first births is wellnigh all the births there are now in South Korea. Our author tells us that: \"In 2005 Korea bottomed out with the lowest total fertility rate in the world, at an average of 1.08 children per woman.\" Things have since recovered somewhat. The 2011 estimate for total fertility rate is 1.23. That still makes for a fast-declining and aging population, though \u2014 surely not the ideal solution to the problem of sex ratio imbalances.\nWhat of the issue of angry young surplus males unable to find wives? Ms. Hvistendahl takes a less alarmist view than the one put forth by Hudson and den Boer in their 2004 book Bare Branches. That there is a causal relationship from excess males to political despotism, as those authors argued, is not well supported by historical evidence. As Hvistendahl notes: \"Adolf Hitler came to power at a time when Germany had over two million more women than men as a result of the toll taken by World War I.\" (She might have added that the most authoritarian episode in recent Indian history was the 1975-77 \"Emergency,\" instigated by a female Prime Minister at a time of normal adult sex ratios.) One feels intuitively that a surplus of sex-starved young men will generate trouble, but on the evidence so far, things may not go beyond domestic disorders of the containable kind.\nMs. Hvistendahl seems to be of conventionally feminist-leftist opinions, but she has visible trouble keeping those opinions in order when writing about sex-ratio imbalances. She of course favors \"reproductive rights,\" yet cannot but deplore the fact that those rights, extended to Third World peasant cultures, have led to a holocaust of female babies and the trafficking of young women from poorer places with low male-female ratios, to wealthier places with high ones.\nShe works hard to develop a thesis about it all having been the fault of Western imperialists terrified of the breeding potential of poorer, darker peoples, in cahoots with opportunistic Third World dictators hungry for World Bank cash, but she cannot quite square the ideological circle. As she points out, abortion was frowned on throughout Asia until modern times. (Chinese people used to consider themselves one year old at birth: older Chinese still reckon their birthdays in this way.) Where would \"reproductive rights\" be in Asia if not for those meddling imperialists?\nThese blemishes are minor, though, and probably inevitable in any book written by a college-educated young woman of our time. If you skip over them, you will find a wealth of research and much good narrative journalism in Unnatural Selection. The occasional feminist, leftist, and anti-American editorializing aside, this is a rich and valuable book on an important topic. David Hume would have admired Hvistendahl's respect for the data, even when it leads to conclusions that make hay of her prejudices. Rousseau would have applauded her egalitarian passions. Thomas Malthus, had he read the book, would have been tearing his hair out.","id":"<urn:uuid:f6399029-a683-4014-83d3-8e457d2526dd>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.johnderbyshire.com\/Reviews\/HumanSciences\/unnaturalselection.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9721161127,"token_count":2060,"score":2.953125,"int_score":3}

{"text":"\"I was born here but I'm not an American\" understanding the U.S. history curriculum through the eyes of Latino students \/\nThe purpose of this investigation was to explore Latino students\u2019 perceptions of\nthe US History curriculum at one high school in the Eastern United States. The ultimate\nobjective was to understand if the US History classes are serving the perceived needs of\nLatino students. Latinos are 40% of our nation\u2019s minorities, are the youngest population\ngroup, and are the fastest growing.\nThe social studies is the ideal curriculum area for challenging the dominant\nworldview and teaching about the diversity present in the classroom, the nation, and the\nworld; therefore, learning more about socio-culturally inclusive social studies curriculum\nand pedagogy is an important consideration. This project is significant because it\nintersects with topics essential to the future of our nation: schools, the social studies\ncurriculum, culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) students, and students\u2019\nperspectives. Furthermore, the focus of this research overlaps with the reality of today\u2019s\neducational system: state content standards and high stakes testing. All of these aspects\nwill be addressed.\nThis study was influenced by Latino Critical Theory. LatCrit is an outgrowth of\nCritical Race Theory (hereafter known as CRT). CRT interrogates how research is\ntraditionally done by forefronting race to demonstrate the depth of inequality that exists\nacross society. LatCrit builds on the five themes of CRT while adding perspectives\nunique to Latino experiences in the United States such as language acquisition, cultural\nbackground, gender, ethnicity, immigration status, and colonial experience.\nData were collected for six months at Crawford High School (name changed).\nThe data sources included observation notes, interview transcripts from students,\nteachers, administrators, and a State Board of Education member, the researcher\u2019s\njournal, and document analysis of the State Social Studies Standards and a practice\nversion of the State Graduation Test.\nData were analyzed utilizing the lens of la frontera. La frontera underscores the\ndisplacement and transitionality of identities, pertinent to the lives of the studentparticipants.\nIn addition, these theories, which manifest themselves as metaphorical\ntropes, compliment LatCrit, the lens through which I view my research.\nThe students made public what is already known: that the educational system\nmust become more culturally inclusive of and responsive to CLD students\u2019 needs.\nHowever, this study revealed data patterns with student participants that have not been\ncaptured within one study. A major finding of this study was that the US History\ncurriculum is or is not meeting student participants\u2019 needs in different ways, based upon\npertinent characteristics of the students. Latino students\u2019 responses were informed by the\nfollowing critical factors: English speaking ability, recency of arrival in the United States,\nand level of integration into the power structures of the state where the research was\ncompleted. The level of integration was further influenced by students\u2019 documentation\nstatus (their legal status in the US), parents\u2019 English speaking ability, and the English\nspeaking ability of members in a student\u2019s residence and immediate neighborhood.\nStudents\u2019 responses fell distinctly into three groups based upon these characteristics.\nThe students in Group One stressed the basic need to learn English. Maslow\ndescribed human motivation with Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs. Perhaps this is what\nstudents in Group One were telling me\u2014their most basic needs had to be met before they\nwould be ready to \u201cgrow\u201d in American schools. Group Two student-participants wanted\ntheir culture to be present so that other students\u2014particularly White students\u2014would\nlearn about them. Group Three students conformed to previous studies conducted with\nWhite students\u2014they wanted to learn in more interactive ways, working with groups, and\nbeing stimulated with flashy videos.\nStudents at Crawford did not have an adequate framework around which to make\nsense of race, racism, and racial tensions. The presence of how race was talked about, and\nthe absence of how race was not talked about, led to negative stereotypes against Latinos\nbased upon ethnicity, immigration status, and native language.

{"text":"|Page (1) of 1 - 03\/02\/13||email article||print page|\nThe Power is in the Pixels: Power Generation Game Added to Thinking Skills Club(March 02, 2013)\nToronto, ON (PRWEB) March 02, 2013\nA steam kettle whistles. The steam activates an electric current causing a beaker of water to heat up and drip onto a turbine, which activates a new current and completes the circuit. Not the usual way to get energy from Point A to Point B, but a creative and compelling way to get to the next level in an online game called Electric Box.\nThe game, hosted by Candystand.com, was recently added to the Thinking Skills Club, an after school club where in grades 3 through 8 play computer games that help kids develop a variety of cognitive skills. Thinking Skills Club founder Mitch Moldofsky says the game was chosen because it employs logic, the concept of cause and effect, planning and making mistakes in order to win. \"Making mistakes is very important in learning,\" says Moldofsky, an educator and Cognitive Science graduate from the University of Toronto, \"I do it all the time.\"\nMoldofsky believes the game encourages the development of executive function skills in the frontal lobes of the brain, based on another executive function training method, Tools of the Mind. \"What they've found with Tools of the Mind is that simply modifying activities during the school day to include things like self-reflection, evaluation, planning and trial and error can radically shape a student's approach to activities outside the classroom as well, such as behavior,\" says Moldofsky. \"Games like these encompass all of these skills.\"\nUnlike other brain training games on the web, which Moldofsky claims are often repetitive and boring, the games on the Thinking Skills Club are \"fun-tested,\" since they are culled from gaming sites. \"These games are already being played by the kids in this age group, without the coercion of parents or teachers. They're intrinsically rewarding,\" he says.\nThere are five other types of games on the Thinking Skills Club aside from executive function, including attention and memory, even social skills. \"There's some good new research out there about the effects of prosocial games,\" says Moldofsky, \"and they're not too hard to find if you know where to look.\"\nRead the full story at http:\/\/www.prweb.com\/releases\/2013\/3\/prweb10486757.htm.\nRelated Keywords:education, adult education, further education, religious education, computing and information technology, satellite technology, wireless technology, science and technology, technology (general), identification technology, agricultural research and technology, plastic art, internet, entertainment award, entertainment (general), arts (general), arts, culture and entertainment, arts, culture and entertainment, entertainment (general), entertainment award, computer crime, Commonwealth Games, Winter Goodwill Games, Summer Asian Games, Winter Asian Games, Panamerican Games, African Games, Mediterranean Games, SouthEast Asiatic Games, PanPacific Games, SouthPacific Games, PanArabic Games, Summer Goodwill Games, World games, paralympic games, government aid, government debt, government contract, education, adult education, further education, religious education, government health care, government, national government, government departments, non government organizations (NGO), family, family planning, market research, research and development, medical research, science and technology, applied science, material science, human science, natural science, philosophical science, research, science (general), animal science, micro science, , weather science, agricultural research and technology","id":"<urn:uuid:1ae9e392-2482-4846-924d-a108adcb5157>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/gamedeveloper.digitalmedianet.com\/article\/The-Power-is-in-the-Pixels:-Power-Generation-Game-Added-to-Thinking-Skills-Club-2460343","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9418705106,"token_count":748,"score":2.90625,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Belgian physicist Francois Englert, left, speaks with British physicist\u2026 (Fabrice Coffrini \/ AFP\/Getty\u2026)\nFor physicists, it was a moment like landing on the moon or the discovery of DNA.\nThe focus was the Higgs boson, a subatomic particle that exists for a mere fraction of a second. Long theorized but never glimpsed, the so-called God particle is thought to be key to understanding the existence of all mass in the universe. The revelation Wednesday that it -- or some version of it -- had almost certainly been detected amid more than hundreds of trillions of high-speed collisions in a 17-mile track near Geneva prompted a group of normally reserved scientists to erupt with joy.\nFor The Record\nLos Angeles Times Friday, July 06, 2012 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 4 News Desk 1 inches; 48 words Type of Material: Correction\nLarge Hadron Collider: In some copies of the July 5 edition, an article in Section A about the machine used by physicists at the European Organization for Nuclear Research to search for the Higgs boson referred to the $5-billion Large Hadron Collider. The correct amount is $10 billion.\nPeter Higgs, one of the scientists who first hypothesized the existence of the particle, reportedly shed tears as the data were presented in a jampacked and applause-heavy seminar at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.\n\"It's a gigantic triumph for physics,\" said Frank Wilczek, an MIT physicist and Nobel laureate. \"It's a tremendous demonstration of a community dedicated to understanding nature.\"\nThe achievement, nearly 50 years in the making, confirms physicists' understanding of how mass -- the stuff that makes stars, planets and even people -- arose in the universe, they said.\nIt also points the way toward a new path of scientific inquiry into the mass-generating mechanism that was never before possible, said UCLA physicist Robert Cousins, a member of one of the two research teams that has been chasing the Higgs boson at CERN.\n\"I compare it to turning the corner and walking around a building -- there's a whole new set of things you can look at,\" he said. \"It is a beginning, not an end.\"\nLeaders of the two teams reported independent results that suggested the existence of a previously unseen subatomic particle with a mass of about 125 to 126 billion electron volts. Both groups got results at a \"five sigma\" level of confidence -- the statistical requirement for declaring a scientific \"discovery.\"\n\"The chance that either of the two experiments had seen a fluke is less than three parts in 10 million,\" said UC San Diego physicist Vivek Sharma, a former leader of one of the Higgs research groups. \"There is no doubt that we have found something.\"\nBut he and others stopped just shy of saying that this new particle was indeed the long-sought Higgs boson. \"All we can tell right now is that it quacks like a duck and it walks like a duck,\" Sharma said.\nIn this case, quacking was enough for most.\n\"If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's probably at least a bird,\" said Wilczek, who stayed up past 3 a.m. to watch the seminar live over the Web while vacationing in New Hampshire.\nCertainly CERN leaders in Geneva, even as they referred to their discovery simply as \"a new particle,\" didn't bother hiding their excitement.\nThe original plan had been to present the latest results on the Higgs search at the International Conference on High Energy Physics, a big scientific meeting that began Wednesday in Melbourne.\nBut as it dawned on CERN scientists that they were on the verge of \"a big announcement,\" Cousins said, officials decided to honor tradition and instead present the results on CERN's turf.\nThe small number of scientists who theorized the existence of the Higgs boson in the 1960s -- including Higgs of the University of Edinburgh -- were invited to fly to Geneva.\nFor the non-VIP set, lines to get into the auditorium began forming late Tuesday. Many spent the night in sleeping bags.\nAll the hubbub was due to the fact that the discovery of the Higgs boson is the last piece of the puzzle needed to complete the so-called Standard Model of particle physics -- the big picture that describes the subatomic particles that make up everything in the universe, and the forces that work between them.\nOver the course of the 20th century, as physicists learned more about the Standard Model, they struggled to answer one very basic question: Why does matter exist?\nHiggs and others came up with a possible explanation: that particles gain mass by traveling through an energy field. One way to think about it is that the field sticks to the particles, slowing them down and imparting mass.\nThat energy field came to be known as the Higgs field. The particle associated with the field was dubbed the Higgs boson.\nHiggs published his theory in 1964. In the 48 years since, physicists have eagerly chased the Higgs boson. Finding it would provide the experimental confirmation they needed to show that their current understanding of the Standard Model was correct.\nOn the other hand, ruling it out would mean a return to the drawing board to look for an alternative Higgs particle, or several alternative Higgs particles, or perhaps to rethink the Standard Model from the bottom up.\nEither outcome would be monumental, scientists said.","id":"<urn:uuid:fb237ffb-9cc0-4077-99d5-56c6fce1ca5f>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/articles.latimes.com\/2012\/jul\/05\/science\/la-sci-higgs-boson-new-particle-20120705","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9634510279,"token_count":1134,"score":2.59375,"int_score":3}
{"text":"United Kingdom - Scotland\nRestrictions of freedom\nMental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003\nThe Act was designed to modernise and improve the use of compulsory measures in mental health care. It reflects the general move over the last two decades towards care and treatment in the community rather than in hospitals or other residential settings. The title reflects the philosophy of the legislation with the focus on \u2018care\u2019 and \u2018treatment\u2019. In basic terms, the Act provides for the protection of people with a mental disorder in a hospital or community setting.\nIt contains mechanisms for dealing with offenders who have a mental disorder and so interacts with the criminal justice system.\nThe Act covers individuals who are defined as having a \u2018mental disorder\u2019. The term includes mental illness, personality disorder and learning disability. The majority of cases involving compulsory measures have been in relation to people diagnosed with a mental illness. However, the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland monitors the use of compulsory measures and has found increasing use of emergency or short term measures being used for people aged over 75 years with a diagnosis of dementia.\nDetention (Involuntary internment)\nThe Act deals with several forms of compulsion in relation to a person with mental disorder where:\nThere is a significant risk to the person\u2019s health, safety or welfare or the safety of any other person (what is a significant risk is a question of judgement for health and social care professionals. The tribunal will test this assessment during an appeal or on an application for a compulsory treatment order).\nTreatment is available to prevent the person\u2019s condition from deteriorating or to relieve its symptoms or effects\nCompulsory admission is necessary because the person will not agree to admission and\/or treatment; and\nThe person\u2019s ability to make decisions about the provision of medical treatment is significantly impaired because of mental disorder.\nTypes of order\nEmergency Detention (72 hours)\nShort Term Detention (28 days and can be extended)\nCompulsory Treatment Order (6 months \u2013 can be extended)\nMental Health Tribunals\nThe Act introduced a new system of mental health tribunals with a number of functions, including considering applications for orders and appeals against orders.\nThis is detention in a psychiatric hospital for up to 72 hours if necessary. It does not authorise any medical treatment. In an emergency, common law powers might be used. A registered medical practitioner can sign an emergency detention certificate if s\/he believes that a person\u2019s ability to make decisions about medical treatment is significantly impaired because of mental disorder. This authorises the removal of the individual to a specific hospital. Before signing the certificate the medical practitioner must be satisfied that:\nThere is an urgent need to detain the person in hospital to access the medical treatment s\/he needs\nIf the person was not detained, there would be a significant risk to his or her health, safety, or welfare or the safety of another person, and\nAny delay caused by starting the short term detention procedure is undesirable.\nIf any treatment is needed the short-term detention procedure must generally be used.\nShort term detention\nThis may be used where it is necessary to detain an individual with mental disorder who cannot be treated voluntarily and without the treatment the person would be at risk of significant harm. To obtain a certificate the approved medical practitioner must consult and gain the approval of a Mental Health Officer whatever the circumstances.\nCompulsory Treatment Order\nCompulsory Treatment Orders (CTOs) are granted by the Mental Health Tribunal. They last for 6 months, can be extended by the responsible medical officer for a further six months and then extended annually. The Tribunal reviews them at least every two years. Therefore, they can restrict or deprive liberty for long periods of time. The Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland looks at how these orders are used for people of different ages and genders to see if there are any trends. Over recent years, the number of new orders has come down. The use of CTOs for people aged 65 and over has increased for people with dementia in recent years.\n\u2018De facto detention\u2019\nPractitioners must be careful that they are not using excessive coercion to prevent people from leaving hospital when they wish to. They must take care to document situations where they have concerns if an informal patient wishes to leave. The Tribunal can, under section 291 of the 2003 Act, order that an informal patient is being unlawfully detained. People with dementia pose a difficult problem. The Tribunal has ruled that a person with dementia is unlawfully detained in a general hospital when prevented from leaving. It can be appropriate to redirect someone and dissuade him\/her from leaving but repeatedly thwarting a determined effort to leave is likely to a significant deprivation of liberty, and the patient should be formally detained.\nAdults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000\nScottish incapacity laws were reformed with the introduction of the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act in 2000. This Act covers people with a mental disorder who lack some or all capacity to make decisions or act in their own interests. It recognises that capacity is not all or nothing but is \u2018decision specific\u2019. The Act introduced a number of measures to authorise someone else to make decisions on behalf of the person with incapacity, on the basis of a set of principles on the face of the Act. These are fundamental. Any action or decision\n- Must benefit the person\n- Must be the least restrictive of the person\u2019s liberty in order to gain that benefit\n- Must take account of the person\u2019s past and present wishes (s\/he must be given assisted to communicate by whatever means is appropriate to the individual)\n- Must follow consultation with relevant others as far as practicable\n- Must encourage and support the person to maintain existing skills and develop new skills.\nThe individual may, whilst competent, appoint one or more persons to act their financial (continuing) and or welfare attorney. This must be registered with the Office of the Public Guardian. It does not allow the attorney to detain the grantor in a psychiatric hospital. If the person refuses to comply with the attorney the attorney has no compulsory powers to detain. Where there is concern for the person\u2019s safety the attorney can apply to the court for a welfare guardianship order. Powers can be granted to allow the guardian to decide on the accommodation of the person and other powers such as who they can consort with. Where the welfare guardian has powers over accommodation s\/he is able to restrict the freedom of the person by placing them in a care home against their will. However, whether this amounts to deprivation of liberty under the European Court of Human Rights ruling will depend on a number of other circumstances and the accumulative impact of which would need to be considered (Patrick and Smith, 2009; Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland, 2011). With regard to the issue of non-compliance, if the person on guardianship, for example, runs away, the guardian can apply to the Court under s70 for an order to require the person to return.\nBecause there is no automatic review of welfare guardianship orders there is concern that the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 may not be compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights. The Act states that the order should be for a standard 3 years but can be more or less at the discretion of the Court. However, there has been a practice of orders being granted for indefinite periods and this has given rise to concern in relation to certain groups. However, for people with dementia, who have a progressive brain disorder, an indefinite order may be deemed appropriate.\nThe Scottish Law Commission is currently undertaking a review of the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 in relation to deprivation of liberty issues. It has established an advisory group of key stakeholders, including Alzheimer Scotland, and will be reporting in due course.\nThe Road Traffic Act of 1991 contains a few articles relating to offences involving driving when unfit to do so, e.g.:\n- A person who causes the death of another person by driving a mechanically propelled vehicle dangerously on a road or other public place is guilty of an offence.\n- A person who drives a mechanically propelled vehicle dangerously on a road or other public place is guilty of an offence.\n- If a person drives a mechanically propelled vehicle on a road or other public place without due care and attention, or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road or place, he (or she) is guilty of an offence.\n- According to the provisions of this act, a person is regarded as driving dangerously if the way s\/he drives falls far below what would be expected of a competent and careful driver and it would be obvious to a competent and careful driver that driving in that way would be dangerous.\nA person who has been diagnosed with dementia must inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA). Failure to do could lead to a fine of up to \u00a31,000. Moreover, a person who had an accident but did not previously inform the DVLA of his\/her dementia might not be covered by his\/her insurance company. Once the DVLA has been informed of that someone has dementia, they send a questionnaire to the person and request a medical report. A driving assessment may also be required. The Medical Advisers at the DVLA then decide whether the person can continue driving (Alzheimer Scotland, 2003).\nPatrick, H. and Smith, N.

{"text":"Reversal of fortune\nTo unlock the vast, untapped potential of the world\u2019s drylands, we must learn from the people who live in them, says Dr Jonathan Davies.\nDrylands are a major global biome, home to a great diversity of species and some of our most treasured natural heritage. They are also home to over 2 billion people and in the developing world in particular they are associated with poverty and social inequity. Global development and environment goals are not being met in the drylands: by 2015 many dryland regions are set to fail to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, whilst progress towards the goals and objectives of the UN environmental conventions (the Convention to Combat Desertification and the Convention on Biological Diversity in particular) is generally poor.\nRecent experiences in the drylands of emerging countries, such as China and India, illustrate that economic development in drylands can outpace that in areas that are usually considered \u201chigh potential\u201d. Although development is often associated with degradation, experiences in Sub Saharan Africa illustrate that economic development can be greatly enhanced through protection of biodiversity as a source of income. By taking an even broader, global view of drylands and examining industrialised dryland countries, it becomes clear that for every seemingly-insurmountable challenge we are able to find evidence of a viable solution somewhere in the world.\nTo address the challenges of the drylands, we need to understand their unique features and how these have to be managed. Perhaps the most important of these is climate unpredictability: the amount of precipitation varies enormously between areas, between seasons and between years. The sheer magnitude of this uncertainty is hard to grasp, but in many drylands the normal range of rainfall, drought-years aside, can be plus or minus 50% of the average. Yet development in many water-deficit areas continues to favour agricultural practices that expose farmers to huge risks whilst simultaneously degrading the natural resource base on which they depend.\nClimate change is a cause for concern in dryland areas, but also an opportunity for new approaches and new learning that illustrate the value of dryland areas. Dryland ecosystems and people are highly adaptable and can survive in their uncertain climate.. Whether drylands become wetter or drier as a result of climate change, they will almost invariably become more unpredictable and their adaptive capacity will be vital to their future. Drylands more than any other ecosystem have the capacity to deal with that unpredictability and we have a great deal to learn from them.\nContrary to popular perception, drylands are not necessarily poverty traps. Dryland ecosystems and their goods and services already contribute significantly to national and international economies. The vibrant tourism sector in Eastern and Southern Africa relies heavily on the biodiversity of drylands. Globally-important dryland commodities include grain, meat and milk and dryland goods like Gum Arabic, Henna, Aloe, and Frankincense. Recent years have seen the commercial development of natural medicines from drylands, and untold numbers of medicinal plants remain un-researched, known only to the dryland inhabitants who have used and conserved them for centuries.\nLocal knowledge of the drylands is rich and is a powerful resource to be harnessed. There has been a tendency to dismiss this knowledge, because local dryland practices have been portrayed as backward or inappropriate and in need of replacing. The current emergency in the Horn of Africa graphically illustrates the outcome of this attitude: populations are exposed to insupportable risk as a result of losing their traditional strategies and being pushed into new ways of life that simply don\u2019t work. Where people are driven towards catastrophe it is almost guaranteed that the environment will face similar consequences. Customs and cultures that are intimately connected to biodiversity become contorted into a system of pure survival where respect for the environment becomes an unaffordable luxury.\nThe scientific explanation of the rationale behind traditional strategies has been known for long enough to develop innovative new approaches to sustainable drylands management. Development support has to enable management of the extreme climatic uncertainty of drylands and needs to be built on understanding of the drivers of continuous change in dryland ecosystems. These are dynamic ecosystems in which adaptation and flexibility are pre-requisites for survival. We need to learn from past failures and successes and ensure that development and humanitarian interventions recognize dryland characteristics and build on local knowledge and capacity to turn the existing opportunities into equitable and sustainable wealth creation. In particular we need to generate greater awareness of the tremendous opportunities for strengthening biodiversity-based livelihoods to diversify dryland economies and strengthen resilience.\nIUCN\u2019s vision 2020 emphasizes the need to strengthen the Union\u2019s work on conserving the diversity of life while also connecting nature conservation to wider societal objectives such as security and poverty reduction. This vision cannot be reached if we fail to understand and address the unique challenges of the drylands. IUCN, with its great diversity of members and commission members, has a vital role to play in securing effective global action to address dryland issues and in enabling dryland communities to develop their nature-based solutions to risk management and sustainable development.\nDr Jonathan Davies is Coordinator of IUCN\u2019s Global Drylands Initiative.","id":"<urn:uuid:f420729b-433d-4fa6-8cfe-c81ae093a2da>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/cms.iucn.org\/knowledge\/focus\/previous_focus_topics\/saving_our_drylands\/opinion\/?8350\/Reversal-of-fortune&add_comment","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9456223845,"token_count":1052,"score":3.265625,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Something astonishing is happening in China. An unfolding story that one Chinese friend told me, \u201ccould be a turning point in conservation and wild bird protection in China.\u201d\nOn Sunday 11 November local people discovered many sick and dying ORIENTAL STORKS (Ciconia boyciana) at Beidagang Reservoir, Tianjin (just 30 mins from Beijing by train). These globally endangered birds - with a restricted range in East Asia \u2013 had been poisoned illegally by poachers using a chemical called carbofuran that, although banned in the EU, Canada and many other countries, is commonly available and used, legitimately, as a pesticide all over China.\nThe storks were possibly unintended victims of well-organised and, sadly, all-too common poaching activity intended to catch swans, ducks and geese for the restaurant trade.\nCarbofuran is mixed with cereal, or given to fish in small man-made pools. Birds lose consciousness after eating the bait, are caught by hand and injected with an antidote. The victims are then shipped \u2013 usually alive \u2013 to restaurants, primarily in southern China. The demand for wild birds is high and they are sold as a delicacy, with many consumers, particularly in southern cities like Guangzhou and Shenzhen, believing that wild birds taste better than farmed produce, and they are prepared to pay a premium. A wild goose or swan can fetch several hundred Yuan (100 Yuan = 10 GBP). The business is highly profitable.\nThe scale of this activity in China, and the range of methods used by poachers to catch wild birds, are covered in an excellent, but sobering, article in the most recent issue of Goose Bulletin. The authors estimate that between 80,000 and 120,000 ducks, swans and geese are caught illegally in China for the restaurant trade every year.\nSo what makes the recent case involving Oriental Storks at Beidagang such a big deal?\nThe answer is the incredible public reaction, led by local people and driven by social media.\nThe events unfolding at Beidagang, although desperately sad, could have been much worse were it not for some dedicated and brave individuals. Local birders, together with volunteers, officials from the Forestry Administration, police and even firemen have been working together to help catch, treat and care for these birds. They have set up 24\/7 patrols to deter the poachers. All of this has been transmitted on social media and the coverage has gone viral. The Chinese micro-blogging service, Weibo, has over 500 million users (on a par with the global membership on Twitter) and activists have been providing regular updates that have been \u2018re-tweeted\u2019 by a growing band of followers. As I write this post, the latest update has been \u2018re-tweeted\u2019 over 900 times to more than a million users in less than one hour.\nThis is leading the traditional print and visual media. Already, we are seeing articles relating to this poisoning incident in Chinese and English language media, both local and national.\nAll of this follows a recent outcry against the illegal trapping and hunting of wild birds in China, also led by social media. Three weeks ago a brave undercover journalist released a shocking video about hunters using spotlights to confuse migrants in Hunan Province before gunning them out of the sky. The Chinese public was outraged and Weibo was alive with condemnation of the hunters and also criticism of the authorities for being slow to act. Shortly after this major outcry, local birders discovered over 2km of illegal mist nets at Beidagang, the site of the current Oriental Stork tragedy. Local activists, many of whom are now on site trying to save the storks, led a \u2018day of action\u2019 involving over 60 volunteers, and even the Chinese army, to take down illegal mist nets in the reedbed. This was covered by local and national TV as well as print media. Due to these two events, the number of articles relating to illegal bird trapping and hunting nationwide has exploded.\nThe campaign to eradicate the illegal hunting of birds is gaining momentum. And the scale of the reaction by ordinary Chinese people all over the country has been overwhelming, demonstrating clearly that the vast majority of Chinese people care deeply about their wild birds. It will be very hard for the authorities to ignore.\nNone of this would be happening without the incredible dedication, passion and energy of a small number of volunteers at Beidagang. There are many people involved but a special mention must go to Xunqiang Mo (aka \u201cNemo\u201d), a local student, and Jingsheng Ma, who have personally led the effort to cut down the illegal nets and are now leading the ongoing operation to save the Oriental Storks. They are heroes in every respect.\nHere is a personal account from yesterday evening, provided by Zhu Lei, a Beijing-based birder monitoring the situation:\n\u201cThere is heart-breaking news. 8 more dead storks been found today, which raise the total number up to 21 !\nThe ground team located 3 evidently man-made small water pools (around diameter of 1m, depth of 0.3m), one of them contained a big empty packing bag (900 g \u00d7 20 packets \u2013 although the scene is absolutely terrible, it does not necessarily mean the whole bag of poison has been used there) of pesticide. We suspect that the poachers have put the toxic chemical directly into the water in these pools or used the same methods as those 2 Jilin guys (filled the fish with toxic, then put into the pools) to poison the birds.\nAccording to signs on the bag, the pesticide used in this massacre is nothing but Carbofuran. The bags were already taken by the police as potential evidence. Some tissue also been taken from the dead birds for further forensic tests. The cause of death will only be revealed as the test report is released (although everything points to it being poisoning with carbofuran).\nThe volunteer team (mostly from the local community and nearby Tianjin city) should be applauded for their hard work. Among them, a bicycle enthusiasts team is worthy of mention for they\u2019ve taken the duty to patrol the dam which surrounds the wetland in daytime, and at least 3 of them have tried hard to wade into the muddy wetland searching for sick birds. Several local rich bird photographers (I think the guys who can afford the big Canon or Nikon big lenses and expensive cameras could be called \u2018rich\u2019) have provided financial support to cover spending such as other volunteers\u2019 accommodation and food, etc.\nPeople from government agencies also contributed to the action. Today, even a team of firemen was called to the spot, due to lack of proper equipment (e.g. waders, boats) to deal with the situation faced in the wetland. They just try to do what they can over there.\n24h ground patrolling has been launched last night, and the patrol has been equipped with night-vision goggles donated by a businessman from Tianjin.\nTomorrow, the team will focus on locating more poisoned lure pools and will destroy them. A plan to provide safe food (mainly small fish) to the storks still at the wetland will be carried out tomorrow.\nSpecial thanks to Nemo for his great devotion and efforts in saving those birds on-site, and kindly receiving my interview tonight. He is a real hero and deserves our highest respect.\u201d\nYou can follow the latest developments with the Oriental Storks at Beidagang and the broader campaign to eradicate illegal mist-netting at this website. Already, many people have expressed their support for these brave and committed individuals and their comments are making a real difference to the volunteers. Knowing that there are people all over the world supporting their efforts is a real boon for them. If you haven\u2019t already, please take a moment to comment to show your support. This could just be the decisive battle in the war against illegal trapping and hunting of wild birds in China.","id":"<urn:uuid:ae31b8ac-dd10-46ca-8429-6076e82025d2>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/birdingfrontiers.com\/2012\/11\/14\/a-turning-point-in-china\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9618424177,"token_count":1658,"score":2.515625,"int_score":3}
{"text":"A Breed Apart :: The \"Pit Bull\" Debunked\nby Lauren Jones Wenzel\n|The term \u201cPit Bull\u201d refers not to a single breed but a group of breeds, including the American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, among others. Most originated from pairings of the ancestors we now call the Olde English Bulldogge and Terriers. Their breeders wanted to merge the muscular body and tenacity of the bulldog with the agility and \u201cgameness\u201d of terriers.|\nOriginally bred for blood sports like bull- and bear-baiting in Europe and North America, these dogs were trained to attack and immobilize the agitated animal and so were favored for their large, strong jaws and muscular necks and shoulders. When these sports were outlawed in the early 1800s, people began fighting the dogs, a sport more easily concealed from the authorities. Since then, their bad reputation, much inflated by the media, has made them the target of unfair discrimination, breed specific legislation (breed banning) and, thanks to their \u201ctough dog\u201d image, a favorite dog in the more illegal enterprises.\n|The truth is that this highly intelligent, energetic, affectionate breed loves people. Pit Bulls were prized as wonderful family dogs in years past. In fact, they once had the moniker of \u201cnanny dog\u201d because of their wonderful demeanor with children.|\nMost experts agree that today\u2019s Pit Bull is a short-coated dog characterized by a wide skull, powerful jaws and a muscular, stocky body. But there is great variation in the Pit Bull\u2019s appearance. Typically 35 to 65 pounds, some weigh as little as 25 pounds, while others tip the scales at 80 pounds or more. While some have bulkier frames and colossal skulls, others have leaner, more muscular bodies. All are strong and athletic. With their impressive stamina and staunch work ethic, Pit Bulls enjoy a variety of sports such as agility, disc dog competitions, flyball, freestyle and competitive obedience. They often excel in weight-pulling contests and schutzhund.\nPit Bulls are typically very friendly, even with strangers. They love people and thrive on attention and affection. Because of their terrier bloodlines, Pit Bulls have a high prey drive, meaning they will frequently chase and grab small animals. Since most terriers were bred for eradicating small rodents, Pit Bulls have a tendency to not get along with other animals, including dogs. This makes their early socialization with other animals especially important.\nPit Bulls also have a tendency to be easily aroused or over-excited and, once riled, it can be difficult for them to calm down, so adequate exercise and training are a must with these dogs. They are not the best choice for the first-time dog owner due to their strength and high energy level and, for the more rambunctious dogs, homes with older children are advised due to their energy and strength.\nBecause of their unfortunate reputation, owning a Pit Bull can be a greater responsibility than owning another breed. It is important that they be well-trained and socialized so they can be good ambassadors for their group. Yet, those dog guardians ready for the challenge and effort of Pit Bull ownership will find it to be one of the most loyal, loving, and wonderful companions on four legs.\n|Did you know that Helen Keller, the famous blind and deaf author, activist, and lecturer of the early 1900s, owned a Pit Bull? Or that Petey from the popular series of the 1920s and 1930s, The Little Rascals, was also a Pit Bull? And during World War I and World War II, Pit Bulls were frequently used to carry messages on the battlefield.|","id":"<urn:uuid:15228cb7-e80c-4164-b2fc-b8e0fed9705b>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.mywoofgang.com\/breed.php","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9715540409,"token_count":786,"score":2.84375,"int_score":3}

Copyright \u00a9 2006 Microsoft Corp.. All rights reserved. This article is reproduced by permission. This tutorial has been edited especially for C# Online.NET. Read the book review!|\n(This article was written and annotated by members of the Microsoft Common Language Runtime (CLR) and .NET teams and other experts.)\nType Design Guidelines in .NET\nFrom the CLR perspective, there are only two categories of types\u2014reference types and value types\u2014but for the purpose of framework design discussion we divide types into more logical groups, each with its own specific design rules. Figure 4-1 shows these logical groups.\nClasses are the general case of reference types. They make up the bulk of types in the majority of frameworks. Classes owe their popularity to the rich set of object-oriented features they support and to their general applicability. Base classes and abstract classes are special logical groups related to extensibility. Extensibility and base classes are covered in Chapter 6.\nInterfaces are types that can be implemented both by reference types and value types. This allows them to serve as roots of polymorphic hierarchies of reference types and value types. In addition, interfaces can be used to simulate multiple inheritance, which is not natively supported by the CLR.\nStructs are the general case of value types and should be reserved for small, simple types, similar to language primitives.\nEnums are a special case of value types used to define short sets of values, such as days of the week, console colors, and so on.\nStatic classes are types intended as containers for static members. They are commonly used to provide shortcuts to other operations.\nDelegates, exceptions, attributes, arrays, and collections are all special cases of reference types intended for specific uses, and guidelines for their design and usage are discussed elsewhere in this book.\n- DO ensure that each type is a well-defined set of related members, not just a random collection of unrelated functionality.\n- It is important that a type can be described in one simple sentence. A good definition should also rule out functionality that is only tangentially related.\n|If you have ever managed a team of people you know that they don't do well without a crisp set of responsibilities. Well, types work the same way. I have noticed that types without a firm and focused scope tend to be magnets for more random functionality, which, over time, make a small problem a lot worse. It becomes more difficult to justify why the next member with even more random functionality does not belong in the type. As the focus of the members in a type blurs, the developer's ability to predict where to find a given functionality is impaired, and therefore so is productivity.|\n|Good types are like good diagrams: What has been omitted is as important to clarity and usability as what has been included. Every additional member you add to a type starts at a net negative value and only by proven usefulness does it go from there to positive. If you add too much in an attempt to make the type more useful to some, you are just as likely to make the type useless to everyone.|\n| When I was learning OOP back in the early 1980s, I was taught a mantra that I still honor today: If things get too complicated, make more types. Sometimes, I find that I am thinking really hard trying to define a good set of methods for a type. When I start to feel that I'm spending too much time on this or when things just don't seem to fit together well, I remember my mantra and I define more, smaller types where each type has well-defined functionality. This has worked extremely well for me over the years. On the flip side, sometimes types do end up being dumping grounds for various loosely related functions. The .NET Framework offers several types like this, such as |","id":"<urn:uuid:6c35af72-3e52-40ad-bf2e-d5f5676c535e>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/en.csharp-online.net\/.NET_Type_Design_Guidelines","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9479852915,"token_count":868,"score":3.0,"int_score":3}
{"text":"This story is from the category Embodiment\nDate posted: 17\/11\/2011\nIf you tell yourself that someone who's being mean is just having a bad day -- it's not about you -- you may actually be able to stave off bad feelings, according to a new study which will be published in an upcoming issue of Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science.\nHaving someone angry at you isn't pleasant. A strategy commonly suggested in cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy is to find another way to look at the angry person. For example, you might tell yourself that they've probably just lost their dog or gotten a cancer diagnosis and are taking it out on you. Stanford researchers Jens Blechert, Gal Sheppes, Carolina Di Tella, Hants Williams, and James J. Gross wanted to study the efficiency and the speed of the process of reappraising emotions. \"You can see this as a kind of race between the emotional information and the reappraisal information in the brain: emotional processing proceeds from the back to the front of the brain, and the reappraisal is generated in the front of the brain and proceeds toward the back of the brain where it modifies emotional processing,\" Blechert says.\nBlechert and his colleagues came up with two experiments to study this process. Participants were shown several series of faces and tested on their reactions. For example, in one set, they were told to consider that the people they'd seen had had a bad day, but it's nothing to do you with you. \"So we trained the participants a little bit, not to take this emotion personally, but directed at someone else,\" Blechert says.\nThey found that, once people had adjusted their attitude toward someone, they weren't disturbed by that person's angry face the next time it appeared. On the other hand, when participants were told to just feel the emotions brought on by an angry face, they continued to be upset by that face. In a second study, the researchers recorded electrical brain activity from the scalp and found that reappraising wiped out the signals of the negative emotions people felt when they just looked at the faces.\nPsychologists used to think that people had to feel the negative emotion, and then get rid of it; this research suggests that, if people are prepared, it's actually a much faster and deeper process.\n\"If you're trained with reappraisal, and you know your boss is frequently in a bad mood, you can prepare yourself to go into a meeting,\" says Blechert, who also works as a therapist. \"He can scream and yell and shout but there'll be nothing.\" But this study only looked at still pictures of angry faces; next, Blechert would like to test how people respond to a video of someone yelling at them.\nSee the full Story via external site: www.sciencedaily.com\nMost recent stories in this category (Embodiment):\n04\/05\/2013: Bielefeld robots take part in a space simulation","id":"<urn:uuid:8536c70e-54bc-48de-b0e5-10d94957b166>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.virtualworldlets.net\/Archive\/IndividualNews.php?News=8599","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9751833081,"token_count":622,"score":3.046875,"int_score":3}

{"text":"TAKING EVERY PRECAUTION\nJapan Takes Measures to Prevent SARS (June 9, 2003)\nAs severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a new type\nof pneumonia, rages in wide areas of Asia and other places, the Japanese government\nhas been busy taking measures to prevent an outbreak from occurring in Japan.\nThe government has urged people to take caution in traveling to affected areas,\nand it has been making every effort to prevent SARS from entering Japan. In addition,\nwork is progressing on a system in which medical institutions, national and local\ngovernments, and corporations will act together to prevent the spread of SARS\nin the event of an outbreak in Japan. As a result of these efforts, as of June\n9, there have been no confirmed or probable cases of SARS in Japan.\n|Medical staff practice using an isolator. (Jiji)\nPlans Already Developed for Dealing with Patients\nOn May 1 the government brought the heads of the relevant ministries and agencies\ntogether for a first-ever meeting devoted to SARS in order to decide what measures\nshould be taken in the event that someone in Japan is found to be infected with\nthe virus. The group decided to call on people returning from China to stay at\nhome for 10 days, which is believed to be the incubation period for the disease.\nTaking this into consideration, the\nMinistry of Health, Labor, and Welfare made plans for taking action in the\nevent of an outbreak. It decided to give local governments the authority to direct\npeople believed likely to be infected, or \"probable patients,\" to hospitalize\nthemselves. In the event that a patient refuses, the local governments are empowered\nto forcibly hospitalize the person.\nLocal governments are readying themselves to accept patients. According to a survey\nconducted by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun in early May,\nall of the nation's 47 prefectures had already completed action plans spelling\nout what measures would be taken in the event of an outbreak. In addition, some\n250 medical institutions around the country have made such preparations as setting\nup \"negative air-pressure rooms\" to prevent the virus from spreading\nwithin the hospital or to the outside. Local governments in such places as Kitakyushu\nCity, Hokkaido, and Mie Prefecture\nhave been purchasing capsules called isolators to be used when suspected SARS\npatients are moved, and they have conducted drills on how to use them with volunteers\nplaying the role of patients.\nIn May a foreign traveler who had been to Japan was found to be infected with\nSARS. When this was discovered, the government and local authorities quickly implemented\nemergency measures, as a result of which no secondary infections occurred. According\nto a survey conducted by the Asahi Shimbun, 28 local\ngovernments out of the 47 prefectures and 13 major cities in Japan, nearly half\nthe total, were rethinking their plans to cope with a potential SARS outbreak\nin light of this news. Fukushima Prefecture decided to check whether visitors\nfrom abroad have come from an area to which the World\nHealth Organization recommends postponing travel. It will also make use of\nthe local hotels association to determine the previous whereabouts of such guests.\nKagawa Prefecture, meanwhile, which had previously only planned for people who\nhad come in close contact with SARS patients, defined as having been within 2\nmeters, has created an action plan for checking on people who have had even a\nlow possibility of coming in contact with a carrier.\nPublic and Private Sectors Taking Action\nThe Japanese government is stepping up its efforts to take rapid, nationwide measures\nto prevent SARS infection. The Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare has accelerated\nrevision of the Infectious Disease Law, for example. And while local governments\nare the first line of defense in tracking the path of infection and following\nup on people who may have been exposed, the national government will become directly\ninvolved in the event that infection spreads outside of a local area. Japan is\nalso actively engaged in international cooperation aimed at preventing the spread\nThe private sector has also been taking action to prevent\nthe spread of SARS and to reassure travelers. West\nJapan Railway Co. (JR West) has set up a SARS-response headquarters and is\nconsidering disinfecting affected carriages in the event that an infected person\nis found to have been onboard a certain train at a certain time. The company also\ndecided to publicly release information on the time and route traveled by any\nSARS patients. Orient Ferry, which runs a ferry route from Shimonoseki to China's\nQingdao, has since late April requested that all passengers and crew fill out\nhealth questionnaires, and the company has trained staff for what to do in the\nevent that a passenger falls ill with SARS while onboard. The terminal in Qingdao,\nthe shuttle bus, and the inside of the ship are all disinfected every day.\nMeanwhile, some companies have taken the step of postponing scheduled business\ntrips to affected areas, and, in response to requests by the government, airlines\nand ship operators whose vessels operate in Japan are distributing health questionnaires\nto their staff and passengers.\nJapan has avoided SARS so far, and there is every reason to be confident that\nthe country will remain free of the disease. Even if an outbreak did occur, the\nconcerted efforts of local and national governments and private enterprises to\nprepare for such an eventuality suggest that it would be handled quickly and efficiently.\nNote: The government's \"Measures upon Entry\/Return to Japan\" for travelers\nheading to Japan can be found here.

{"text":"Martial arts is the collective name given to a variety of hand-to-hand fighting styles, or fighting styles that involve weapons that are used as an extension of the body. Most fighting styles are unique to a particular culture, such as Karate to Japan, and TaeKwonDo to Korea. While many have roots in the period BC, there are variations of the styles that evolved in the last 200 years.\nInterestingly enough, Karate is more of an anti-martial art, designed to help common folk prepare to fight against martial rule, during a time of weapons bans. Kara te do means \"empty hand way\" referencing this style without weapons. TaeKwonDo means \"the way of the hands and feet\".\nMost martial arts were originally intended to be used for serious fighting, but in the modern age they are mainly practised as sports, with strictly codified rules; indeed some, such as Judo, were developed from other martial arts purely for sporting purposes.

{"text":"Research finds novel airborne germ-killing oral spray effective in fighting colds and flu\nUniversity Hospitals Case Medical Center clinical researchers will present findings about a one-two punch to prevent colds and flu in San Francisco at the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) on September 9, 2012.\nThe research team is presenting data in two poster presentations that a new oral antiseptic spray is effective in killing 99.9 percent of infectious airborne germs. Findings from these two presentations led to the development of Halo Oral Antiseptic, a first-of-its kind germ-fighting spray which is currently on store shelves.\n\"Respiratory tract disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world,\" says Frank Esper, MD, infectious disease expert at UH Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital and lead author of one of the studies. \"Yet there has been limited progress in the prevention of respiratory virus infections. Halo is unique in that it offers protection from airborne germs such as influenza and rhinovirus.\"\nDr. Esper and a team of researchers used glycerine and xanthan gum as a microbial barrier combined with cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) as a broad-spectrum anti-infective agent to fight respiratory illnesses. To test this, clinical strains of 2009 pandemic H1N1 were used as a prototype virus to demonstrate Halo's anti-infective activity in cell culture assays. \"The glycerine and xanthan gum prevent the germs from entering a person's system and the CPC kills the germs once they're trapped there,\" explains Dr. Esper, who is also Associate Professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine.\nDr. Esper will present his findings that Halo will have clear benefit to aid against infection and reduce disease from epidemic, sporadic or pandemic respiratory viral infections, particularly helping people at risk for severe respiratory illness including immune-compromised individuals with chronic lung disease, and military personnel.\nAnother study on Halo will be presented by Mahmoud Ghannoum, PhD, of UH Case Medical Center, showing Halo's effectiveness against disease-causing pathogenic germs. The presentation asserts that respiratory and\/or systemic infections through airborne and manually transmitted pathogenic microbes often enter the system through the mouth, making Halo, an oral spray that targets these pathogens, an effective way to prevent infections. Additionally, preliminary data from the researchers found that Halo completely kills all 11 clinical strains of whooping cough (Bordetella pertussis) against which the spray was tested.\nThe results showed that when a person used three sprays of Halo, it destroyed airborne germs breathed in for up to six hours, even when people were eating and drinking. The concept of coating the back of the oral cavity to prevent germs from entering and then providing sustained antiseptic action to kill airborne germs was developed by a Cleveland company, Oasis Consumer Healthcare.\n\"Exposure to airborne germs is inevitable \u2013 especially in crowded environments and when traveling,\" said Dr. Ghannoum, who is also the Director of the Center for Medical Mycology at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. \"Unlike other products that support the immune system or protect from germs on surfaces or hands, Halo is the first and only product of its kind to offer protection from airborne germs.\"\nProvided by University Hospitals Case Medical Center\n- New study finds resistant organisms at core of soft contact lens corneal infections Jan 28, 2008 | not rated yet | 0\n- Give dirty mouths a brush Apr 13, 2010 | not rated yet | 0\n- Sharing musical instruments means sharing germs May 12, 2011 | not rated yet | 0\n- New AIDS-like disease in Asians, not contagious Aug 22, 2012 | not rated yet | 0\n- Bus, tram passengers warned to keep germs to themselves Jan 18, 2011 | not rated yet | 0\n- Motion perception revisited: High Phi effect challenges established motion perception assumptions Apr 23, 2013 | 3 \/ 5 (2) | 2\n- Anything you can do I can do better: Neuromolecular foundations of the superiority illusion (Update) Apr 02, 2013 | 4.5 \/ 5 (11) | 5\n- The visual system as economist: Neural resource allocation in visual adaptation Mar 30, 2013 | 5 \/ 5 (2) | 9\n- Separate lives: Neuronal and organismal lifespans decoupled Mar 27, 2013 | 4.9 \/ 5 (8) | 0\n- Sizing things up: The evolutionary neurobiology of scale invariance Feb 28, 2013 | 4.8 \/ 5 (10) | 14\nClassical and Quantum Mechanics via Lie algebras\nApr 15, 2011 I'd like to open a discussion thread for version 2 of the draft of my book ''Classical and Quantum Mechanics via Lie algebras'', available online at http:\/\/lanl.arxiv.org\/abs\/0810.1019 , and for the...\n- More from Physics Forums - Independent Research\nMore news stories\nNo new human cases of the H7N9 virus have been recorded in China for a week, national health authorities said, for the first time since the outbreak began in March.\nDiseases, Conditions, Syndromes 33 minutes ago | not rated yet | 0\nA Nobel prize-winning scientist Tuesday played down \"shock-horror scenarios\" that a new virus strain will emerge with the potential to kill millions of people.\nDiseases, Conditions, Syndromes 51 minutes ago | 5 \/ 5 (1) | 0\nBacteria resistant to the antibiotic colistin are also commonly resistant to antimicrobial substances made by the human body, according to a study in mBio, the online open-access journal of the American Society for Microb ...\nDiseases, Conditions, Syndromes 5 hours ago | 5 \/ 5 (1) | 0\n(AP)\u2014Federal investigators probing the hantavirus outbreak blamed for three deaths at Yosemite National Park recommend that design changes to tent cabins and other lodging run by private concessionaires first be reviewed ...\nDiseases, Conditions, Syndromes 11 hours ago | not rated yet | 0\nA new diagnostic test for a worm infection that can lead to severe enlargement and deformities of the legs and genitals is far more sensitive than the currently used test, according to results of a field ...\nDiseases, Conditions, Syndromes 12 hours ago | not rated yet | 0 |\n(Medical Xpress)\u2014A three-year multinational study has tracked and detailed the progression of Huntington's disease (HD), predicting clinical decline in people carrying the HD gene more than 10 years before ...\n44 seconds ago | not rated yet | 0\n1 hour ago | not rated yet | 0 |\n(Medical Xpress)\u2014A research team, led by Jeremy Barr, a biology post-doctoral fellow, unveils a new immune system that protects humans and animals from infection.\n11 hours ago | 4.6 \/ 5 (13) | 5 |\nNew research suggests that a compound abundant in the Mediterranean diet takes away cancer cells' \"superpower\" to escape death.

{"text":"The Americas IBA Directory\nThe conservation of rare birdlife has been the focus of Birdlife International for many years. In 1995 they began a project by the name of IBA, or Important Bird Area Program, to pinpoint areas across the globe that are home to endangered species, identifying the various species and protecting those areas to assist in conserving vital birdlife. At present, more than ten thousand of these areas have been identified, and conservation and environmental initiatives have been implemented. Now a new program has been established, namely the Americas IBA Directory.\nHundreds of bird species will benefit from the Americas IBA Directory, as it will be a guideline for both conservationists and for authorities. The directory covers 57 different countries and has 2 345 of the most significant areas listed that need to be protected at all costs. Authorities will be able to refer to the directory to find out which of their areas are vital to the survival of birdlife, which bird species are located in that area and the biodiversity of the area, to enable them to take the right steps in protecting the natural habitat and the birds. Some areas that have been listed are significant in the migratory patterns of certain species, while others are crucial nesting sites for numerous endangered birds. Due to a number of these areas being inhabited by local communities, also relying on the natural resources such as water, authorities can assist these communities with sustainable development that will not only benefit the communities but the birdlife as well.\nHundreds of organizations have provided support and assistance in the compiling of the Americas IBA Directory. President of Bird Studies Canada, George Finney, explained: \u201cFrom breeding grounds in Canada, to wintering sites in the south, and all points in between, it is imperative that we understand what is happening to bird populations and the forces that drive change. Bird Studies Canada is proud to work closely with our international partners on this issue, so that better management decisions and conservation actions can be taken.\u201d A large number of agencies will be working together as IBA Caretakers, tracking migratory patterns and data in regard to bird populations, to note changes being made by the birds, and keeping the IBA Directory as up to date and accurate as possible.","id":"<urn:uuid:952beb80-6af2-4d67-a30b-a71f85aae699>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.birds.com\/blog\/the-americas-iba-directory\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9612936974,"token_count":448,"score":3.3125,"int_score":3}

{"text":"The word vivisection was first coined in the 1800s to denote the experimental dissection of live animals - or humans. It was created by activists who opposed the practice of experimenting on animals. The Roman physician Celsus claimed that in Alexandria in the 3rd century BCE physicians had performed vivisections on sentenced criminals, but vivisection on humans was generally outlawed. Experimenters frequently used living animals. Most early modern researchers considered this practice acceptable, believing that animals felt no pain. Even those who opposed vivisection in the early modern period did not usually do so out of consideration for the animals, but because they thought that this practice would coarsen the experimenter, or because they were concerned that animals stressed under experimental conditions did not represent the normal state of the body.\nPrompted by the rise of experimental physiology and the increasing use of animals, an anti-vivisection movement started in the 1860s. Its driving force, the British journalist Frances Power Cobbe (1822-1904), founded the British Victoria Street Society in 1875, which gave rise to the British government's Cruelty to Animals Act of 1876.

{"text":"Smoke Detectors, Carbon Monoxide Detectors, Gas Detectors\nSMOKE DETECTOR INFORMATION:\nMost people are aware of the danger of fire but are unaware of the fatality of smoke. More people die from breathing smoke than by burns. In fact, deaths from smoke inhalation outnumber deaths by burning by 2:1. In a hostile fire, smoke and deadly gases tend to spread farther and faster than heat from flames. Moreover, when people are asleep, deadly fumes can send them deeper into unconsciousness.\nSmoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors are a powerful and effective fire safety technology. They are the first lines of defense against smoke and fire. They may awaken those who would otherwise have been overcome by smoke and toxic gases in their sleep. And most importantly, they provide an early warning alerting individuals of a fire, allowing them precious time to escape.\nAccording to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), 75 to 80% of all deaths by fire happen in the home. More than half of these deaths occurred in buildings without smoke detectors. By installing a smoke detector, individuals can reduce the risk of dying by almost 50%.\nIonization smoke detectors monitor 'ions,' or electrically charged particles in the air. Air molecules in a sample chamber of ionization smoke detectors, are 'ionized' by a radioactive source. This allows a small electrical current flow. Smoke particles entering the sensing chamber change the electrical balance of the air. The greater the amount of smoke, the higher the electrical imbalance. When combustion particles enter the smoke detector, they obstruct the flow of the current. An alarm is pre-programmed to sound when the current gets too low.\nIonization smoke detectors respond first to fast flaming fires. A flaming fire devours combustibles extremely fast, spreads rapidly and generates considerable heat with little smoke.\nIonization alarms are best suited for rooms, which contain highly combustible material. These types of material include:\n1. Cooking fat\/grease 2. Flammable liquids 3. Newspaper 4. Paint 5. Cleaning solutions\nSmoke alarms with ionization technology are the most popular types sold in the United States.\nThe NFPA recommends smoke alarms be installed in EVERY room and area of your home or bulding for complete protection. For maximum protection, install at least one ionization and one photoelectronic smoke alarm on each level of your home.\nAll smoke alarms should be replaced after 10 years of operation. Ten years is a smoke alarm's useful lifetime and for continued, reliable safety and protection, smoke alarms need to be replaced.\nConsumer's should consult their owner's manual for specific instructions when locating a smoke alarm. The following are some general guidelines:\nBecause smoke rises, smoke alarms should be installed on the ceiling or on walls at least 4 to 6 inches below the ceiling.\nSmoke alarms should not be located less than 4 to 6 inches from where the wall and ceiling meet on either surface; this space is dead air that receives little circulation.\nSmoke alarms should not be mounted in front of an air supply, return duct, near ceiling fans, peaks of A-frame ceilings, dusty areas, locations outside the 40 degree Farenheit to 100 degree Farenheit temperature range, in humid areas or near fluorescent lighting.\nIf you hear the smoke alarm, roll to the floor and crawl to the door. Stay low where the air is cleaner and cooler. Touch the door. If the door feels cool, open it just a crack and check for smoke. If there is no smoke, leave by your planned escape route. Crawl and keep your head down. If the door feels hot, do not open it. Do no panic. Escape out the window or use an alternate exit.\nIf you can't leave your room, seal the cracks around the doors and vents as best you can. Use a wet towel or clothing if possible. Open a window at both the top and bottom. Stay low and breathe fresh air. Shout for help and signal your location by waving a bright cloth, towel or sheet out of a window.\nIf you live in a high rise building, never use the elevator to escape fire. If the fire blocks your exit, close your apartment door and cover all cracks where smoke could enter. Telephone the fire department, even if fire fighters are aleready at the scene, and tell them where you are. Shout for help and signal your location by waving a bright cloth, towel or sheet out of a window.\nIf your clothes catch on fire, \"Stop, Drop and Roll\" to put out the flames. Do not run-running will only increase the flames.\nPhotoelectronic alarms contain a light emitting diode (LED) which is adjusted to direct a narrow infrared light across the unit's detection chamber. When smoke particles enter this chamber they interfere with the beam and scatter the light. A strategically placed photodiode monitors the amount of light scattered within the chamber. When a pre-set level of light strikes the photodiode, the alarm is activated.\nPhotoelectronic smoke alarms respond first to slow smoldering fires. A smoldering fire generates large amounts of thick, black smoke with little heat and may smolder for hours before bursting into flames.\nPhotoelectronic models are best suited for living rooms, bedrooms and kitchens. This is because these rooms often contain large pieces of furniture, such as sofas, chairs, mattresses, counter tops, etc. which will burn slowly and create more smoldering smoke than flames. Photoelectronic smoke alarms are also less prone to nuisance alarms in the kitchen area than ionization smoke alarms.\nThe use of both ionization and photoelectronic smoke alarms will provide a home with maximum protection and an ample warning in the event of a fire.\nFamilies should get together and draw a floor plan of their home. They should show two ways out of every room. The first way should be out a door and the second way could be through a window. If it is a second or third story window, they might consider purchasing a safety ladder. They should choose a meeting place for all family members outside the home and mark it on the plan. A good meeting place would be a driveway, tree or a neighbor's home.\nFamilies should practice the escape plan to make sure everyone understands the planned routes. Involve every member of the family. Start with everyone in their beds with the doors closed. Have one person sound the smoke alarm. Have each person touch his or her door. (Tip: sleep with bedroom doors closed. A closed door will help show the spread of fire, smoke and heat). Practice low escape routes-one for a cool door and one for a hot door. Meet outdoors at the assigned meeting place. Designate one person to call the fire department. Make sure everyone knows the fire department or local emergency telephone number.\nConsumers should be advised of the following features when choosing a smoke alarm to best suit their needs:\nSmoke detectors with an alarm silencer feature will silence an alarming unit for several minutes, giving the air time to clear. These models are idal near kitchen and cooking areas where most nuisance alarms occur. Note: consumers should always determine the reason for the unit sounding before quickly dismissing it as a nuisance alarm and pressing the alarm silencer feature to silence the alarm.\nLong Life Smoke Detectors\nThe NFPA reports that 1\/3 of all smoke detectors installed in homes are not operating because of dead or missing batteries. This is an all too common occurrence in smoke detectors that leaves families and homes vulnerable.\nLong life smoke detectors utilize lithium batteries that provide up to 10 years of continuous protection. Lithium batteries eliminate the need and expense of semi-annual battery replacement. When long life smoke detectors near the end of their tenth year in operation, they will sound a low battery signal to remind consumers to replace the entire unit.\nNote: it is recommended that smoke detectors be replaced every 10 years and be tested regularly.\nSome smoke detectors have a built-in emergency light that will turn on when the unit goes into alarm. The emergency light will illuminate an escape route in case of a power failure. These units are best utilized when installed by stairs and in hallways.\nHardwire smoke detectors are connected to a home's AC power supply and should be intalled by a licensed electrician according to the local electrical code. AC power means you never have to replace a battery to protect your home and family.\nCARBON MONOXIDE DETECTOR INFORMATION:\nCarbon monoxide poisoning is often confused with the flu. It is important that you discuss with all family members the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning. Different carbon monoxide concentrations and exposure times cause different symptoms. Remember, carbon monoxide detectors are your first defense against carbon monoxide poisoning.\nEXTREME EXPOSURE: Unconsciousness, convulsions, cardiorespiratory failure, and death\nMEDIUM EXPOSURE: Severe throbbing headache, drowsiness, confusion, vomitting, and fast heart rate\nMILD EXPOSURE: Slight headache, nausea, fatigue (often described as 'flu-like' symptoms)\nFor most people, mild symptoms generally will be felt after several hours of exposure of 100 ppm's of carbon monoxide.\nMany reported cases of carbon monoxide poisoning indicate that while victims are aware they are not well, they become so disoriented that they are unable to save themselves by either exiting the building or calling for assistance. Also, due to small size, young children and household pets may be the first affected.\nIf left unchecked, a child's exposure to carbon monoxide can lead to neurological disorders, memory loss, personality changes and mild to severe forms of brain damage.\nIf a child complains or shows signs of headaches, dizziness, fatigue or nausea or diarrhea, he or she could have carbon monoxide poisoning. Be especially aware of symptoms that disappear when the child is out of the house and reappear upon return, or symptoms that affect the entire household at once.\nSince the symptoms closely mimic viral conditions such as the flu, without the fever, carbon monoxide poisoning is often treated improperly, if at all.\nA physician can perform a simple blood test (called a carboxyhemoglobin test) to determine the level of carbon monoxide in the bloodstream. If elevated levels of carbon monoxide are present, hyperbaric (high-pressure) oxygen treatment may be used to rid the body of carbon monoxide. A physician will make this determination and administer treatment if necessary.\nChildren with carbon monoxide poisoning have mistakenly been treated for indigestion.\nThe following are considerations consumers should be advised to take when choosing a carbon monoxide detector that will be sure to meet their needs.\n1. Consumers should consider ease of installation, the location of installation and the power source of an alarm when choosing a plug-in, battery powered or hardwire model.\nPlug-in units are designed to directly plug into a standard 120-volt electrical outlet for simple installation. This location provides easy access for both testing and resetting the detector. In addition, the location provides both a visual and audible difference from a ceiling mounted smoke alarm, which may help to eliminate confusion during an emergency alarm condition. A plug-in unit also requires no additional costs for annual battery replacement.\nBattery powered units can be easily mounted to a wall or ceiling if the consumer wishes to keep electrical outlets free, if they wish to keep the unit relatively out of sight, or if they would like to keep the alarm away from the reach of children. Some battery-powered units are portable alarms that work anywhere--no installation required. These units may be mounted to a wall, left on a tabletop or carried while traveling. Battery powered units require battery replacement every year, similar to smoke alarms. These units will have a low battery-warning signal to indicate when the batteries need repacing.\nHardwire units are powered by wiring the unit directly into a household's AC power supply at a junction box. A licensed electrician according to the local electrical code should install them. The unit can be permanently installed to prevent tampering.\n2. Consumers should choose a carbon monoxide detector with the features (e.g. low level warning, battery back up, digital display, etc.) that meet their needs.\nLow Level Warning-some carbon monoxide alarms sound a warning (e.g. 3 short beeps) when a low level of carbon monoxide has been detected. Low levels of carbon monoxide can be hazardous over a long period of time. Low level warnings flag potential carbon monoxide problems and allow consumers time to respond to them before an emergency situation arises.\nBattery Backup-some plug-in carbon monoxide alarm models have a back-up power source that allows the unit to function in the event of a main line power failure. During a power outage, people are likely to use alternate sources of power, light and heat (e.g. kerosene heaters, gas-powered portable generators and fireplaces) which may be out of tune and may produce deadly carbon monoxide gas.\nDigital Display-some carbon monoxide alarms have a digital display that shows the levels of carbon monoxide in the air in parts per million (ppm). For some people, this added feature provides at-a-glance peace of mind.\n3. Consumers should choose an alarm that has been accuracy tested.\nAmerican Sensors(TM), guarantees each of its alarms to be Triple Accuracy Tested(TM).\nAmerican Sensors'(TM) triple Accuracy Testing process exposes every alarm to three separate tests during manufacturing. This testing process includes twice exposing the alarm to carbon monoxide to precisely calibrate each unit. One test is at high levels and the second is at lower levels of carbon monoxide. In the third step, every alarm is tested to protect against nuisance alarms.\nThis stringent method of testing and quality control helps ensure that every American Sensors(TM) carbon monoxide alarm will provide years of reliable, accurate protection for your family and home.\n4. Consumers should compare alarm warranties and note hidden operating costs.\nConsumers should select an alarm that offers a comprehensive warranty. The alarm's warranty should include its sensor. Consumers should be advised that some CO alarms require the purchase of an expensive replacement sensor and\/or battery pack as an ongoing expense. American Sensors(TM) alarms do not require replacement sensors and carry a 5 year warranty.\n5. Check that the product is Listed by Underwriters Laboratories Inc. UL 2034 and\/or Underwriters' Laboratories of Canada.\nConsumers should avoid any brand that does not bear the mark of Underwriters Laboratories Inc. and\/or Underwriters' Laboratories of Canada.\nAll American Sensors(TM) carbon monoxide alarms meets and\/or exceeds the latest stringent standards of Underwriters Laboratories Inc. and\/or Underwriters' Laboratories of Canada.\nCarbon monoxide is generated through incomplete combustion of fuel such as natural gas, propane, heating oil, kerosene, coal, and charcoal, gasoline or wood.\nThis incomplete combustion can occur in a variety of home appliances. The major cause of high levels of carbon monoxide in the home is faulty ventilation of funaces, hot water heaters, fireplaces, cooking stoves, grills and kerosene heaters.\nOther common sources are car exhausts, and gas or diesel powered portable machines.\nFaulty or improper ventilation of natural gas and fuel oil furnaces during the cold winter months accouts for most carbon monoxide poisoning cases.\nCorrect operation of any fuel burning equipment requires two key conditions. There must be:\n* An adequate supply of air for complete combustion.\n* Proper ventilation of fuel burning appliances through the chimney, vents or duct to the outside.\nInstall carbon monoxide alarms as a first line of defense against poisoning. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission recommends installing at least one carbon monoxide alarm with an audible alarm near the sleeping areas in every home. Install additional alarms on every level and in every bedroom to provide extra protection.\nCarbon monoxide poisoning can happen anywhere and at any time in your home. However, most carbon monoxide poisoning cases occur while people are sleeping. Therefore, for the best protection, a carbon monoxide alarm should be installed in the sleeping area.\nApproximately 250 people in the US died last year from the 'silent killer'-carbon monoxide. The safety experts at Underwriter's Laboratories Inc. (UL) recommend that consumers follow these steps to help prevent carbon monoxide poisoning.\n1. Have a qualified technician inspect fuel-burning appliances at least once a year. Fuel-burning appliances such as furnaces, how water heaters and stoves require yearly maintenance. Over time, components can become damaged or deteriorate. A qualified technician can identify and repair problems with your fuel-burning appliances. Carbon monoxide detectors can detect a carbon monoxide condition in your home.\n2. Be alert to the danger signs that signal carbon monoxide problems, e.g., streaks of carbon or soot around the service door of your fuel burning appliances; the absence of a draft in your chimney; excessive rusting on flue pipes or appliance jackets; moisture collecting on the windows and walls of furnace rooms; fallen soot from the fireplace; small amounts of water leaking from the base of the chimney, vent or flue pipe; damaged or discolored bricks at the top of your chimney and rust on the portion of the vent pipe visible from outside your home.\n3. Be aware that carbon monoxide poisoning may be the cause of flu-like symptoms such as headaches, tightness of chest, dizziness, fatigue, confussion and breathing difficulties. Because carbon monoxide poisoning often causes a victim's blood pressure to rise, the victim's skin may take on a ink or red cast.\n4. Install a UL\/ULC Listed carbon monoxide detector outside sleeping areas. A UL\/ULC Listed carbon monoxide alarm will sound an alarm before dangerous levels of carbon monoxide accumulate.\nCarbon monoxide poisoning can happen to anyone, anytime, almost anywhere. While anyone is susceptible, experts agree that unborn babies, small children, senior citizens and people with heart or respiratory problems are especially vulnerable to carbon monoxide and are at the greatest risk for death or serious injuries. It\u00eds time to install your carbon monoxide detector.\nInfants and children are especially vulnerable to carbon monoxide due to their high metabolic rates. Because children use more oxygen faster than adults do, deadly carbon monoxide gas accumulates in their bodies faster and can interfere with oxygen supply to vital organs such as the brain and the heart. Unborn babies have an even higher risk of carbon monoxide poisoning and carbon monoxide poisoning in pregnant women has been linked to birth defects. This is another reason to install a carbon monoxide detector.\nHundreds of people die each year, and thousands more require medical treatment, because of carbon monoxide poisoning in their home. Now, with recent technological breakthroughs, you can avoid becoming one of these statistics simply by installing a carbon monoxide detector in your home.\nConsumers should consult their owner's maunal for a carbon monoxide detector procedure. However, the following is a general procedure:\nIf a carbon monoxide detector sounds a low level warning or hazard level alarm, consumers should push the test\/reset button to silence it.\nIf no one in the household has any carbon monoxide symptoms (headache, dizziness, nausea, and fatigue) consumers should be advised to open the doors and windows to air out their house. They should turn off any gas, oil or other fuel powered appliances including the furnace and call a qualified technician or thier local utility company to inspect and repair their home before restarting the furnace and all fuel-burning appliances.\nIf anyone in the household does have signs of carbon monoxide poisoning, consumers should leave their home immediately and call their local emergency service or 911 for help. They should do a head count to check that all persons are accounted for once outside in the fresh air. They should not re-enter their home until it has been aired out and the problem corrected by a qualified technician or utility company.\nMost carbon monoxide detectors sold at retail are for use in single residential living units only. They should only be used inside a single family home or apartment. They cannot be used in RV's or boats.\nCarbon monoxide detectors should not be installed in the following locations:\n1. Kitchens or within 5 feet of any cooking appliance where grease, smoke, and other decomposed compounds from cooking could build up on the surface of the carbon monoxide sensor and cause the alarm to malfunction.\n2. Bathrooms or the other rooms where long-term exposure to steam or high levels of water vapor could permanently damage the carbon monoxide sensor.\n3. Very cold (below 40 degrees Fahrenheit) or very hot (above 100 degrees Fahrenheit) rooms. The alarm will not work properly under these conditions.\n4. Do not place in a close proximity to an automobile exhaust pipe, as this will damage the sensor.\n***PLACE ONE CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTOR ON EVERY LEVEL OF YOUR HOME FOR MAXIMUM PROTECTION***\nRead the manufacturer's instructions carefully before installing a carbon monoxide alarm. Do not place the alarm within five feet of household chemicals. If your alarm is wired directly into your home's electrical system, you should test it monthly. If your unit operates off a battery, test the alarm weekly and replace the battery at least once a year.\nAvoid placing your alarm directly on top of or directly across from fuel-burning appliances. These appliances will emit some carbon monoxide when initially turned-on. Never use charcoal grills inside a home, tent, camper or unventilated garage. Don't leave vehichles running in an enclosed garage, even to 'warm up' your car on a cold morning.\nKnow how to respond to a carbon monoxide detector. If your alarm sounds, immediately open windows and doors for ventilation. if anyone in the home is experiencing symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning-headache, dizziness or other flu-like symptoms, immediately evacuate the house and call the fire department. Don't go back into the house until a fire fighter tells you it is okay to do so. If no one is experiencing these symptoms, continue to ventilate, turn off fuel-burning appliances and call a qualified technician to inspect your heating system and appliances as soon as possible. Because you have provided ventilation, the carbon monoxide buildup may have dissipated by the time help responds and your problem may appear to be temporarily solved. Do not operate any fuel-burning appliances until you have clearly identified the source of the problem. A carbon monoxide alarm indicates elevated levels of carbon monoxide in the home. NEVER IGNORE THE ALARM.\nThe safety experts urge consumers to recognize the danger signs of carbon monoxide before any harm can come to them or their families.","id":"<urn:uuid:a6654bd8-a96b-4e44-8f17-8171ec24a2b8>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.smokesign.com\/detectors.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9141326547,"token_count":4736,"score":3.328125,"int_score":3}
{"text":"DUE: MONDAY MAY 13, 2013\nAs we have discussed in class, Elijah is surrounded by an aura of mystery: we know nothing of his parentage; his tribe of origin and birthplace are unknown (though he is identified as a \u201cresident of Gilead\u201d); we are ignorant about his early life and call to prophecy; he travels widely, performs miracles, and of greatest importance, defies a conventional death, ascending to heaven in a fiery chariot instead.\nApproximately four centuries after Elijah\u2019s strange prophetic career came to a close, the prophet Malachi believed he would return to earth to fulfill another divine mission: \u201cBehold, I will send the prophet Elijah to you before the coming of the awesome, fearful day of the Lord. He shall reconcile parents with children, and children with their parents, so that, when I come, I do not strike the whole land with utter destruction\u201d (Malachi 3:23-24).\nLater on in rabbinic literature and folk legends, Elijah would take on a mythical role as the prophet who wanders the world generation after generation, protecting the weak and disadvantaged, humbling the arrogant who persecute the powerless. Capable of any disguise, he travels unrecognized through crowds of people, mysteriously appearing when needed and then just as mysteriously disappearing, revealing his identity on rare occasions only. It is fair to say that Elijah has captured the religious imagination of Jews as few other figures have.\nThe final project for 8th grade TaNaKh will focus on Elijah\u2019s larger-than-life role in Jewish literature and liturgy. Choose ONE of the following. Please note the final project is in lieu of a final exam, and will count significantly toward your grade \u2014 along with other factors like participation, conduct, effort and attendance. Here are your choices:\n1. Draw 3-4 pictures about Elijah, each telling a different story. You may wish to draw upon the biblical texts or folk stories we have studied (listed below) in creating your images. At least one of your pictures should place the prophet in a modern context. If Elijah came back today where would he go and whom would he visit? What would he look like? Each of your pictures should be accompanied by a paragraph or two explaining the setting and the reasons for depicting the prophet as you have.\n2. Create a folktale about Elijah. While drawing upon the biblical texts and folk stories we studied in class for inspiration, your literary effort should be creative, and not a simple retelling of a traditional story. I would encourage you to read Elie Wiesel\u2019s powerful short story, An Evening Guest (copies will be available from Cassie Vichozsky as of 4\/22, and will also be distributed at our next class), which places Elijah in a small Hungarian town in 1944 as a messenger sent to warn Jews about the Nazi death camps \u2014 it\u2019s a great example of taking the traditional picture of Elijah . . . and then turning it inside out in a very compelling way. Your folktale should be no shorter than 3 pages (typed, double-spaced, 12-font type).\n3. Research references to Elijah in the siddur and on religious occasions. At what ceremonies and celebrations do we invoke his name? Where in our liturgy does he appear? When and how did Elijah become connected with these particular rituals\/prayers? Why do we mention his name at these specific times\/places? Your research paper should be 4 pages at a minimum (typed, double-spaced, 12-font type).\n4. Elijah has also captured the religious imagination of Christians and Muslims. Research how Elijah is depicted in Christian and Muslim Scripture and compare\/contrast this with the ways in which Judaism describes his role. What are the similarities and differences in the Jewish understanding of the prophet Elijah and the way the other Abrahamic faiths view him? Your research paper should be 4 pages at a minimum (typed, double-spaced, 12-font type).\nWe have studied the following sources about Elijah:\nFirst Kings, chapters 17, 18 & 19; Second Kings, chapter 2; Folk stories about Elijah (handout distributed in class from Peninah Schram\u2019s Jewish Stories One Generation Tells Another).\nFirst Kings, chapter 21; Malachi, chapter 3; Elie Wiesel\u2019s short story, An Evening Guest (available from Cassie as of 4\/22).","id":"<urn:uuid:76a4d786-85f5-491d-b1a9-489169361ccd>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/mjgds.org\/classrooms\/lubliner\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9461318851,"token_count":920,"score":3.78125,"int_score":4}
{"text":"In the American electoral system, a primary election is an election that determines the nominee for each political party, who then competes for the office in the general election. A presidential primary is a state election that picks the delegates committed to nominate particular candidates for president of the United States. A presidential caucus, as in Iowa, requires voters to meet together for several hours in face-to-face meetings that select county delegates, who eventually pick the delegates to the national convention. No other country uses primaries; they choose their candidates in party conventions.\nPrimaries were introduced in the Progressive Era in the early 20th century to weaken the power of bosses and make the system more democratic. In presidential elections, they became important starting in 1952, when the first-in-the-nation New Hampshire Primary helped give Dwight D. Eisenhower the Republican nomination, and knocked Harry S. Truman out of the Democratic race because of his poor showing. In 1964, Lyndon B. Johnson ended his reelection campaign after doing poorly in New Hampshire.\nAfter 1968, both parties changed their rules to emphasize presidential primaries, although some states still use the caucus system.\nIn recent decades, New Hampshire holds the first primary a few days after Iowa holds the first caucus. That gives these two states enormous leverage, as the candidates and the media focus there. New Hampshire and Iowa receive about half of all the media attention given all primaries.\nThe primary allows voters to choose between different candidates of the some political parties, perhaps representing different wings of the party. For example, a Republican primary may choose between a range of candidates from moderate to conservative. Gallup's 2008 polling data indicated a trend in primary elections towards more conservative candidates, despite the more liberal result in the general election.\nIn recent years the primary seasons has come earlier and earlier, as states move up to earlier dates in the hope it will give them more leverage. For example, Barry Goldwater won the 1964 nomination because he won the last primary in California. The logic is faulty--in highly contested races the later primaries have more leverage. Thus in 2008 California gave up its traditional last-in-the-nation role and joined 20 other states on Super Tuesday. Neither the candidates not the voters paid it much attention. Michigan and Florida moved up their primaries in defiance of national Democratic Party rules and were penalized. The result is the primary season is extended, and is far more expensive, and no state gets an advantage--except for Iowa and New Hampshire, which now have dates in early January.\nIn late 2009 the two national parties are meeting to find a common solution.\n- Duncan, Dayton.

{"text":"Protecting your home against winter's 'silent killer'\n(BPT) - It\u2019s colorless, odorless and the No. 1 cause of accidental poisoning in the United States. And, it worsens in the winter.\nKnown as the \u201csilent killer,\u201d carbon monoxide (CO) is responsible for an average of 450 deaths and 20,000 emergency room visits each year, according to the Journal of the American Medical Association. With more than two-fifths of all CO poisonings occurring between December and February, homeowners are at increased risk once temperatures begin to drop.\n\u201cDuring the winter months, many families turn to heating sources they might not use at other times of the year,\u201d says Deborah Hanson, director of external affairs for First Alert, the most trusted name in home safety. \u201cWhile these heating sources may be effective at providing warmth, they also can pose great risks if not used properly. To help protect loved ones from the dangers of CO poisoning, it is important for homeowners to take proper precautions when dealing with any kind of fuel-burning heat source.\u201d\nFirst Alert recommends the following tips and tools for keeping your home and loved ones warm \u2013 and safe \u2013 this winter and all year long:\nProtect against CO poisoning\nRun kitchen vents or exhaust fans any time the stove is in use. The kitchen stove is among the most frequent sources of CO poisoning in the home. To help eliminate danger of overexposure, never use the oven to heat a home. Always run exhaust fans when cooking, especially during the holidays when stoves are left on for longer periods of time. Also, open a nearby window periodically when cooking to allow fresh air to circulate.\nNever use generators indoors. In the case of a power outage, portable electricity generators must be used outside only with power brought into the structure with a cord. Never use them inside the home, in a garage or in any confined area that can allow CO to collect. And be careful to follow operating instructions closely. Also refrain from using charcoal grills, camp stoves or other similar devices indoors.\nHave fuel-burning appliances inspected regularly. Arrange for a professional inspection of all fireplaces and fuel-burning appliances \u2013 such as furnaces, stoves, clothes dryers, water heaters and space heaters \u2013 annually to detect any CO leaks.\nBe mindful of the garage. Warming the car in the morning before work is common during the winter months, but running vehicles inside an attached garage, even if the door is open, is hazardous, as CO can leak into the home.\nInstall\/test CO alarms. Carbon monoxide alarms are the only way to detect this poisonous gas in a home. For maximum protection, alarms should be installed on every level of the home and near each sleeping area. Test alarm function monthly and change batteries every six months. In addition, alarms should be replaced every five to seven years to ensure proper function. If the installation date is unknown, replace immediately.\nFor more information on carbon monoxide safety, visit www.firstalert.com.","id":"<urn:uuid:69289004-835e-4965-a69a-a443f2b95705>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.kiowacountysignal.com\/section\/?template=araArchiveDetails&CategoryID=402&article=8070480101&archive=true","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9243112206,"token_count":633,"score":2.9375,"int_score":3}

{"text":"The Immune System\nBecause the human body provides an ideal environment for many microbes, they try to pass your skin barrier and enter. Your immune system is a bodywide network of cells, tissues, and organs that has evolved to defend you against such \"foreign\" invasions.The proper targets of your immune system are infectious organisms--bacteria such as these streptococci; fungi (this one happens to be Candida, the cause of yeast infections); parasites, including these worm-like microbes that cause malaria; and viruses such as this SARS virus.\nMarkers of Self\nAt the heart of the immune response is the ability to distinguish between \"self\" and \"non-self.\" Every cell in your body carries the same set of distinctive surface proteins that distinguish you as \"self.\" Normally your immune cells do not attack your own body tissues, which all carry the same pattern of self-markers; rather, your immune system coexists peaceably with your other body cells in a state known as self-tolerance.\nThis set of unique markers on human cells is called the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). There are two classes: MHC Class I proteins, which are on all cells, and MHC Class II proteins, which are only on certain specialized cells.\nMarkers of Non-Self\nAny non-self substance capable of triggering an immune response is known as an antigen. An antigen can be a whole non-self cell, a bacterium, a virus, an MHC marker protein or even a portion of a protein from a foreign organism.\nThe distinctive markers on antigens that trigger an immune response are called epitopes. When tissues or cells from another individual enter your body carrying such antigenic non-self epitopes, your immune cells react. This explains why transplanted tissues may be rejected as foreign and why antibodies will bind to them.\nMarkers of Self: Major Histocompatibility Complex\nYour immune cells recognize major histocompatibility complex proteins(MHC) when they distinguish between self and non-self. An MHC protein serves as a recognizable scaffold that presents pieces (peptides) of a foreign protein (antigenic) to immune cells.\nAn empty \"foreign\" MHC scaffold itself can act as an antigen when donor organs or cells are introduced into a patient's body. These MHC self-marker scaffolds are also known as a patient's \"tissue type\" or as human leukocyte antigens (HLA) when a patient's white blood cells are being characterized.\nFor example, when the immune system of a patient receiving a kidney transplant detects a non-self \"tissue type,\" the patient's body may rally its own immune cells to attack.\nEvery cell in your body is covered with these MHC self-marker proteins, and--except for identical twins--individuals carry different sets. MHC marker proteins are as distinct as blood types and come in two categories--MHC Class I: humans bear 6 markers out of 200 possible variations; and MHC Class II: humans display 8 out of about 230 possibilities.\nOrgans of the Immune System\nThe organs of your immune system are positioned throughout your body.\nThey are called lymphoid organs because they are home to lymphocytes--the white blood cells that are key operatives of the immune system. Within these organs, the lymphocytes grow, develop, and are deployed.\nBone marrow, the soft tissue in the hollow center of bones, is the ultimate source of all blood cells, including the immune cells.\nThe thymus is an organ that lies behind the breastbone; lymphocytes known as T lymphocytes, or just T cells, mature there.\nThe spleen is a flattened organ at the upper left of the abdomen. Like the lymph nodes, the spleen contains specialized compartments where immune cells gather and confront antigens.\nIn addition to these organs, clumps of lymphoid tissue are found in many parts of the body, especially in the linings of the digestive tract and the airways and lungs--gateways to the body. These tissues include the tonsils, adenoids, and appendix.\nThe organs of your immune system are connected with one another and with other organs of the body by a network of lymphatic vessels.\nLymphocytes can travel throughout the body using the blood vessels. The cells can also travel through a system of lymphatic vessels that closely parallels the body's veins and arteries. Cells and fluids are exchanged between blood and lymphatic vessels, enabling the lymphatic system to monitor the body for invading microbes. The lymphatic vessels carry lymph, a clear fluid that bathes the body's tissues.\nSmall, bean-shaped lymph nodes sit along the lymphatic vessels, with clusters in the neck, armpits, abdomen, and groin. Each lymph node contains specialized compartments where immune cells congregate and encounter antigens.\nImmune cells and foreign particles enter the lymph nodes via incoming lymphatic vessels or the lymph nodes' tiny blood vessels. All lymphocytes exit lymph nodes through outgoing lymphatic vessels. Once in the bloodstream, they are transported to tissues throughout the body. They patrol everywhere for foreign antigens, then gradually drift back into the lymphatic system to begin the cycle all over again.\nCells of the Immune System\nCells destined to become immune cells, like all blood cells, arise in your body's bone marrow from stem cells. Some develop into myeloid progenitor cells while others become lymphoid progenitor cells.\nThe myeloid progenitors develop into the cells that respond early and nonspecifically to infection. Neutrophils engulf bacteria upon contact and send out warning signals. Monocytes turn into macrophages in body tissues and gobble up foreign invaders. Granule-containing cells such as eosinophils attack parasites, while basophils release granules containing histamine and other allergy-related molecules.\nLymphoid precursors develop into the small white blood cells called lymphocytes. Lymphocytes respond later in infection. They mount a more specifically tailored attack after antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells (or macrophages) display their catch in the form of antigen fragments. The B cell turns into a plasma cell that produces and releases into the bloodstream thousands of specific antibodies. The T cells coordinate the entire immune response and eliminate the viruses hiding in infected cells.\nB cells work chiefly by secreting soluble substances known as antibodies. They mill around a lymph node, waiting for a macrophage to bring an antigen or for an invader such as a bacteria to arrive. When an antigen-specific antibody on a B cell matches up with an antigen, a remarkable transformation occurs.\nThe antigen binds to the antibody receptor, the B cell engulfs it, and, after a special helper T cell joins the action, the B cell becomes a large plasma cell factory that produces identical copies of specific antibody molecules at an astonishing pace--up to 10 million copies an hour.\nEach antibody is made up of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains, shaped to form a Y.\nThe sections that make up the tips of the Y's arms vary greatly from one antibody to another; this is called the variable region. It is these unique contours in the antigen-binding site that allow the antibody to recognize a matching antigen, much as a lock matches a key.\nThe stem of the Y links the antibody to other participants in the immune defenses. This area is identical in all antibodies of the same class--for instance, all IgEs--and is called the constant region.\nAntibodies belong to a family of large protein molecules known as immunoglobulins.\nScientists have identified nine chemically distinct classes of human immunoglobulins, four kinds of IgG and two kinds of IgA, plus IgM, IgE, and IgD.\nImmunoglobulins G, D, and E are similar in appearance. IgG, the major immunoglobulin in the blood, is also able to enter tissue spaces; it works efficiently to coat microorganisms, speeding their destruction by other cells in the immune system. IgD is almost exclusively found inserted into the membrane of B cells, where it somehow regulates the cell's activation. IgE is normally present in only trace amounts, but it is responsible for the symptoms of allergy.\nIgA--a doublet--guards the entrance to the body. It concentrates in body fluids such as tears, saliva, and secretions of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.\nIgM usually combines in star-shaped clusters. It tends to remain in the bloodstream, where it is very effective in killing bacteria.\nScientists long wondered how all the genetic information needed to make millions of different antibodies could fit in a limited number of genes.\nThe answer is that antibody genes are spliced together from widely scattered bits of DNA located in two different chromosomes. Each antibody molecule is made up of two separate chains, a heavy chain and a light chain. The heavy chain is where the binding of antigens occurs, so much genetic variation is involved in its assembly. For example, to form a heavy chain, 1 of 400 possible variable gene segments (V) combines with 1 out of 15 diversity segments (D) and 1 out of 4 joining (J) segments. This makes 24,000 possible combinations for the DNA encoding the heavy chain alone. As this part of the gene assembles, it joins the variable coding segments with those for the constant-C segments of the heavy-chain molecule.\nT cells contribute to your immune defenses in two major ways. Some help regulate the complex workings of the overall immune response, while others are cytotoxic and directly contact infected cells and destroy them.\nChief among the regulatory T cells are helper T cells. They are needed to activate many immune cells, including B cells and other T cells.\nCytotoxic T cells (sometimes called killer T cells) help rid your body of cells that have been infected by viruses as well as cells that have been transformed by cancer but have not yet adapted to evade the immune detection system. They are also responsible for the rejection of tissue and organ grafts.\nCytokines are diverse and potent chemical messengers secreted by the cells of your immune system. They are the chief communication signals of your T cells. Cytokines include interleukins, growth factors, and interferons.\nLymphocytes, including both T cells and B cells, secrete cytokines called lymphokines, while the cytokines of monocytes and macrophages are dubbed monokines. Many of these cytokines are also known as interleukins because they serve as a messenger between white cells, or leukocytes.\nInterferons are naturally occurring cytokines that may boost the immune system's ability to recognize cancer as a foreign invader.\nBinding to specific receptors on target cells, cytokines recruit many other cells and substances to the field of action. Cytokines encourage cell growth, promote cell activation, direct cellular traffic, and destroy target cells--including cancer cells.\nWhen cytokines attract specific cell types to an area, they are called chemokines. These are released at the site of injury or infection and call other immune cells to the region to help repair damage and defend against infection.\nKiller Cells: Cytotoxic Ts and NKs\nAt least two types of lymphocytes are killer cells--cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells. Both types contain granules filled with potent chemicals. Both types kill on contact. They bind their targets, aim their weapons, and deliver bursts of lethal chemicals.\nTo attack, cytotoxic T cells need to recognize a specific antigen bound to self-MHC markers, whereas natural killer (NK) cells will recognize and attack cells lacking these. This gives NK cells the potential to attack many types of foreign cells.\nPhagocytes and Their Relatives\nSome immune cells have more than one name. For example, the name \"phagocytes\" is given to the large immune cells that can engulf and digest foreign invaders, and the name \"granulocytes\" refers to immune cells that carry granules laden with killer chemicals.\nPhagocytes include monocytes, which circulate in the blood; macrophages, which are found in tissues throughout the body; dendritic cells, which are more stationary, monitoring their environment from one spot such as the skin; and neutrophils, cells that circulate in the blood but move into tissues when they are needed.\nMacrophages are versatile cells; besides acting as phagocytic scavengers, they secrete a wide variety of signaling cytokines (called monokines) that are vital to the immune response.\nNeutrophils are both phagocytes and granulocytes: they contain granules filled with potent chemicals. These chemicals, in addition to destroying microorganisms, play a key role in acute inflammatory reactions. Other types of granulocytes are eosinophils and basophils, which degranulate by spraying their chemicals onto harmful cells or microbes. The mast cell is a twin of the basophil, except it is not a blood cell. Rather, it is responsible for allergy symptoms in the lungs, skin, and linings of the nose and intestinal tract.\nA related structure, the blood platelet, is a cell fragment. Platelets, too, contain granules. They promote blood clotting and wound repair, and activate some immune defenses.\nPhagocytes in the Body\nIf foreign invaders succeed in getting past your skin barriers and manage to reach body tissues, they are usually recognized, ingested, and killed by phagocytes strategically positioned throughout the body. Macrophages and neutrophils are the main phagocytes involved, with macrophages as the first line of defense. Monocytes stop circulating in the blood and mature into specialized macrophages that migrate into the tissues of the body and prepare for invasion. Large numbers of mature macrophages reside in connective tissue, along the digestive tract, in the lungs, in the spleen, and even along certain blood vessels in the liver, where they are known as Kupffer cells.\nNeutrophils are short-lived immune cells that remain circulating in the blood. When tissue-based macrophages encounter an invader, neutrophils soon reinforce their immune response by coming to the site of infection in large numbers.\nThe complement system consists of a series of about 25 proteins that work to \"complement\" the work of antibodies in destroying bacteria. Complement also helps rid the body of antigen-antibody complexes. Complement proteins are the culprits that cause blood vessels to become dilated and leaky, causing redness and swelling during an inflammatory response.\nComplement proteins circulate in the blood in an inactive form. The so-called \"complement cascade\" is set off when the first complement molecule, C1, encounters antibody bound to antigen in an antigen-antibody complex. Each of the complement proteins performs its specialized job, acting, in turn, on the molecule next in line. The end product is a cylinder that punctures the cell membrane and, by allowing fluids and molecules to flow in and out, dooms the target cell.\nMounting an Immune Response\nMicrobes attempting to get into your body must first get past your skin and mucous membranes, which not only pose a physical barrier but are rich in scavenger cells and IgA antibodies.\nNext, they must elude a series of nonspecific defenses--and substances that attack all invaders regardless of the epitopes they carry. These include patrolling phagocytes, granulocytes, NK cells, and complement.\nInfectious agents that get past these nonspecific barriers must finally confront specific weapons tailored just for them. These include both antibodies and cytotoxic T cells.\nBoth B cells and T cells carry customized receptor molecules that allow them to recognize and respond to their specific targets.\nThe B cell's antigen-specific receptor that sits on its outer surface is also a sample of the antibody it is prepared to manufacture; this antibody-receptor recognizes antigen in its natural state.\nThe T cell's receptor systems are more complex. T cells can recognize an antigen only after the antigen is processed and presented in combination with a special type of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) marker. Killer T cells only recognize antigens in the grasp of Class I MHC markers, while helper T cells only recognize antigens in the grasp of Class II MHC markers. This complicated arrangement assures that T cells act only on precise targets and at close range.\nActivation of B Cells to Make Antibody\nThe B cell uses its antibody-receptor to bind a matching antigen, which it then engulfs and processes. This triggers the B cell to become a large plasma cell producing millions of copies of the same specific antibody. These antibodies then circulate in the bloodstream in search of more matching antigens. B cell antibodies cannot themselves kill an invading organism, but they can use their antibodies to mark invaders for destruction by other immune cells and by complement.\nActivation of T Cells: Helper\nHelper T cells only recognize antigen in the grasp of Class II MHC markers. An antigen-presenting cell--such as a macrophage or a dendritic cell--breaks down the antigen it devours, then it places small pieces (peptides) on its surface along with a Class II MHC marker. By exhibiting its catch in this way, antigen-presenting cells enable specific receptors on helper T cells to bind the antigen and confirm (via CD4 protein) that an invasion has occurred.\nAfter binding, a resting helper T cell quickly becomes an activated helper T. It assumes command of the immune response, giving orders to increase the number of specific antibody-producing plasma cells and the cytotoxic killer cells needed to quell the attack.\nActivation of T Cells: Cytotoxic\nKiller T cells only recognize antigen in the grasp of Class I MHC markers. Here a resting cytotoxic T cell recognizes virus fragments, which are displayed by a macrophage in combination with a Class I MHC marker. A receptor on a circulating, resting cytotoxic T cell (and CD8 protein) recognizes the antigen-protein complex and binds to it. The binding process and an activated helper T cell activate the cytotoxic T cell. Because the surfaces of other infected cells bear the same virus fragments in combination with Class I MHC markers, the activated cytotoxic T cells can quickly recognize, attack, and destroy the diseased cell.\nRegulatory T Cells\nYour immune system also has a braking mechanism, a checkpoint to prevent immune responses to self. Without this checkpoint, autoimmune disease could flourish. An additional type of immune cells--regulatory T cells--are these critical braking agents.\nResearchers don't yet know exactly how regulatory T cells operate. Some think these T cells recognize and compete for the same antigens as those that activate helper and cytotoxic T cells, but that regulatory T cells zero in on a different epitope. Another possibility is that cytotoxic or helper T cells only multiply when regulatory T cells are absent.\nRegulatory T cells have become important to researchers who are trying to increase the efficacy of vaccines for cancer and AIDS. In addition to increasing the antigenicity of the immunizing element, a better understanding of regulatory T cells will permit scientists to reduce the immune system's brake activity, which often limits the effectiveness of vaccines.\nImmunity: Active and Passive\nWhenever T cells and B cells are activated, some become \"memory\" cells. The next time that an individual encounters that same antigen, the immune system is primed to destroy it quickly. This is active immunity because the body's immune system prepares itself for future challenges. Long-term active immunity can be naturally acquired by infection or artificially acquired by vaccines made from infectious agents that have been inactivated or, more commonly, from minute portions of the microbe.\nShort-term passive immunity can be transferred artificially from one individual to another via antibody-rich serum; similarly, a mother enables an infant to naturally acquire protection while growing within her by donating her antibodies and certain immune cells. This is passive immunity because the infant who is protected does not produce antibodies, but borrows them.\nDisorders of the Immune System: Allergy\nWhen your immune system malfunctions, it can unleash a torrent of disorders and diseases.\nOne of the most familiar is allergy. Allergies such as hay fever and hives are related to the antibody known as IgE. The first time an allergy-prone person is exposed to an allergen--for instance, grass pollen--the individual's B cells make large amounts of grass pollen IgE antibody. These IgE molecules attach to granule-containing cells known as mast cells, which are plentiful in the lungs, skin, tongue, and linings of the nose and gastrointestinal tract. The next time that person encounters grass pollen, the IgE-primed mast cell releases powerful chemicals that cause the wheezing, sneezing, and other symptoms of allergy.\nDisorders of the Immune System: Autoimmune Disease\nSometimes the immune system's recognition apparatus breaks down, and the body begins to manufacture antibodies and T cells directed against the body's own cells and organs.\nSuch cells and autoantibodies, as they are known, contribute to many diseases. For instance, T cells that attack pancreas cells contribute to diabetes, while an autoantibody known as rheumatoid factor is common in persons with rheumatoid arthritis.\nDisorders of the Immune System: Immune Complex Disease\nImmune complexes are clusters of interlocking antigens and antibodies.\nNormally they are rapidly removed from the bloodstream. In some circumstances, however, they continue to circulate, and eventually they become trapped in, and damage, the tissues of the kidneys, as seen here, or the lungs, skin, joints, or blood vessels.\nDisorders of the Immune System: AIDS\nWhen the immune system is lacking one or more of its components, the result is an immunodeficiency disorder.\nThese disorders can be inherited, acquired through infection, or produced as an inadvertent side effect of drugs such as those used to treat cancer or transplant patients.\nAIDS is an immunodeficiency disorder caused by a virus that destroys helper T cells. The virus copies itself incessantly and invades helper T cells and macrophages, the very cells needed to organize an immune defense. The AIDS virus splices its DNA into the DNA of the cell it infects; the cell is thereafter directed to churn out new viruses.\nHuman Tissue Typing for Transplants\nAlthough MHC proteins are required for T cell responses against foreign invaders, they can pose difficulty during transplantation. Every cell in the body is covered with MHC self-markers, and each person bears a slightly unique set. If a T lymphocyte recognizes a non-self MHC scaffold, it will rally immune cells to destroy the cell that bears it. For successful organ or blood stem cell transplantations, doctors must pair organ recipients with donors whose MHC sets match as closely as possible. Otherwise, the recipient's T cells will likely attack the transplant, leading to graft rejection.\nTo find good matches, tissue typing is usually done on white blood cells, or leukocytes. In this case, the MHC-self-markers are called human leukocyte antigens, or HLA. Each cell has a double set of six major HLA markers, HLA-A, B, and C, and three types of HLA-D. Since each of these antigens exists, in different individuals, in as many as 20 varieties, the number of possible HLA types is about 10,000. The genes that encode the HLA antigens are located on chromosome 6.\nA child in the womb carries foreign antigens from the father as well as immunologically compatible self-antigens from the mother.\nOne might expect this condition to trigger a graft rejection, but it does not because the uterus is an \"immunologically privileged\" site where immune responses are somehow subdued.\nImmunity and Cancer\nWhen normal cells turn into cancer cells, some of the antigens on their surface change. These cells, like many body cells, constantly shed bits of protein from their surface into the circulatory system. Often, tumor antigens are among the shed proteins.\nThese shed antigens prompt action from immune defenders, including cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells, and macrophages. According to one theory, patrolling cells of the immune system provide continuous bodywide surveillance, catching and eliminating cells that undergo malignant transformation. Tumors develop when this immune surveillance breaks down or is overwhelmed.\nA new approach to cancer therapy uses antibodies that have been specially made to recognize specific cancers.\nWhen coupled with natural toxins, drugs, or radioactive substances, the antibodies seek out their target cancer cells and deliver their lethal load. Alternatively, toxins can be linked to a lymphokine and routed to cells equipped with receptors for the lymphokine.\nDendritic Cells That Attack Cancer\nAnother approach to cancer therapy takes advantage of the normal role of the dendritic cell as an immune educator. Dendritic cells grab antigens from viruses, bacteria, or other organisms and wave them at T cells to recruit their help in an initial T cell immune response. This works well against foreign cells that enter the body, but cancer cells often evade the self\/non-self detection system. By modifying dendritic cells, researchers are able to trigger a special kind of autoimmune response that includes a T cell attack of the cancer cells. Because a cancer antigen alone is not enough to rally the immune troops, scientists first fuse a cytokine to a tumor antigen with the hope that this will send a strong antigenic signal. Next, they grow a patient's dendritic cells in the incubator and let them take up this fused cytokine-tumor antigen. This enables the dendritic cells to mature and eventually display the same tumor antigens as appear on the patient's cancer cells. When these special mature dendritic cells are given back to the patient, they wave their newly acquired tumor antigens at the patient's immune system, and those T cells that can respond mount an attack on the patient's cancer cells.\nThe Immune System and the Nervous System\nBiological links between the immune system and the central nervous system exist at several levels.\nHormones and other chemicals such as neuropeptides, which convey messages among nerve cells, have been found also to \"speak\" to cells of the immune system--and some immune cells even manufacture typical neuropeptides. In addition, networks of nerve fibers have been found to connect directly to the lymphoid organs.\nThe picture that is emerging is of closely interlocked systems facilitating a two-way flow of information. Immune cells, it has been suggested, may function in a sensory capacity, detecting the arrival of foreign invaders and relaying chemical signals to alert the brain. The brain, for its part, may send signals that guide the traffic of cells through the lymphoid organs.\nA hybridoma is a hybrid cell produced by injecting a specific antigen into a mouse, collecting an antibody-producing cell from the mouse's spleen, and fusing it with a long-lived cancerous immune cell called a myeloma cell. Individual hybridoma cells are cloned and tested to find those that produce the desired antibody. Their many identical daughter clones will secrete, over a long period of time, millions of identical copies of made-to-order \"monoclonal\" antibodies.\nThanks to hybridoma technology, scientists are now able to make large quantities of specific antibodies.\nGenetic engineering allows scientists to pluck genes--segments of DNA--from one type of organism and to combine them with genes of a second organism.\nIn this way, relatively simple organisms such as bacteria or yeast can be induced to make quantities of human proteins, including interferons and interleukins. They can also manufacture proteins from infectious agents, such as the hepatitis virus or the AIDS virus, for use in vaccines.\nThe SCID-hu Mouse\nThe SCID mouse, which lacks a functioning immune system of its own, is helpless to fight infection or reject transplanted tissue.\nBy transplanting immature human immune tissues and\/or immune cells into these mice, scientists have created an in vivo model that promises to be of immense value in advancing our understanding of the immune system.","id":"<urn:uuid:db18851c-6b7c-43c0-9376-9df436e862d0>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.cancer.gov\/cancertopics\/understandingcancer\/immunesystem\/page10\/AllPages\/Print","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9323487878,"token_count":5948,"score":3.90625,"int_score":4}
{"text":"\"Helplessness\" and \"confusion\" are words that easily come to mind when the issue of sick building syndrome is mentioned. It is a problem that does not have a regulatory solution, and is bound with engineering, medicine and emotions that will challenge the best of school administrators.\nA careful management style and knowledgeable use of technologies in medicine, toxicology and property maintenance are a school administrator's best allies in preparing to deal with or prevent this new generation of health and safety challenges.\nDefining sick building syndrome There is no regulatory definition for sick building syndrome. Although it often relates to indoor-air-quality problems, it simply means that the environment of a building is inspiring complaints of discomfort and\/or disease.\nFundamentally, the causes of sick buildings relate to architecture and engineering patterns institutionalized in school construction following World War II. Schools of glass, rock and wood, with high ceilings, cross-ventilation via a transom over the door, and windows and radiators that could be adjusted by teachers no longer were built. These schools were being replaced with new, factory-like buildings featuring a temperamental, eccentric system of master controls for indoor environment. Buildings were constructed with no regard to the environment around them or to people within the property. Today, allowing for the ambiguity in defining sick buildings, somewhere between 1-in-5 and 1-in-15 school facilities are in a situation where discomfort and disease can be attributed to operations of the building.\nHealth symptoms in a sick building are highly variable, but generally split into three categories:\n-Radical reaction--a number of people clearly and suddenly ill. This usually involves limited air exchange combined with a \"smoking gun,\" which can include a new chemical cleaner, misbatched chlorine in a pool area, a weather inversion preventing a kiln from venting properly or a failure of a mechanical air-exchange system.\n-Unhealthy atmosphere--many people experiencing ongoing subtle illness or discomfort. The most common symptoms involve the dehydration of sensitive tissue, including sore eyes, throat or nasal membranes; a feeling of lethargy; a higher incidence of upper-respiratory infection; asthmatic reactions; low-grade headaches; and a continuum of muscle pain and general discomfort among building occupants. Much of this relates to oxygen deprivation typically caused by oxygen being displaced by other compounds, and occasionally by infestation of microbes as a result of excessive moisture remaining within the property.\n-Hypersensitive reaction or multiple chemical sensitivity reaction--one or two individuals extremely ill. This can result if even tiny exposures occur to anyone that has a highly sensitive reaction to certain chemicals. Typically, these complaints should be viewed as warnings that some low-level toxin is in the area.\nAlthough sick building syndrome usually relates to the general nature of the building itself, there are some specifics that account for most indoor-air problems:\n*Combustibles; any possible introduction of carbon monoxide. *Moisture as it may relate to mold (look for growths on drywall). *Moisture as it may relate to airborne infectious agents (standing water and consequent growths). *Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), usually cleaning agents or building materials, which may give off unpleasant, sometimes toxic gases. *Formaldehydes in new carpet, pressed wood or other building products. *Any new or newly exposed particleboard. *Applied poisons (pesticides, insecticides, rodenticides, herbicides).\nA proactive approach Administrators are dealing with a generation of post-World War II properties prone to indoor-air-quality problems, particularly buildings constructed or remodeled during the 1970s energy crisis. A school district should take several steps before a problem strikes. First, initiate patterns for preventing air-quality problems. Second, establish baseline information that will profile the building to facilitate an efficient, inexpensive and confidence-inspiring response. Building occupants and the community need to see a clear and confident administrative approach should a problem arise in the future.\nThe proactive investigation of the building should involve a limited amount of basic testing, particularly a professional review of the microbial matrix within the building--the number of colony-forming units or what kinds of microbes presently are nesting in the building. Understanding what is living in the ambient air can help administrators understand if there is a problem or, more importantly, can help to quickly isolate the exact nature of a problem.\nSimilarly, administrators should consider hiring an outside contractor to review how air-handling and mechanical-engineering systems are managed. A knowledgeable person should walk the area and observe the mechanical systems to see how the filtering system, the air-dispersion system and the air-dilution patterns of the building are operating. Finally, a reliable epidemiological profile of comparative absenteeism should be archived.\nAdministrators also need to be ready to implement a smooth, confidence-building reporting system for occupants regarding air-quality or sick-building concerns. How fast and capably the district responds can be the key to getting the issue under control. The costs for responding to indoor-air problems decrease dramatically if there is baseline data and a plan in place.","id":"<urn:uuid:f673350f-8b06-4580-b54b-a3217aacfede>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/asumag.com\/mag\/university_prescribing_cure","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9389723539,"token_count":1048,"score":3.40625,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Here's a fine think-piece by Susan Cain that praises some introversion as indispensable for creativity. To some great extent, Socrates and Jesus were solitary men. And the wisdom they shared with us couldn't have been captured in group reports or multi-authored articles.\nNot only that, we live in a society that discourages, in so many ways, thinking for ourselves. We defer so readily to public opinion, fashion, and what the experts say and the studies show. Most studies that show stuff have a lot more than one author. Most books that change our lives have only one, and we don't live in a time when many are being written.\nJust about every good play or novel or painting, of course, has its source in the vision of a single artist.\nWe also see, of course, that in the disciplines that require deep thought and personal interpretation (such as philosophy\u2014especially political philosophy\u2014and history), articles almost only have one author. Technical and scientific reports usually have more authors than they do pages.\nIf we want learning to be personal, personal thought has to be encouraged and rewarded. And persons, of course, have to be held personally responsible for both what they've learned and the ways in which they have expressed their thoughts.\nIn a class dealing with \"real books\" (such as ones written by Plato or Kant or Jane Austen or Pascal or Simone Weil), I find that the best students get less than ten percent of what's really going on, and \"what's gotten\" differs dramatically from student to student. If they had to produce a multi-authored paper, the result would be flattened out to what they can explain to each other. It goes without saying the good students would be particularly shy about expressing their most unconventional thoughts to each other, especially ones that have to do with God, love, death, and such to the other group members. They would also be shy about being too enthusiastic or \"erotic\" about what they've read to others who just didn't work as hard or care as much as they did. (All this is why I can't stand \"peer review\" as even a stage in evaluating student papers.)\nIt also goes without saying that the natural result is for good students to have quite different views on the truth and significance of what they've read\u2014in part, due to what else they've read and their personal experiences. How could they possibly write a conclusion based on some consensus that's more than a bunch of feel-good banalities?\nGood students do, of course, learn from each other through conversation. Part of a great class is something like a Socratic dialogue\u2014keeping in mind that the participant closest to Socrates (me) dominates the discussion in various ways. The community of learners doesn't mean that all the learners are equal in the ways relevant to actual learning.\nIn the end: The student paper should be a rather solitary, introverted effort, although not one so introverted that the author is not excited about the possibility that the truth can be shared in common. \"Shared in common\" in the Socratic sense is a long distance from groupthink or what's usually meant by collaborative learning.\nAnother problem with \"group projects\" as a learning tool is that our society already rewards being witty and fashionable and pleasing to others far too much. It also already rewards too much shirkers whose main talent is taking credit for the real work of others. Let sucking up be saved for the actual world of business. It's not a skill that should be rewarded by college credit.\nHere's another problem: Collaborative learning is also often an excuse for professorial laziness. Why read twenty papers when you can read five (written by groups of four)? The group dynamic also means that the papers will only be so good or so bad, and that means that the professor won't be taxed by a product that is too \"outside the box\" of what's expected.\nIf you ever sign up for a class that's a mixture of PowerPoint presentations based on some textbook followed up by group projects and presentations, immediately drop it and ask for your money back.\nThe philosopher Rousseau was against taking the idea of dispersing wisdom to everyone characteristic of the Enlightenment too seriously because the real goal of that approach is the production of a vain and pseudo-sophisticated herd of seemingly meritocratic techno-elitists.

{"text":"How to do just that particularly in the Virgin Islands was on display Tuesday at Good Hope School as the St. Croix Environmental Association sponsored its second Environmental Science Career Expo in partnership with the V.I. Network of Environmental Educators.\nThe goal of the event was to enable middle school and high school students to learn about the career path choices, work experience and skills required to attain jobs in science and technological fields with representatives from private enterprises, government and nonprofit agencies participated.\n\u201cWe want to get kids excited about science. We live on a small piece of land and are surrounded by the ocean and we have to take care of it,\u201d said St. Croix Environmental Association spokeswoman Lynnea Roberts.\n\u201cBeyond that, we want kids to be excited about college and going to study science,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a lot of science going on around the island that is sort of undercover and a lot of people don\u2019t know about it.\u201d\nRoberts said she hopes to put on two more of these career fairs later this year at both Central and Complex High Schools.\nMarcia Taylor of the University of the Virgin Islands\u2019 Center for Marine and Environmental Studies said she was there to recruit the future.\n\u201cWe want more young people going into careers related to the marine environment,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWe want to get more local students trained so they can take the jobs here in their home.\u201d\n\u201cThere are a lot of opportunities down here and it would be great if people that lived here could benefit from that,\u201d Taylor said.\nShe said graduates of the program, if they\u2019ve wanted to stay and work in the territory, have had success in finding careers here.\nShe also noted the same marine issues Roberts mentioned \u2014 overfishing and ocean acidification. She said future job prospects in these fields would be plentiful for those interested in learning how to manage those problems and mitigate the effects of them, especially as they pertain to the V.I. coral reef systems.\n\u201cThere are more federal dollars being spent down here because we realize we\u2019re on the brink of losing an incredible resource. There\u2019s more grants related to that, more people studying it and that\u2019s an area where there\u2019s more money being pumped in all the time.\u201d\nAs students wandered from booth to booth learning about the work of those participating organizations, some teachers were even collaborating with agency representatives in the hopes of doing hands on work inside the classroom at a later date.\nLeila Muller of the V.I. Energy Office and teacher Sarah Christiansen of AZ Academy were just one example as they were planning renewable energy demonstrations for Christiansen\u2019s fifth- and eighth-grade science students.\n\u201cThis is the future, right here,\u201d Christiansen said, pointing at some solar energy demonstrations. \u201cKids need to know what the future is going to be like and need to prepare for the future and what types of jobs and careers will be available.\u201d\nMuller said, \u201cWe\u2019re also going to be doing more sustainable buildings and green buildings,\u201d adding that\u2019s where the future is. \u201cAnd we want the young minds to know what opportunities there are in the field of energy.\u201d\nAZ Academy sophomores Conrad Yanez and Rick Beggs said they came away from the event with more environmental knowledge of how to protect St. Croix and with a possible goal to attain in the future.\n\u201cI might be interested in the science part of it,\u201d Beggs said. \u201cMaybe one day I\u2019ll come up with a new way to protect corals.\u201d\n\u201cI think I might be a marine biologist, maybe mangroves or something like that,\u201d Yanez added. \u201cI like working in places like Salt River.

{"text":"Become a fan of h2g2\nDaniel Boone, a legendary American frontiersman, was once quoted as saying, 'I ain't never been lost, but I may have been confused once or twice'. With all respect to Mr Boone - who was born in Pennsylvania, incidentally - it's incredibly easy to get lost and confused in the forests and mountains of Pennsylvania.\nIn the course of the state's 300-plus year recorded history, many people have gotten lost and confused. And they've lost plenty of things while stumbling around in the Pennsylvania woodlands - including a surprising amount of gold and silver.\nLate in the 1690s, a group of French Canadians, led by Louis Frontenac, departed New Orleans and headed towards Montreal. They sailed up the Mississippi River to the Ohio River turn-off. They then went up the Ohio to the location of present-day Pittsburgh and took the left fork up the Allegheny River. On their rafts were kegs filled with gold coins destined for the Royal Governor of Canada's treasury.\nUpon reaching present-day Potter County, Pennsylvania, they started overland, but the heavy kegs of coins made the going slow. Fearing an English or Indian attack, they decided to bury the treasure just north of the location of present-day Coudersport.\nThey marked their cache of gold with a cross chipped onto a rock. Seneca Indians are said to have seen the cross on the rock, but left it alone because they feared the site had special mystical significance. In time, the marker wore off the stone and the Indians were unable to remember where it was located.\nThe Frenchmen never returned for their gold and to this day it has never been found.\nThe Counterfeiter's Gold\nThen there's the story of Cyrus Cole who, in the early 1900s, lived by himself in a shack near the swamps outside Eldred in McKean County, Pennsylvania. Cole was something of a bum, surviving by picking berries and trapping muskrats yet, strangely, he was never short of cash.\nThe United States Secret Service had agents investigating an influx of counterfeit silver half dollars and gold coins in the area, but could never get any leads. Then in 1912, they got an anonymous tip that Cole was the mastermind behind the counterfeiting ring. Armed with a search warrant, the agents searched Cole's shack and found some evidence, but not enough for a conviction.\nThey searched the swamp for evidence of the minting equipment, but came up empty-handed. Legend has it that Cole buried his counterfeit coins and his real gold and silver profits somewhere on the high ground near Eldred. None of it has ever been recovered.\nCivil War Gold\nIn 1863, during the American Civil War1, a Union Army lieutenant was ordered to escort a wagon that had been fitted with a false base. This disguised compartment contained 26 gold bars each weighing 50 pounds. The wagon was to travel from Wheeling, West Virginia, north through Pennsylvania and then south to Washington, DC - the idea behind this route was to avoid any possible encounter with Confederate forces.\nIn the early stages of the journey, the lieutenant was sick with fever. During a fit of delirium, he blurted out the fact that the wagon contained a fortune in gold. After his fever broke, the expedition left St Marys, Pennsylvania, heading for Driftwood where they were to build a raft and float down the Susquehanna River to Harrisburg. They never made it, vanishing somewhere in the forests of Cameron and Elk counties.\nTwo months later, the party's civilian guide stumbled into Lock Haven - 50 miles east of St Marys, the last known location of the convoy. Army investigators interrogated the guide for days and heard that bandits ambushed the group, killing all the soldiers and taking the gold. The Army did not believe this story.\nPinkerton2 detectives were hired to search the area, but all they found were some dead mules in the area of Dent's Run near present-day Route 55 in Elk County. In the early 1870s, human skeletons which were believed to be those of the soldiers were found in the same area.\nThe guide was drafted into the army and assigned to a fort in the west. A heavy drinker, when he was drunk he would claim to know where the gold was hidden. But when he sobered up, he disavowed all knowledge of the treasure's location.\nLocal rumour has it that during the past 50 years the modern US Army has sent several teams into the area around Dent's Run searching for the gold. Despite these alleged ongoing searches, the gold has never been recovered.\nDuring the American Civil War, Confederate raiders captured a Union convoy heading from West Virginia to the Philadelphia Mint. The convoy's treasure - some 15 tons of silver bars - was stolen and hidden inside a cave north of Uniontown, Pennsylvania. The rebels sealed the mouth of the cave and never returned for the booty. Some say it's still out there waiting to be discovered.\nIn 1680, a Spanish treasure ship sank off the Bahamas. A hundred and thirty years later a British captain named 'Blackbeard'3 found the treasure and recovered several tons of silver.\nBlackbeard sailed into Baltimore harbour intending to transfer the silver to a British warship for transport to London. Fearing that the ship would be followed and attacked on the high seas, Blackbeard sent the silver overland by wagon to Canada where it would be loaded into a convoy of strong ships.\nBy the time Blackbeard reached Renovo, Pennsylvania, the War of 18124 had begun and Blackbeard, fearing that the silver would fall into USA hands, buried the treasure in the mountains outside Emporium in McKean County near present-day Route 155. Blackbeard never returned for the silver and rumour has it that it is still there today.\nRobber Lewis' Lost Booty\nDavid 'Robber' Lewis made a reputation for himself in the early 1800s, robbing the rich and giving to the poor. He was captured in 1820 and on his deathbed, he confessed to all his crimes and told his jailers of three caches of gold he had hidden in Pennsylvania:\nOne, containing $10,000 in gold, is said to have been hidden in a small cave along the Juniata River near Lewistown, Pennsylvania. Lewis returned for the cache and couldn't find it because the river had flooded and washed away his trail markers.\nA second cache is purported to be buried along the Conodoguinett Creek near the caves he used as a hide-out.\nThe third, reportedly containing $20,000, is buried in the hills outside of Bellefonte. During his last imprisonment, Lewis is said to have taunted his jailers by telling them that he could see the cache from the jail.\nNone of these caches have ever been recovered.\nCash at Kinzua\nIn the 1890s, a man robbed a bank in Emporium, Pennsylvania, making off with $40,000 in cash. Apparently, he got lost and wound up in the village of Hazel Hurst where he collapsed. Not having a good day, our man died of 'exhaustion' a short time later, but not before confessing that he had buried the loot north-east of Kushequa within sight of the Kinzua railroad bridge. The money has never been recovered.\nThe Belsano Train Robbery\nOn 11 October, 1924, a train carrying a safe containing a payroll of $33,000 was robbed just outside the Cambria County, Pennsylvania town of Belsano. During the course of the robbery, one of the men who was guarding the safe was shot and killed.\nPolice in several neighbouring states joined the manhunt for Michelo Bassi and Anthony Pezzi and the murderous duo were apprehended two weeks after the robbery in Terre Haute, Indiana. Each had a gun and $3,000 in cash. The men were convicted of first degree murder and in February 1925, they were executed in the state's electric chair.\nThe safe and some of the money was never recovered. Legend has it that it may be buried or hidden near the site of the robbery.\nThe Lost Cave of Silver\nSomewhere in the Allegheny National Forest to the west of the town of Tionesta, Pennsylvania is a cave reputed to be full of silver.\nDuring the late 1700s, a white settler named Hill got lost and sought shelter in a cave for the night. Inside the cave he saw veins of silver running everywhere through the walls and ceiling. In the floor was a great pit filled with pure silver. When he managed to find his way home, he was unable to find his way back to the cave.\nHill's story was backed up by an early entrepreneur who traded liquor with the indigenous Indians in exchange for furs and silver. When he asked them where they got all their silver, legend has it that they blindfolded him and took him to a cave matching the one described in Hill's story.\nPure silver was found in Indian burial grounds near Irvine, Warren County - approximately 15 miles upstream from Tionesta. However, the Cave of Silver has never been found.\nOther Lost Treasures\nAn aeroplane carrying a quarter-million dollars in cash crashed near Mount Carmel in 1948. The money was thrown out of the plane just prior to the crash and was never found.\nBandit Michael Rizzalo stole a $12,000 payroll in 1888. He was said to have buried it in a tin box somewhere on Laurel Run Mountain, just outside the town of Wilkes-Bare. The money is supposed to still be there today.\nIn 1775, a gang of Tories5 hid $100,000 in gold coins in the Wernersville area. The loot was never recovered.\nA Handy Tip\nWhen visiting Pennsylvania, don't forget to pack your metal detector.","id":"<urn:uuid:6602e84a-9863-4902-8c33-f6dd2cfd08c1>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.h2g2.com\/approved_entry\/A536573","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9794114232,"token_count":2052,"score":2.671875,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Excerpt of How To Read And Why by Harold Bloom\n(Page 2 of 5)\nPrinter Friendly Excerpt\nI turn to reading as a solitary praxis, rather than as an educational enterprise. The way we read now, when we are alone with ourselves, retains considerable continuity with the past, however it is performed in the academies. My ideal reader (and lifelong hero) is Dr. Samuel Johnson, who knew and expressed both the power and the limitation of incessant reading. Like every other activity of the mind, it must satisfy Johnson's prime concern, which is with \"what comes near to ourself, what we can put to use.\" Sir Francis Bacon, who provided some of the ideas that Johnson put to use, famously gave the advice: \"Read not to contradict and confute, nor to believe and take for granted, nor to find talk and discourse, but to weigh and consider.\" I add to Bacon and Johnson a third sage of reading, Emerson, fierce enemy of history and of all historicisms, who remarked that the best books \"impress us with the conviction, that one nature wrote and the same reads.\" Let me fuse Bacon, Johnson, and Emerson into a formula of how to read: find what comes near to you that can be put to the use of weighing and considering, and that addresses you as though you share the one nature, free of time's tyranny. Pragmatically that means, first find Shakespeare, and let him find you. If King Lear is fully to find you, then weigh and consider the nature it shares with you; its closeness to yourself. I do not intend this as an idealism, but as a pragmatism. Putting the tragedy to use as a complaint against patriarchy is to forsake your own prime interests, particularly as a young woman, which sounds rather more ironical than it is. Shakespeare, more than Sophocles, is the inescapable authority upon intergenerational conflict, and more than anyone else, upon the differences between women and men. Be open to a full reading of King Lear, and you will understand better the origins of what you judge to be patriarchy.\nUltimately we read -- as Bacon, Johnson, and Emerson agree -- in order to strengthen the self, and to learn its authentic interests. We experience such augmentations as pleasure, which may be why aesthetic values have always been deprecated by social moralists, from Plato through our current campus Puritans. The pleasures of reading indeed are selfish rather than social. You cannot directly improve anyone else's life by reading better or more deeply. I remain skeptical of the traditional social hope that care for others may be stimulated by the growth of individual imagination, and I am wary of any arguments whatsoever that connect the pleasures of solitary reading to the public good.\nThe sorrow of professional reading is that you recapture only rarely the pleasure of reading you knew in youth, when books were a Hazlittian gusto. The way we read now partly depends upon our distance, inner or outer, from the universities, where reading is scarcely taught as a pleasure, in any of the deeper senses of the aesthetics of pleasure. Opening yourself to a direct confrontation with Shakespeare at his strongest, as in King Lear, is never an easy pleasure, whether in youth or in age, and yet not to read King Lear fully (which means without ideological expectations) is to be cognitively as well as aesthetically defrauded. A childhood largely spent watching television yields to an adolescence with a computer, and the university receives a student unlikely to welcome the suggestion that we must endure our going hence even as our going hither: ripeness is all. Reading falls apart, and much of the self scatters with it. All this is past lamenting, and will not be remedied by any vows or programs. What is to be done can only be performed by some version of elitism, and that is now unacceptable, for reasons both good and bad. There are still solitary readers, young and old, everywhere, even in the universities. If there is a function of criticism at the present time, it must be to address itself to the solitary reader, who reads for herself, and not for the interests that supposedly transcend the self.\nCopyright \u00a9 2000 by Harold Bloom.

{"text":"The Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra, or Movement of the\nLandless Rural Workers (the MST), was formally created at the Primeiro Encontro\nde Trabalhadores Sem Terra [First Meeting of Landless Workers], which took\nplace from January 21-24, 1984, in Cascavel, in the State of Paran\u00e1,\nin the south of Brazil. Today, the MST is organized in 22 states and pursues\nthe same objectives defined at this 1984 Meeting and ratified at the First\nNational Conference at Curitiba, Paran\u00e1, in 1985: to fight for land,\nfor agrarian reform, and for the building of a just society, without exploiters\nand exploited. Since its creation, the MST has included in its political agenda\nthe fight for schools and the discussion on what kind of school should be a\npart of the life of the Sem Terra family.\nThis article discusses the pedagogical lessons that we can learn from the historical\nexperience of the MST. Before introducing some of these, however, it is important\nto situate the context that allows us to think of a social movement of farm\nworkers as a place that may have lessons to offer on the processes of human\nThe MST came into its seventeenth year of existence reflecting deeply on two\nof the great tasks that were defined throughout its history: first, to help\nput an end to the \"mortal sin\" of the latifundium, decentralizing the\nlands of this immense country, Brazil, and making them socially productive;\nand second, to help humanize people, to develop human beings with dignity, identity,\nand a project for the future. This second task, perhaps the one that the MST\nhas accomplished best since its undertaking, is what causes us to think more\ndirectly of the educational dimension of the Movement.\nThe educational work of the MST has three main dimensions: first, the recovery\nof the dignity of thousands of families who once again have roots and purpose.\nThe poor in everything have become citizens: people with rights, people who\nwork, study, produce, are a part of their communities, and who, in their daily\nchallenges, set a new agenda of discussion for this country. The second dimension\nis the building of a collective identity, one which goes beyond each person,\nfamily, and settlement. The identity of the Sem Terra [Landless],\nand the capital letters without a hyphen, like a proper name that identifies\nthose who are no longer individuals who lack something have no land (land-less)\nbut are individuals with a choice that of fighting for more social justice and\ndignity for all. This places each member of Sem Terra, through his\/her\nparticipation in the MST, in a movement that is related to the re-encounter\nof humanity with itself. The third dimension is building the educational project\nof different generations of the Sem Terra family, one that combines schooling\nwith broader concerns of human development and the training of militants.\nViewing the history of the MST in this perspective, we encounter some pedagogical\nlessons, or how the proponents of a social struggle and a collectivity in movement\ndeal with, and are concerned with, education. These lessons can help us reflect\non each of our own educational practices, including those that we undertake\nin the schools. Reflecting on these lessons, we may begin to understand something\neven more profound: the MST has a pedagogy, that is, it has a praxis\n(combined theory and practice) of how people are educated, of how human beings\ndevelop. The Pedagogy of the Sem Terra Movement is the way through which\nthe Movement has historically developed the social individual of the name Sem\nTerra, and has daily educated the people who are part of it. And the main\neducational principle of this pedagogy is the movement itself, a movement\nthat unites diverse pedagogies, and in a special way unites the pedagogy\nof social struggle with the pedagogy of the land and the pedagogy\nof history, each one helping to make an imprint on our identity, m\u00edstica,\nproject. Sem Terra is the name of one who fights for the people who have\nroots in the land the land that is won, tilled, cared for and in the movement\nThis is the main discussion we have today in the MST with our educators: how\nto make of the Pedagogy of the Movement a reference for our practice and our\nthought. To be an educator in the MST is to succeed in understanding the educational\ndimension of the Movement\u00eds actions, making them a mirror for its educational\npractices. It is a reference viewpoint to aid in discerning the limits and challenges\nof these practices. A mirror also educates our viewpoint to see beyond the\nMST, beyond the Sem Terra. The Pedagogy of the Movement takes shape\nin a dialogue with other educators, other students, and other pedagogical movements.\nIt was precisely in the interaction with people and works concerned with human\ndevelopment that we managed to think about the MST as a pedagogical subject.\nFrom this new synthesis, we continue our dialogue with theories and practices\nof human development, along with specific thinking on the educational environment\nof our schools.\nFrom this dialogue with the Movement\u00eds practices and the thinking on human\ndevelopment throughout the history of humanity, an initial result regards the\nvery concept of education. When we discuss practices of humanizing the field-workers\nas a product of education, we are in fact recovering an essential link to the\nwork in education: to educate is to humanize, to cultivate learning to be a\nThe MST works all the time at the limit between humanization and dehumanization;\nits struggle is that of life or death for thousands of people, who make their\nparticipation in the Movement a tool for re-learning to be human. This is the\nday-to-day task of the education of the Sem Terra in each march, each\ncamp, each settlement And it is this same day-to-day practice that shows that\nthe task is necessary and possible; that the adults\u00ed and the aged\u00eds nearly lost\nhumanity can be recovered through learning, and that it is even more necessary\nand possible to help in this learning from childhood.\nFrom this conception of education, there are pedagogical lessons we have managed\nto derive in this reflective counterpoint among the daily life of the MST, the\ndiverse theories and practices on human development, and the concerns with how\nto educate the Sem Terra. These are lessons that also help us think and\nrethink the curriculum and the educational environment of our schools.\n1. People are the greatest value produced and cultivated by the MST\nThe Movement is the way that people collectively produce the Sem\nTerra identity and carry out the struggle for agrarian reform that is the\nroot and strength of this identity. At times of the most acute social conflict,\nsuch as those we live through today, this is even more visible: it is on the\npeople, on each one of them, that resistance depends, as well as the determination\nof the proposals, the conduct that persists as an image for society, the continuity\nin the face of the fiercest conflicts, the identity. The MST has succeeded in\narriving at its seventeenth year because it has learned to value every person\nwho is a part of its organization, and because it has defined human development\nas one of its main priorities.\nAs educators, we need to be clear about what is in question every time we meet\nwith those we are educating: we are facing human beings, who deserve our respect\nand dedication as human beings, and as members of an organization that fights\nfor dignity. Our work in a school where the Sem Terra study, for example,\nneeds to be thought of in the perspective of a great educational effort, which\nmakes us responsible, interested, and committed.\nWe need to reflect always on some basic questions: what human being are we\nhelping to develop through our practice? Is there coherence with the humanity\nthat the MST struggle has been producing and planning for throughout its history?\nAnd those we educate: what human being do they see when they look at themselves\nand their settlement companions? Have our educational practices helped them\nto value themselves as persons and take on the collective identity they help\n2. People are educated by learning to be\nOne of the things that often calls attention to the MST\u00eds actions is the self-respect\nof the people who take part in it. This self-respect, or feeling of dignity,\nis produced to the extent that these people learn to be Sem Terra\nand to be proud of that name. And on taking on this social, collective identity\nwe are Sem Terra, we are of the MST these people gradually discover dimensions\nof their personal and collective identity, as well: I\u00edm a woman, I\u00edm black,\nI\u00edm a rural worker, I\u00edm young, I\u00edm an educator They are new individuals who\nare formed and begin to demand their place in the world, in history; they know\nthey can and ought to fight for the right to be human wherever they are, with\nor against whomever they are.\nThis returns us to the notion that this is an essential human task of learning:\nto look in the mirror of what we are and want to be, to take on personal and\ncollective identities, to be proud of them, at the same time we are challenged\nwith the movement of our permanent self-construction. To educate is to help\nbuild and strengthen identities, to draw faces, to form subjects. And this has\neverything to do with values, way of life, memory, culture.\n3. People are educated in the actions they perform and the works they produce\nThe MST forms the Sem Terra by putting them in a movement, which\nmeans in permanent action, action with the dynamic of a social struggle: occupations,\nencampments, marches, demonstrations of solidarity, the building of a new kind\nof life in the settlements, schools, activities of development. It is through\nsuch action that they learn that nothing is impossible to change, not even people,\ntheir propensities, their positions, their ways of life, their values.\nPeople are educated in action because it is the movement of action that molds\nthe way to becoming human. Actions produce and are produced through social relations:\nthat is, they set in motion another fundamental pedagogical element, which is\nthe interaction between people, how they behave among each other, which is measured\nby the tools inherited from those who have produced other tools before (culture).\nIn these relations, people show who they are, and at the same time they construct\nand revise their identities, their way of being.\nWe are speaking of any action, or of acting for acting\u00eds sake, without any\nintentionality. We are speaking of action that produces works (material or not)\nthat become the mirror in which people can see what they are or even want to\nbe; and we are speaking mainly of work and the material production of our existence.\nThere is no true education without action, without work, and without collective\nworks. And, as the children remind us, there is also no education without games\nand play, which can also be thought of as collective action producing works.\n4. People are educated by producing and reproducing culture\nThe actions of the Sem Terra are loaded with cultural meanings that\nthey learn to produce and express. In an occupation, on a march, or in the organization\nof a settlement, there appears not only what these families of workers are today,\nor at this particular moment. Every action brings together with it the way of\nbeing human that these people bear, the developing weight of the objective\ncircumstances of their whole previous existence and the type of education they\nhave received or lived. At the same time, their collective action is also usually\nthe negation of certain traditions that have marked their lives up to now, and\nthe projection of values they learn or re-learn in the pedagogical process of\nthe Movement. The MST\u00eds expressions, symbols, art, way of struggle, embody a\ncultural moment that neither begins nor ends at the moment of action. Each landless\nperson who enters the MST also enters a world already productive of symbols,\nexpressions, human examples, values, which, with each action, s\/he learns to\nsignify and resignify.\nOne of the great pedagogical challenges of the MST with its social base has\nbeen precisely to help people make a new cultural synthesis, one that joins\ntheir past, present, and future in a new, rooted collective and personal identity.\nTo live as if one struggles, to struggle as if one lives This is a coherent\nposition that has been seen as necessary to the Movement\u00eds aims of social transformation,\nas well as in its permanent conflicts and challenges. Memory, m\u00edstica,\ndiscussion of values, criticism and self-criticism, the study of history, these\nare some cultural tools that the Movement has been using in this construction.\nWe can reflect then that to educate is to also to share meanings and tools\nof culture (Jerome Bruner\u00eds expression, in Arroyo 2000). It is to help people\nin the learning of signfying and resignifying their actions, in\nsuch a way that they may transform them into values, behavior, convictions,\ncustoms, expressions, symbols, art, that is, into a way of life chosen\nand reflected by the collectivity of which they form a part. This means, among\nother things, that to educate people is help to cultivate their memory; it is\nto become acquainted and reacquainted with their symbols, expressions, words;\nit is to situate them in a wider cultural and historical universe; it is to\nwork with different languages, organize different moments and modes so that\npeople may think about their practices, their roots, their plans, their lives\n5. People are educated by living values\nValues are a fundamental dimension of culture; they are the principles of life,\nthat for which we consider it worth living. Values are what move our\npractices, our life, our being human. Values are what produce in people the\nneed to live for the sake of freedom and justice. Values are what move the striving\nof the Sem Terra to make their settlements utopian communities, consistent\nwith the struggle that won them over.\nThe MST has been very concerned with the cultivation of values, because it\nknows that it is the values, translated into culture, that it will leave as\na heritage to its descendants and the new generations of those who fight for\nthe people. And values only exist through people, their experiences, positions,\nconvictions. And they are not born with each one: they are learned, cultivated\nthrough the collective processes of development, of education.\nFor the MST, this has not been an easy battle: to recover and cultivate human\nvalues like solidarity, loyalty, the spirit of sacrifice for the collective\nwell-being, companionship, seriousness, discipline, indignation in the face\nof injustices, the valuing of the Sem Terra identity, humility - in a\nsociety that day by day degenerates with the counter-values of individualism,\nconsumerism, social apathy, lack of commitment to life, the exclusion of those\nwho take part in social struggles But it is only by taking on the job of educating\nand re-educating people in its values that the MST can realize the project of\n6. People are educated by learning how to solve problems\nIn the actions of a social struggle knowledge is acquired and produced,\nand it is a very important dimension of the strategy for the humanization of\nthe people. But one of the pedagogical lessons we have gleaned from the day-to-day\nlife of the Movement is that the process of producing knowledge that effectively\naids in the development of the person is that which is connected to the large\nand small questions of life. When a Sem Terra needs to know how to calculate\nan area in order to measure the land where his agro-villa will be settled, or\nwhen he needs to study geography to best choose the place for an occupation,\nthis knowledge will certainly have more human and social density for him. When\na Sem Terra child learns how to measure the materials that she needs\nto begin building her playground, or learns to write letters to people she likes,\nthe same thing occurs. The expression \"to know is to solve,\" from the Cuban\neducator Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, brings us to an even more radical question:\nit suggests to us that there is no true knowledge outside of concrete situations,\nor the solution to problems of \"real\" life. And it really seems to be so, especially\nwhen this question is put into the context of pedagogical processes.\nTo educate is to socialize knowledge and is also the tool for producing knowledge\nthat affects people\u00eds lives in their various dimensions of identity and universality.\nTo learn in order to solve problems means to understand knowledge as a comprehension\nof reality in order to transform it, comprehension of the human condition in\norder to make it fuller, which is a very old lesson that the Pedagogy of the\nMovement is merely recovering.\n7. People are educated by learning from the past to plan for the future\nIt was in this way that the Movement made itself as it is: learning from those\nwho had struggled before, cultivating the memory of their own path. History\nis made in this way: planning for the future beginning with the lessons of the\npast cultivated in the present. \u010eThe land holds the roots\u00ed, says one of the\nMST\u00eds songs. Education also must hold the roots, helping to cultivate\nthe memory of the people and in the development of historical consciousness.\nEducators have a very specific task for this: their meetings with their learners\ncan be a privileged time for learning to cultivate the collective memory, and\nfor the study of a broader history. To know that this can make a difference:\nthe memory of the debts to the people that were not paid, the wounds that were\nnot healed, is not erased.\nIt is necessary to educate every Sem Terra family so that their rural\nroots, their culture, and how these roots take part in the formation of the\nBrazilian people, are not forgotten, so that all the Sem Terra may learn\nhow they came to the condition of being rural landless workers, and how they\nhave many other brothers all over the world in a similar condition, who are\nalso carrying on a struggle for the land and for agrarian reform as we are.\nAnd as educators we also need to learn from this memory and its cultivation,\nnot to remain imprisoned in the past, but, on the contrary, to set it in motion\nand plan for the future what is best for everyone.\n8. People are educated in collectivities\nThe MST is a collectivity. And in it the Sem Terra learn that\nthe collective is the great subject of the struggle for land as well as its\ngreat educator. Nobody gets his\/her land by him\/herself; the occupations, the\nencampments, the settlements are collective works. The force of each person\nis in his roots, which is his part in a collectivity with a memory and project\nfor the future. It is through taking part in the collective and its works that\npeople are educated not alone, but in relation to others which potentializes\ntheir own singular, unique person.\nPeople do not learn to be human by themselves. Without the bonds of their participation\nin collectives they cannot go forward to a fully human condition. Uprooted people\nare dehumanized people, who do not recognize themselves in any past and have\nno project for the future. To educate is to help root people in strong collectives;\nit is to potentialize social, human harmony in the construction of identities,\nvalues, knowledge, feelings. An educational environment is fundamentally an\neducational collective, moved and planned by teachers, but shared by all of\nits members. In a true collective, all are at the same time educators and educated,\nbecause all are a part of the process of learning and re-learning to be human.\n9. The educator educates by conduct\nThe educator educates by conduct much more than by words. The strength of the\nMST is not in its speeches, but in its actions and in the positions of the Sem\nTerra who make them happen. It is the practices and the conduct of the collective\nthat educates the people who take part in the Movement or live with it.\nIt is for this reason that in the MST we have as educational references people\nlike Paulo Freire and Che Guevara. They were not educators only for what they\nsaid or wrote, but through the testimony of the consistency between what they\nthought, said, and effectively did and were, as persons and as militants in\nthe causes of the people.\nTo be an educator is, therefore, a way of being, a way of being with the people\nthat is a living message of values, convictions, feelings, of a conscience that\nmoves us and that we claim to defend in our organization. It is to have a complete\ncommittment, which is not easy. Only a collective can help us in the process\nof criticism and self-criticism, in the calls and in the affections that show\nus when we are vacillating and also show us the right path so that we may return\nIndividuals are not only formed in school. There are other experiences that\nproduce even stronger learning. The Pedagogy of the Movement is not contained\nby the school, because neither the Movement nor human development is contained\nby it. But the school is a part of the Movement and its pedagogy, so much so\nthat historically the MST has tenaciously fought so that all the Sem Terra\nmay have access to schools. The school that is a part of the Pedagogy of the\nMovement is the one that returns to its original task: taking part in human\nTo think of the school as a workshop of human development means to think\nof it as a place where the educational process or the process of human development\noccurs in an intentionally planned way, conducted and thought about for this\npurpose, a process that is guided by a project for society and the human being,\nand is sustained by the presence of people with specific knowledge for the work\nof education, by the sincere co-operation of everyone who is there to learn\nand to teach, and by the permanent link with other social practices that have\nbegun and continue this work.\nThe expression also helps us to rethink the pedagogical logic, or the pedagogical\nmethod of the school. We claim that the school is not only a place for teaching,\nand that a method of education is not the same as a method of teaching. It is\nnecessary to plan various pedagogical strategies in view of the different kinds\nof learning that make up the complex process of human development.\nIn a school conceived as a workshop of human development, educators are architects,\norganizers, and stimulators of the educational environment. This demands\ngreat sensitivity and mastery of the arts of pedagogy to form the schools from\na clear perception of how the educational process is developing in each student\nand in the collectivity as a whole; to perceive the contradictions and not be\noverwhelmed by them, but to work with them pedagogically; to be aware of what\ndimensions need to be emphasized at one moment or another, what type of actions\nneed to be performed and with what contents, what relations need to be worked\non and at what time.\nIt is a very important kind of learning: one needs to be humble enough to place\noneself always in the situation of an apprentice of the process, as apprentices\nthat we all are, of this complex art of building humanity, of which the MST\nalso has a part, albeit but a small one.\nArroyo, M.

Ordained in Brescia, Italy on 29 May 1920, he continued his studies in Rome, Italy, and became part of the Vatican secretariat of state in 1922. One of two pro-secretaries to Pope Pius XII. Archbishop of Milan from 1954 to 1963 where he worked on social problems and to improve relations between workers and employers. Created cardinal-priest of Santi Silvestro e Martino ai Monti on 15 December 1958. Elected 262nd Pope in 1963.\nAs Pope, Paul continued the reforms of John XXIII. He re-convened the Second Vatican Council, and supervised implementations of many of its reforms, such as the vernacularization and reform of the liturgy. He instituted an international synod of bishops; bishops were instructed to set up councils of priests in their own dioceses. Powers of dispensation devolved from the Roman Curia onto the bishops, rules on fasting and abstinence were relaxed, and some restrictions on inter-marriage were lifted. A commission to revise canon law revision was established.\nIn 1964, Paul made a pilgrimage to the Holy Lands, becoming the first pope in over 150 years to leave Italy. That was followed by trips to India in 1964, the United States in 1965, where he addressed the United Nations, Africa in 1969, and Southeast Asia in 1970. Relations between the Vatican and the Communists improved, and Communist leaders visited the Vatican for the first time. Paul met with leaders of other churches, and in 1969 addressed the World Council of Churches, and limited doctrinal agreements were reached with the Anglicans and Lutherans. Paul issued frequent reassertions of papal primacy in the face of growing dissent within the Roman Catholic Church itself. He enlarged the college of cardinals, and added cardinals from third world countries.\nIn the 1968 encyclical Humanae Vitae, Paul reaffirmed the church\u2019s ban on contraception, a disappointment to many liberals. It led to protests, and many national hierarchies openly modified the statement.

Raw juices from these foods can contain harmful bacteria, which can spread to other foods. Consider placing these raw foods inside plastic bags to keep the juices contained.\n- Don't purchase foods if the \"sell by\" date has passed.\n- Transport food home right away and refrigerate perishables immediately to prevent any bacteria from rapidly growing in the food.\n- When the weather's hot, place groceries in the air-conditioned passenger compartment of your car rather than the hot trunk. Bacteria can multiply rapidly at high temperatures.\n|Take Note, Moms-to-Be!\nDon't include these foods on your shopping list.

Cold temperatures keep most harmful bacteria from multiplying.\n- In cold water. Change the water every half-hour to keep the water cold.\n- Using the microwave, but cook the food immediately after it's defrosted.\nNote: Don't defrost foods at room temperature. Bacteria can grow in the \"danger zone,\" the range of temperatures usually between 40\u00b0 and 140\u00b0F (4\u00b0 and 60\u00b0C).\nBe creative and tempt your party guests with an array of fun platters, but keep food selections safe. Here's how:\n- Heating foods to the right temperature for the proper amount of time kills harmful bacteria, so cook meat, poultry, fish, and eggs thoroughly. For the recommended cooking temperatures, see Cook.\n- Some raw eggs can contain harmful bacteria. Some of your favorite homemade recipes may call for raw or lightly-cooked eggs. These may include recipes for Caesar salad dressing, ice cream, custards, chocolate mousse, and some sauces. Here are safe ways to make your favorite egg-containing foods:\n- Add the eggs to the amount of liquid called for in the recipe, then heat the mixture thoroughly.\n- Use store-bought products of the foods listed above, which are often already cooked or pasteurized.\n- Purchase pasteurized eggs. These eggs can be found in some supermarkets and are labeled \"pasteurized.\" Here are several types consumers can buy:\n- Fresh, pasteurized eggs in the shell (found in the refrigerator section).\n- Liquid, pasteurized egg products (found in the refrigerator section).\n- Frozen, pasteurized egg products (found in the frozen food section).\n- Powdered egg whites (found in the baking section).\nRefrigerate all perishables (foods that can spoil or become contaminated by bacteria if unrefrigerated) up until serving time. These foods include:\n- Finger sandwiches\n- Cheese chunks\n- Fruit salad\n- Foods that contain dairy products\nPlan a bacteria-free buffet with these helpful tips:\nIf you're planning a buffet at home and are not sure how quickly the food will be eaten, keep buffet portions small. Prepare a number of small platters and dishes ahead of time. Store cold back-up dishes in the refrigerator or keep hot dishes in the oven set at 200\u00b0 F to 250\u00b0 F (-73\u00b0 C to -23\u00b0 C) prior to serving. This way, your late-arriving guests can enjoy the same appetizing arrangements as the early arrivals.\nHot foods should be kept at an internal temperature of 140\u00b0 F (60\u00b0 C) or warmer. Use a food thermometer to check. Serve or keep food hot in chafing dishes, crock pots, and warming trays. Note: Some warmers only hold food at 110\u00b0 F to 120\u00b0 F (-163\u00b0 C to -153\u00b0 C), so check the product label to make sure your warmer has the capability to hold foods at 140\u00b0 F or warmer.\nCold foods should be kept at 40\u00b0 F (4 \u00b0 C) or colder. Keep cold foods refrigerated until serving time. If food is going to stay out on the buffet table longer than two hours, place plates of cold food on ice to retain the chill.\nKeep It Fresh\nDon't add new food to an already-filled serving dish. Instead, replace nearly-empty serving dishes with freshly-filled ones. Bacteria from people's hands may have contaminated the food. Plus, bacteria may have started to multiply at room temperature.\nWatch the Clock\nRemember the 2-Hour Rule: Discard any perishables left out at room temperature for more than two hours, unless you're keeping it hot or cold. If the buffet is held in a place where the temperature is above 90\u00b0F, the safe-holding time is reduced to one hour.\nLeaving with Leftovers?\nBe sure to refrigerate leftovers immediately after you arrive home.","id":"<urn:uuid:942da8bb-7c73-4c1b-968e-adea42d1c804>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.fda.gov\/Food\/FoodborneIllnessContaminants\/PeopleAtRisk\/ucm083680.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9088973999,"token_count":1269,"score":2.859375,"int_score":3}

The effect of more frequent hurricanes, floods and droughts on developing countries is devastating, as this year\u2019s cyclone Nagris proved again in southern Myanmar, leaving over 130,000 people dead or missing.\nTo protect the world\u2019s poor against today\u2019s more frequent extreme weather events, some US$ 2 billion is required according to the Internacional relief agency Oxfam. However, commitments so far only total US$173.\nThe need for innovative means to mitigate climate change impacts and help poor countries adapt is high on the agenda of the World Conservation Congress, held by IUCN, the International Union for Conservation of Nature from 5-14 October in Barcelona.\n- In 2007, there were 950 natural catastrophes in 2007 compared with 850 in 2006, according to Munich Re, one of the world\u2019s largest insurance companies. This is the highest number recorded since the company started compiling annual disaster reports in 1974.\n- The burden of the disasters fall on the poor who are least to blame for climate change.

Jimi Hendrix perfectly captured that psychedelic era in the country, that time of opening the doors of perception in one's mind and really looking at something on a deeper level.\"\nHe said the \"purple\" Hendrix is referring to is that new, unknown, almost analogous way of thinking.\n\"Metaphorically, purple was a blend between the standardized 'primary colors' introduced by mainstream society in the 1950s and mid-1960s,\" Maxwell said.\nOther artists, such as Deep Purple and Prince, adopted the color because of its ambiguity in the musical soundscape and pop culture.\nDeep Purple was one of the pioneers of hard rock and heavy metal, Maxwell said. The group was the first rock band to record with a full Concerto orchestra, as well as the first to turn the volume to 11, a feat earning them the title of the world's loudest band by the Guinness Book of World Records in 1972.\nAnd then there's the song \"Smoke on the Water.\"\n\"When that song came out it was such a fresh thing,\" Maxwell said. \"No longer was the focus just on the lyrics. That guitar riff made the music as important as the words. Today most people don't remember the lyrics but they know that guitar lick.\"\nIn 1984 Prince released \"Purple Rain,\" an album that took the newly introduced music video to the next level as a full-length film.\nThe album also introduced Prince's backing band. The Revolution, an apt title due to the soundtrack's revolutionary nature, Maxwell said. The album has since been seen as an avant-garde piece of work and has been named one of the greatest albums of all time by outlets like Time magazine, Rolling Stone, VH1 and others.\n\"Purple's taking the softness of blue, the loudness of red, and meeting in the middle to make things a little ambiguous. It's a blend of those two primary colors and is therefore a different way of looking at things,\" he said.","id":"<urn:uuid:8671d356-590d-4599-a2d6-8c2ddd04c134>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.k-state.edu\/media\/newsreleases\/feb11\/purplemusic20711.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9774608016,"token_count":798,"score":3.140625,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Marion Levine teaches English, Literature and Film Production at Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies, Los Angeles, CA\nMeasure for Measure, Act 4 or 5\nWhat's On for Today and Why\nStudents will choose a character from Measure for Measure and create a \"back story\" for that character. This will encourage students to read the text closely looking for clues regarding a specific character's history. Students will re-read a portion of the text and then write about what has happened to the character before the play begins. They will then create an artifact, such as a diary or journal entry, written by the charcacter they have selected. This will allow them the opportunity to think like the character and to view the events of the play from a specific point of view.\nThis lesson will take two 40 minute class periods.\nWhat You Need\nMeasure for Measure, Folger Edition\nWhat To Do\n1. Explain the concept of a \"back story\" as the important events that occur to a character before the play begins. You may need to prompt students with questions such as:\nWhat was the character like as a child?\nIn what situation did he\/she grow up?\nStudents will need to show how the script supports their choices.\n2. Have the students write a one or two page back story in either the first or third person.\n3. Divide students into small groups of 4 or 5 and have them re-read Act 4 or Act 5, combing throught the text for character details.\n4. Have students write a letter, diary or journal entry from their selected characters point of view (first person). This artifact should concern one or more characters in the play.\n5. For increased authenticity, appropriate for an \"Extra-Extended\" book, students could write their letter, diary entry using calligraphy, a handwriting font or on a piece of yellowed paper.\n6. Allow students time to read their pieces and share their artifacts with the class.\nHow Did It Go?\nWere students able to justify their choices with reference to the text? Did their artifacts accurately portray character traits that can be interpreted from the text? Were students able to convey a sense of the character's perspective through this activity?\nThis lesson could be applied to any fictional text that the students read in class. Through close reading and attention to a specific character, students are able to identify with, and understand the concerns of a character on a deeper level. Possible choices could include Jay Gatsby, Hester Prynne,and Atticus Finch.\nIf you used this lesson, we would like to hear how it went and about any adaptations you made to suit the needs of YOUR students.","id":"<urn:uuid:86849ab7-4070-40ee-9f28-f23c0e6d4e97>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/folger.edu\/eduLesPlanDtl.cfm?lpid=863","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9481241107,"token_count":553,"score":4.0625,"int_score":4}
{"text":"Living with Diabetes\nDiabetes is a condition that affects everyone from children right up to adults. It is referred as a chronic condition since a person who has it can go through many changes in their lives as it can affect their entire body. Over time, diabetes can cause blindness, stroke, and amputations among other things.\nThere are two types of diabetes; Juvenile or Type 1 diabetes and adult-onset diabetes also known as Type 2 diabetes. The more common form of diabetes is Type 2 and those who have this type of diabetes are faced many difficulties and complications to their liver, muscle and even fat cells. In the case of Type 1 diabetics, they are required to use insulin to be able to combat the effects of diabetes.\nA simple blood sugar test can determine if you have diabetes or not. The doctor usually checks the level of your glucose to determine if you are diabetic. There are also telltale signs that one is diabetic as well. The symptoms of diabetes include an increase in thirst; feeling tired all the time, headaches, and weight loss and in some cases blurred vision and even dry mouth.\nThere is a treatment for diabetes and one can easily keep it under control if proper measures are taken. One must first keep their blood glucose in check all the time and one way to achieve this is by eating healthy foods for diabetics. One can also combat the symptoms of diabetes by keeping up with an exercise regimen and it would also help to keep their weight under control as well.","id":"<urn:uuid:9a5aede2-83a0-4dea-ac64-71fa514ed29c>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.diabetescondition.com\/living-with-diabetes\/living-with-diabetes\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9736893773,"token_count":305,"score":2.9375,"int_score":3}
{"text":"If farmers are to increase food production and food security, they need better access to agricultural support systems, such as credit, technology, extension services and agricultural education, as well as to the rural organizations that often channel other services. Both men and women smallholders and poor farmers have frequently been cut off from these essential agricultural support systems, which seldom take into account the different responsibilities and needs of men and women farmers. In spite of their enormous potential and their crucial roles in agricultural production, women in particular have insufficient access to production inputs and support services.\nThis trend underlines the need to implement measures aimed at enhancing the access of small farmers, especially women, to production inputs - particularly since the working environment of development organizations has\nchanged as a result of market liberalization and a reduced role for the state worldwide. National agricultural extension systems are no exception to this rule, and must respond by making internal and external adjustments. Great attention is required so that the adjustments do not become detrimental to women and men small farmers. For example, FAO's field experiences over the last decade have pointed to the need for extension programmes that are more strategically planned, needs-based, participatory and problem solving.\nWomen's access to and use of agricultural support systems is also severely limited by the heavy burden on time and energy that results from their triple responsibilities - productive activities (such as work in the fields), reproductive activities (such as child rearing, cooking and household chores) and community management.\nIn order to improve production, farmers need access to financial capital. Buying seeds, fertilizer and other agricultural inputs often requires short-term loans, which are repaid when the crops are harvested. Installing major improvements, such as irrigation pumps, or acquiring new technology that increases future yields is impossible without access to long-term credit.\nSmallholders, particularly women, often face difficulties in obtaining credit. This is a direct consequence of their lacking access to land, participation in development projects and extension programmes and membership in rural organizations, all of which are important channels for obtaining loans and credit information. In several countries of sub-Saharan Africa, where women and men farmers are roughly equal in number, it is estimated that women farmers receive only 10 percent of the loans granted to smallholders and less than 1 percent of the total credit advanced to the agriculture sector.\nCredit delivery can be improved by setting up microfinance institutions in rural areas and reorienting the banking system to cater to the needs of small farmers, especially women. The Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, which first pioneered the microcredit approach in 1976, currently reaches more than 2 million people. Since it was founded, the bank has lent more than US$2.1 billion, most of it in the form of loans of a few hundred dollars for small agriculture, distribution, crafts and trading enterprises. Numerous studies have shown that women are generally more reliable and punctual in repaying their loans than men are.\nA programme providing credit and nutrition for women significantly improved both the participating women's incomes and their children's nutritional status. This is the conclusion of a study that examined the impact of a credit and education programme run by the NGO Freedom from Hunger.\nMen and women smallholders also suffer financially from limited access to the marketing services that would allow them to turn surplus produce into cash income. Women face particular difficulties because marketing infrastructure and organizations are rarely geared towards either small-scale producers or the crops that women grow. Although women all over the world are active as traders, hawkers and street and market vendors, little has been done to improve transport and market facilities to support this vital economic sector. Even where rural women play an important role in wholesale trade, their full membership in marketing service institutions is still difficult because they may be illiterate or lack independent legal status.\nPlanning for action\nThe FAO Gender and Development Plan of Action includes commitments by different Divisions of FAO to increasing the equality of access to a wide range of agricultural support systems, including markets, credit, technology, extension and training.\nRural finance and marketing services\nRural groups and organizations\nAgricultural research and technology\nAgricultural education and extension\nMicrocredit and education boost incomes and nutrition\nAstudy examined the impact of a microcredit and educational programme implemented by the NGO Freedom from Hunger. In Ghanaian villages, women who participated in the programme used microcredit loans to launch income-generating activities such as preparing and selling palm oil, fish and cooked foods. They increased their non-farm income by $36 per month, twice as much as the women who had not taken part in the programme. Through the programme's educational component, participating women also gained valuable knowledge about their children's nutrition and heath needs.\nMembership of cooperatives, farmers' organizations, trade unions and other organizations represents one of the best ways for rural men and women to gain access to resources, opportunities and decision-making. Cooperatives and farmers' associations generally make it possible for farmers to share the costs and rewards of services that they could not afford on their own. They can be an invaluable channel for obtaining technology, information, training and credit. They can also give smallholders a much louder voice in local and national decision-making. By instituting common food processing, storage and marketing activities, organizations can increase the exchange of goods and services and the access to national and regional markets.\nParticipation in such organizations can be especially important to smallholders and poor farmers, both men and women. But women are frequently deterred from joining because membership is often restricted to recognized landowners or heads of household. Even when women are responsible for the day-to-day management of both households and holdings, their husbands or other male relatives are often considered the official heads.\nIn many regions, women farmers' membership of these organizations is restricted by custom. Where they are able to belong to rural organizations, women often do not share equally in either the decision-making or the benefits, and are excluded from leadership positions. Furthermore, their many household chores may make it impossible for them to attend meetings and devote the time that is necessary for full participation. Investment in labour-saving technologies to relieve the burden of women's unpaid productive and reproductive tasks is needed in order to given them more free time.\nIn recent years there has been some success in reducing the obstacles to women's participation in rural organizations. At the same time, the use and establishment of traditional and new women's groups to promote women's participation in rural development has grown rapidly. However, experience has shown that women's empowerment often requires a step-by-step process to remove the barriers to their membership in organizations that are traditionally dominated by men. Furthermore, it is necessary to give them support, individually or collectively, to enable them to gain the knowledge and self-confidence needed to make choices and take greater control of their lives.\nIn all regions of the developing world, women typically work far longer hours than men do. Studies in Asia and Africa show that women work as much as 13 extra hours a week. As a result, they may have little available time to seek out support services, and very different priorities for the kind of support required.\nOverall, the agricultural research agenda has neglected the needs of smallholders, especially women farmers, and failed to take advantage of their invaluable knowledge about traditional farming methods, indigenous plant and animal varieties and coping techniques for local conditions. Such knowledge could hold the key to developing sustainable approaches that combine modern science with the fruits of centuries of experimentation and adaptation by men and women farmers.\nMost research has focused on increasing the yields of commercial crops and staple grains on high-input farms, where high-yielding varieties can be cultivated under optimal conditions. Smallholders can rarely afford these technology \u00abpackages\u00bb, which are also generally ill suited to the climatic and soil conditions in areas where most of the rural poor live. The crops that farmers in such areas rely on and the conditions that they face have not featured prominently in agricultural research. Sorghum and millet, for example, have received very little research attention and funding, despite their high nutritional value and ability to tolerate difficult conditions. Similarly, relatively little research has been devoted to the secondary crops grown by women, which often provide most of their family's nutritional needs.\nIn addition, agricultural tools and implements are also rarely designed to fit women's physical capabilities or work, so they do not meet women's needs. The impact of new technologies is seldom evaluated from a gender perspective. The introduction of harvesting, threshing and milling machinery, for example, has very little direct effect on yields but eliminates thousands of hours of paid labour. According to one study, if all the farmers in Punjab, India, who cultivate more than 4 ha were to use combine harvesters, they would lose more than 40 million paid working days, without any increase in farm production or cropping intensity. Most of the lost labour and income would be women's.\n\u00abSchools where men and women farmers learn how to increase yields and reduce their reliance on pesticides by relying on natural predators.\u00bb\nDeveloping technology to meet women's specific needs can yield major gains in food production and food security. In Ghana, for example, technology was introduced to improve the irrigation of women's off-season crops. Larger and more reliable harvests increased both food and economic security during the periods between major crops. In El Salvador, where women play an extremely important role in agriculture, it is estimated that as many as 60 percent of households are headed by women. One of the major goals of this country's agriculture sector reform was to improve research and extension activities by focusing on the role of women smallholders. To address women farmers' needs, the project promoted women's participation to help guide the research programme at National Agricultural Technology Centre farms.\nFarmer field schools in Cambodia\nIn fields across Cambodia, men and women farmers gather every week to go to school. They are among the 30 000 Cambodian farmers - more than one-third of them women - who have taken part in FAO-supported farmer field schools (FFS). In the schools, farmers observe how crops develop and monitor pests throughout the growing season. They also learn how natural predators, such as wasps and spiders, can help control pests and how the heavy use of pesticides often kills them off, leaving crops even more vulnerable. These schools emphasize the active participation and empowerment of both men and women farmers. In at least six provinces in Cambodia, farmers have formed integrated pest management (IPM) groups after completing their training, and are carrying out further field studies and experiments. More than 300 farmers have completed additional training and are now organizing farmer field schools in their own areas. \u00ab;I always knew pesticides were bad for my health,\u00bb one participant said, \u00abbut now I know for sure.\u00bb After completing the school, farmers rely more on cultural practices and natural enemies to control pests, and experience fewer cases of poisoning.\nAgricultural extension programmes provide farmers with a lifeline of information about new technologies, plant varieties and market opportunities. In almost all countries, however, the agricultural extension system fails to reach women farmers effectively. Among other reasons, this is because they are excluded from rural organizations. An FAO survey showed that, worldwide, female farmers receive only 5 percent of all agricultural extension services and only 15 percent of agricultural extension agents are women. In Egypt, where women make up more than half of the agricultural labour force, only 1 percent of extension officers are female.\n\u00abAn FAO extension project in Honduras that focused on woman-to-woman training boosted both subsistence production and household food security.\u00bb\nThis reflects the lack of information and understanding about the important role played by women. Extension services usually focus on commercial rather than subsistence crops, which are grown mainly by women and which are often the key to household food security. Available data rarely reflect women's responsibility for much of the day-to-day work and decision-making on the family farm. Nor do they recognize the many other important food production and food processing activities that women commonly perform, such as home gardening, tending livestock, gathering fuel or carrying water.\nExtension programmes can be tailored to address women's priority needs only when men and women farmers are listened to at the village level and when such methods as participatory rural appraisal are employed. In recent years, a number of countries have launched determined efforts to make their extension services more responsive to women's needs. In the Gambia, for example, the proportion of female agricultural extension workers has increased from 5 percent in 1989 to more than 60 percent today. Growth in the number of female extension workers has been matched by increased attention to women's involvement and priorities. A special effort has been made to encourage women's participation in small ruminant and poultry extension services.\nIn Nicaragua, efforts to ensure that extension services match client needs - including giving more attention to the diverse needs of men and women farmers - led to increased use of those services, by 600 percent for women and 400 percent for men.\nExtension programmes that fail to take women into account also fail to address the improved technology and methods that might yield major gains in productivity and food security. Furthermore, they often schedule training times and locations that make it impossible for women to participate, in addition to existing socio-cultural reasons.\nRecommended new approaches include the Strategic Extension Campaign (SEC), which was developed by FAO and introduced in Africa, the Near East, Asia and Latin America. This methodology emphasizes how important it is for field extension workers and small farmers to participate in the strategic planning, systematic management and field implementation of agricultural extension and training programmes. Its extension strategies and messages are specifically developed and tailored to the results of a participatory problem identification and needs assessment.\nTraining Programme for Women's Incorporation in Rural Development\nSeveral hundred peasant women in Honduras were trained to serve as \u00abfood production liaisons\u00bb. After receiving their training, the liaisons worked with grassroots women's groups. They focused on impoverished rural areas where chronic malnutrition is widespread and 70 percent of all breastfeeding mothers suffer from vitamin A deficiency. Women involved with the project increased the subsistence production of nutritious foods. Credits to develop poultry production proved an effective way of increasing motivation, nutritional levels and incomes. Some of the grassroots women's groups involved with the project sought credit through extension agencies or from the Rotating Fund for Peasant Women. The credit was used to initiate other social and productive projects, including purchasing a motorized maize mill and planting soybeans for milk.","id":"<urn:uuid:6d3aa950-7ad5-4c80-bb68-e826841338b7>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.fao.org\/docrep\/005\/Y3969E\/y3969e05.htm","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9660889506,"token_count":2945,"score":3.21875,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Twenty Ideas for Engaging ProjectsSeptember 12, 2011 | Suzie Boss\nThe start of the school year offers an ideal time to introduce students to project-based learning. By starting with engaging projects, you'll grab their interest while establishing a solid foundation of important skills, such as knowing how to conduct research, engage experts, and collaborate with peers. In honor of Edutopia's 20th anniversary, here are 20 project ideas to get learning off to a good start.\n1. Flat Stanley Refresh: Flat Stanley literacy projects are perennial favorites for inspiring students to communicate and connect, often across great distances. Now Flat Stanley has his own apps for iPhone and iPad, along with new online resources. Project founder Dale Hubert is recently retired from the classroom, but he's still generating fresh ideas to bring learning alive in the \"flatlands.\"\n2. PBL is No Accident: In West Virginia, project-based learning has been adopted as a statewide strategy for improving teaching and learning. Teachers don't have to look far to find good project ideas. In this CNN story about the state's educational approach, read about a project that grew out of a fender-bender in a school parking lot. When students were asked to come up with a better design for the lot, they applied their understanding of geometry, civics, law, engineering, and public speaking. Find more good ideas in West Virginia's Teach21 project library.\n3. Defy Gravity: Give your students a chance to investigate what happens near zero gravity by challenging them to design an experiment for NASA to conduct at its 2.2 second drop tower in Brookpark, Ohio. Separate NASA programs are offered for middle school and high school. Or, propose a project that may land you a seat on the ultimate roller coaster (aka: the \"vomit comet\"), NASA aircraft that produces periods of micro and hyper gravity ranging from 0 to 2 g's. Proposal deadline is Sept. 21, and flight week takes place in February 2012.\n4. Connect Across Disciplines: When students design and build kinetic sculptures, they expand their understanding of art, history, engineering, language arts, and technology. Get some interdisciplinary project insights from the Edutopia video, Kinetic Conundrum. Click on the accompanying links for more tips about how you can do it, too.\n5. Honor Home Languages: English language learners can feel pressured to master English fast, with class time spent correcting errors instead of using language in meaningful ways. Digital IS, a site published by the National Writing Project, shares plans for three projects that take time to honor students' home languages and cultures, engaging them in critical thinking, collaboration, and use of digital tools. Anne Herrington and Charlie Moran curate the project collection, \"English Language Learners, Digital Tools, and Authentic Audiences.\"\n6. Rethink Lunch: Make lunch into a learning opportunity with a project that gets students thinking more critically about their mid-day meal. Center for Ecoliteracy offers materials to help you start, including informative including informative essays and downloadable planning guides. Get more ideas from this video about a middle-school nutrition project, \"A Healthy School Lunch.\"\n7. Take a Learning Expedition: Expeditionary Learning schools take students on authentic learning expeditions, often in neighborhoods close to home. Check out the gallery for project ideas about everything from the tools people use in their work to memories of the Civil Rights Movement.\n8. Find a Pal: If PBL is new to you, consider joining an existing project. You'll benefit from a veteran colleague's insights, and your students will get a chance to collaborate with classmates from other communities or even other countries. Get connected at ePals, a global learning community for educators from more than 200 countries.\n9. Get Minds Inquiring: What's under foot? What are things made of? Science projects that emphasize inquiry help students make sense of their world and build a solid foundation for future understanding. The Inquiry Project supports teachers in third to fifth grades as they guide students in hands-on investigations about matter. Students develop the habits of scientists as they make observations, offer predictions, and gather evidence. Companion videos show how scientists use the same methods to explore the world. Connect inquiry activities to longer-term projects, such as creating a classroom museum that showcases students' investigations.\n10. Learn through Service: When cases of the West Nile virus were reported in their area, Minnesota students sprang into action with a project that focused on preventing the disease through public education. Their project demonstrates what can happen when service-learning principles are built into PBL. Find more ideas for service-learning projects from the National Youth Leadership Council.\n11. Locate Experts: When students are learning through authentic projects, they often need to connect with experts from the world outside the classroom. Find the knowledgeable experts you need for STEM projects through the National Lab Network. It's an online network where K-12 educators can locate experts from the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\n12. Build Empathy: Projects that help students see the world from another person's perspective build empathy along with academic outcomes. The Edutopia video, \"Give Me Shelter\", shows what compassionate learning looks like in action. Click on the companion links for more suggestions about how you can do it, too.\n13. Investigate Climate Science: Take students on an investigation of climate science by joining the newest collaborative project hosted by GLOBE, Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment. The Student Climate Research Campaign includes three components: introductory activities to build a foundation of understanding, intensive observing periods when students around the world gather and report data, and research investigations that students design and conduct. Climate project kicks off Sept. 12.\n14. Problem-Solvers Unite: Math fairs take mathematics out of the classroom and into the community, where everyone gets a chance to try their hand at problem solving. Galileo Educational Network explains how to host a math fair. In a nutshell, students set up displays of their math problems but not the solutions. Then they entice their parents and invited guests to work on solutions. Make the event even more engaging by inviting mathematicians to respond to students' problems.\n15. Harvest Pennies : Can small things really add up to big results? It seems so, based on results of the Penny Harvest. Since the project started in New York in 1991, young philanthropists nationwide have raised and donated more than $8 million to charitable causes, all through penny drives. The project website explains how to organize students in philanthropy roundtables to study community issues and decide which causes they want to support.\n16. Gather Stories: Instead of teaching history from textbooks, put students in the role of historian and help them make sense of the past. Learn more about how to plan oral history projects in the Edutopia story, \"Living Legends.\" Teach students about the value of listening by having them gather stories for StoryCorps.\n17. Angry Bird Physics: Here's a driving question to kickstart a science project: \"What are the laws of physics in Angry Birds world?\" Read how physics teachers like Frank Noschese and John Burk are using the web version of the popular mobile game in their classrooms.\n18. Place-Based Projects: Make local heritage, landscapes, and culture the jumping-off point for compelling projects. That's the idea behind place-based education, which encourages students to look closely at their communities. Often, they wind up making significant contributions to their communities, as seen in the City of Stories project.\n19. News They Can Use: Students don't have to wait until they're grown-ups to start publishing. Student newspapers, radio stations, and other journalism projects give them real-life experiences now. Award-winning journalism teacher Esther Wojcicki outlines the benefits this post on the New York Times Learning Network. Get more ideas about digital-age citizen journalism projects at MediaShift Idea Lab.\n20. The Heroes They Know: To get acquainted with students at the start of the year and also introduce students to PBL processes, High Tech High teacher Diana Sanchez asked students to create a visual and textual representation of a hero in their own life. Their black-and-white exhibits were a source of pride to students, as Sanchez explains in her project reflection . Get more ideas from the project gallery at High Tech High, a network of 11 schools in San Diego County that emphasize PBL. To learn more, watch this Edutopia video interview with High Tech High founding principal Larry Rosenstock.\nPlease tell us about the projects you are planning for this school year. Questions about PBL? Draw on the wisdom of your colleagues by starting discussions or asking for help in the PBL community.","id":"<urn:uuid:6d6b12c8-51d9-4d93-b798-19f2bbb48a21>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.edutopia.org\/blog\/20-ideas-for-engaging-projects-suzie-boss?quicktabs_edutopia_blogs_sidebar_popular_list=0","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9446845651,"token_count":1793,"score":3.515625,"int_score":4}
{"text":"Link back to index.html\nThe Death and Dying Process\nDeath and Dying\nAs caregivers, one either becomes a better person through compassion, patience, and humor, or they become embittered and angry. Wendy Lustbader is an author who has written a moving book entitled \" Counting on Kindness: The Dilemmas of Dependency.\"1991. The Free Press, New York, New York. In the book she describes the importance of receiving gratitude when we help others; because giving help without recognition can embitter us as individuals. We need to be kind, in order to count on kindness as we age.\nThe person who has dementia cannot always provide gratitude for their caregiver. Gratitude must be looked for in gentle ways and unassuming ways. Perhaps it is a smile, or a gesture, or an expression of love such as placing the head on the caregiver's shoulder. If gratitude is not felt even on an occasional basis, it is difficult to cope with death and dying. Death and dying as Dr. Kubler-Ross indicates, is the \"final stage of growth\".\nDeath and Dying\nDuring the final stages of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, an individual may lose his\/her ability to ambulate, verbally communicate, swallow, or may become totally incontinent and continue to lose weight despite nutritional supplements. Usually people with Alzheimer's die of another problem---perhaps a stroke, or pneumonia due to aspiration. At this point, the caregiver must be aware that the only way a person can stay alive is by inserting a stomach tube that provides artificial nutritional sustenance.\nCaregivers may have different feelings about this intervention for religious or personal reasons. At the end stage of Alzheimer's the use of invasive procedures such as a stomach tube, can keep the persons alive from months to years. This important decision must be made by the family member and can create an \"ethical dilemma\". Families, should in no way feel pressured by a medical professional to insert life sustaining interventions.\nWhen family members are prepared with regard to the physical process of death and dying they are more able to accept death as an inevitable and peaceful process. The recent expansion of Hospice Services has done much to promote discussions about death and acceptance of withholding end-of-life medical interventions. Once a person is terminal, as determined by a physician who understands the disease process, a caregiver may decide to engage Hospice Services. The physician must be willing to certify that a person will die within six months. If the person does not die within six months, they are not disqualified from the program.\nHospice Services are usually provided by a local Home Health Agency. Hospice services can be provided in the home, assisted living facility as well as a skilled nursing facility. When a family signs up for Hospice Benefits they agree to forgo extreme invasive procedures and agree to support procedures that alleviate pain for the person with dementia. This is known as \"palliative care\" or comfort measures. At the final stage of death, water and food are withheld as the individual no longer desires this. This is a part of the natural process of dying.\nFamilies can anticipate the final stages of death by the various physical stages a person may be going through. Barbara Karne, a Hospice R.N. developed a very comprehensive booklet entitled \"Gone From My Sight: The Dying Experience\" which delineates the various physical stages of death and dying. To obtain a booklet, contact her at the following address: Barbara Karnes, R.N., P.O. Box 335, Stillwell, Kansas, 60085, 1995.\nIn Karnes' booklet she describes what occurs, one-three months prior to death, one to two weeks before death, days or hours before death, and then the final minutes. This information has been extremely helpful to families and can be summarized as follows:\nOne to three months prior to death\n\u00b7 Withdrawal from world and people\n\u00b7 Decreased food intake\n\u00b7 Increased sleep\n\u00b7 Going inside self\n\u00b7 Less Communication\nOne to Two Weeks Prior to Death\n\u00b7 Talking with Unseen\n\u00b7 Picking at Clothes\n\u00b7 Physical Changes\no Decreased blood pressure\no Pulse increase or decrease\no Color changes; pale, bluish\no Increased perspiration\no Respiration irregularities\no Sleeping but responding\no Complaints of body tired and heavy\no Not eating, taking little fluids\no Body temperature hot\/cold\nDays or Hours\n\u00b7 Intensification of 1-2 week signs\n\u00b7 Surge of energy\n\u00b7 Decrease in blood pressure\n\u00b7 Eyes glassy, tearing, half open\n\u00b7 Irregular breathing, stop\/start\n\u00b7 Restlessness or no activity\n\u00b7 Purplish knees, feet, hands, blotchy\n\u00b7 Pulse weak and hard to fine\n\u00b7 Decreased urine output\n\u00b7 May wet or stool the bed\n\u00b7 Fish out of water breathing\n\u00b7 Cannot be awakened\nIt is important that individuals be aware of their wishes and that the wishes be formally documented in a legal document that is known as an \"Advance Directive\". Each state has different instruments for these directives and the caregiver should contact the local medical facility to determine the appropriate document to be used. The Advance Directive delineates one's wishes regarding medical treatment and appoints a surrogate decision-maker on a person's behalf. Of course, the important aspect of the Advance Directive is to discuss end-of-life care before one becomes diagnosed with dementia or has an another debilitating illness.\npp.309-311.

{"text":"WE have in this chapter to consider why the females of many birds have not acquired the same ornaments as the male; and why, on the other hand, both sexes of many other birds are equally, or almost equally, ornamented? In the following chapter we shall consider the few cases in which the female is more conspicuously coloured than the male.\nIn my Origin of Species* I briefly suggested that the long tail of the peacock would be inconvenient and the conspicuous black colour of the male capercailzie dangerous, to the female during the period of incubation: and consequently that the transmission of these characters from the male to the female offspring had been checked through natural selection. I still think that this may have occurred in some few instances: but after mature reflection on all the facts which I have been able to collect, I am now inclined to believe that when the sexes differ, the successive variations have generally been from the first limited in their transmission to the same sex in which they first arose. Since my remarks appeared, the subject of sexual colouration has been discussed in some very interesting papers by Mr. Wallace,*(2) who believes that in almost all cases the successive variations tended at first to be transmitted equally to both sexes; but that the female was saved, through natural selection, from acquiring the conspicuous colours of the male, owing to the danger which she would thus have incurred during incubation.\n* Fourth edition, 1866, p. 241.\n*(2) Westminster Review, July, 1867. Journal of Travel, vol. i., 1868, p. 73.\nThis view necessitates a tedious discussion on a difficult point, namely, whether the transmission of a character, which is at first inherited by both sexes can be subsequently limited in its transmission to one sex alone by means of natural selection. We must bear in mind, as shewn in the preliminary chapter on sexual selection, that characters which are limited in their development to one sex are always latent in the other. An imaginary illustration will best aid us in seeing the difficulty of the case; we may suppose that a fancier wished to make a breed of pigeons, in which the males alone should be coloured of a pale blue, whilst the females retained their former slaty tint. As with pigeons characters of all kinds are usually transmitted to both sexes equally, the fancier would have to try to convert this latter form of inheritance into sexually-limited transmission. All that he could do would be to persevere in selecting every male pigeon which was in the least degree of a paler blue; and the natural result of this process, if steadily carried on for a long time, and if the pale variations were strongly inherited or often recurred, would be to make his whole stock of a lighter blue. But our fancier would be compelled to match, generation after generation, his pale blue males with slaty females, for he wishes to keep the latter of this colour. The result would generally be the production either of a mongrel piebald lot, or more probably the speedy and complete loss of the pale-blue tint; for the primordial slaty colour would be transmitted with prepotent force. Supposing, however, that some pale-blue males and slaty females were produced during each successive generation, and were always crossed together, then the slaty females would have, if I may use the expression, much blue blood in their veins, for their fathers, grandfathers, &c., will all have been blue birds. Under these circumstances it is conceivable (though I know of no distinct facts rendering it probable) that the slaty females might acquire so strong a latent tendency to pale-blueness, that they would not destroy this colour in their male offspring, their female offspring still inheriting the slaty tint. If so, the desired end of making a breed with the two sexes permanently different in colour might be gained.\nThe extreme importance, or rather necessity in the above case of the desired character, namely, pale-blueness, being present though in a latent state in the female, so that the male offspring should not be deteriorated, will be best appreciated as follows: the male of Soemmerring's pheasant has a tail thirty-seven inches in length, whilst that of the female is only eight inches; the tail of the male common pheasant is about twenty inches, and that of the female twelve inches long. Now if the female Soemmerring pheasant with her short tail were crossed with the male common pheasant, there can be no doubt that the male hybrid offspring would have a much longer tail than that of the pure offspring of the common pheasant. On the other hand, if the female common pheasant, with a tail much longer than that of the female Soemmerring pheasant, were crossed with the male of the latter, the male hybrid offspring would have a much shorter tail than that of the pure offspring of Soemmerring's pheasant.*\n* Temminck says that the tail of the female Phasianus Soemmerringii is only six inches long, Planches coloriees, vol. v., 1838, pp. 487 and 488: the measurements above given were made for me by Mr. Sclater. For the common pheasant, see Macgillivray, History of British Birds, vol. i., pp. 118-121.\nOur fancier, in order to make his new breed with the males of a pale-blue tint, and the females unchanged, would have to continue selecting the males during many generations; and each stage of paleness would have to be fixed in the males, and rendered latent in the females. The task would be an extremely difficult one, and has never been tried, but might possibly be successfully carried out. The chief obstacle would be the early and complete loss of the pale-blue tint, from the necessity of reiterated crosses with the slaty female, the latter not having at first any latent tendency to produce pale-blue offspring.\nOn the other hand, if one or two males were to vary ever so slightly in paleness, and the variations were from the first limited in their transmission to the male sex, the task of making a new breed of the desired kind would be easy, for such males would simply have to be selected and matched with ordinary females. An analogous case has actually occurred, for there are breeds of the pigeon in Belgium* in which the males alone are marked with black striae. So again Mr. Tegetmeier has recently shewn*(2) that dragons not rarely produce silver-coloured birds, which are almost always hens; and he himself has bred ten such females. It is on the other hand a very unusual event when a silver male is produced; so that nothing would be easier, if desired, than to make a breed of dragons with blue males and silver females. This tendency is indeed so strong that when Mr. Tegetmeier at last got a silver male and matched him with one of the silver females, he expected to get a breed with both sexes thus coloured; he was however disappointed, for the young male reverted to the blue colour of his grandfather, the young female alone being silver. No doubt with patience this tendency to reversion in the males, reared from an occasional silver male matched with a silver hen, might be eliminated, and then both sexes would be coloured alike; and this very process has been followed with success by Mr. Esquilant in the case of silver turbits.\n* Dr. Chapius, Le Pigeon Voyageur Belge, 1865, p. 87.\n*(2) The Field, Sept., 1872.\nWith fowls, variations of colour, limited in their transmission to the male sex, habitually occur. When this form of inheritance prevails, it might well happen that some of the successive variations would be transferred to the female, who would then slightly resemble the male, as actually occurs in some breeds. Or again, the greater number, but not all, of the successive steps might be transferred to both sexes, and the female would then closely resemble the male. There can hardly be a doubt that this is the cause of the male pouter pigeon having a somewhat larger crop, and of the male carrier pigeon having somewhat larger wattles, than their respective females; for fanciers have not selected one sex more than the other, and have had no wish that these characters should be more strongly displayed in the male than in the female, yet this is the case with both breeds.\nThe same process would have to be followed, and the same difficulties encountered, if it were desired to make a breed with the females alone of some new colour.\nLastly, our fancier might wish to make a breed with the two sexes differing from each other, and both from the parent species. Here the difficulty would be extreme, unless the successive variations were from the first sexually limited on both sides, and then there would be no difficulty. We see this with the fowl; thus the two sexes of the pencilled Hamburghs differ greatly from each other, and from the two sexes of the aboriginal Gallus bankiva; and both are now kept constant to their standard of excellence by continued selection, which would be impossible unless the distinctive characters of both were limited in their transmission.\nThe Spanish fowl offers a more curious case; the male has an immense comb, but some of the successive variations, by the accumulation of which it was acquired, appear to have been transferred to the female; for she has a comb many times larger than that of the females of the parent species. But the comb of the female differs in one respect from that of the male, for it is apt to lop over; and within a recent period it has been ordered by the fancy that this should always be the case, and success has quickly followed the order. Now the lopping of the comb must be sexually limited in its transmission, otherwise it would prevent the comb of the male from being perfectly upright, which would be abhorrent to every fancier. On the other hand, the uprightness of the comb in the male must likewise be a sexually-limited character, otherwise it would prevent the comb of the female from lopping over.\nFrom the foregoing illustrations, we see that even with almost unlimited time at command, it would be an extremely difficult and complex, perhaps an impossible process, to change one form of transmission into the other through selection. Therefore, without distinct evidence in each case, I am unwilling to admit that this has been effected in natural species. On the other hand, by means of successive variations, which were from the first sexually limited in their transmission, there would not be the least difficulty in rendering a male bird widely different in colour or in any other character from the female; the latter being left unaltered, or slightly altered, or specially modified for the sake of protection.\nAs bright colours are of service to the males in their rivalry with other males, such colours would be selected whether or not they were transmitted exclusively to the same sex. Consequently the females might be expected often to partake of the brightness of the males to a greater or less degree; and this occurs with a host of species. If all the successive variations were transmitted equally to both sexes, the females would be indistinguishable from the males; and this likewise occurs with many birds. If, however, dull colours were of high importance for the safety of the female during incubation, as with many ground birds, the females which varied in brightness, or which received through inheritance from the males any marked accession of brightness, would sooner or later be destroyed. But the tendency in the males to continue for an indefinite period transmitting to their female offspring their own brightness, would have to be eliminated by a change in the form of inheritance; and this, as shewn by our previous illustration, would be extremely difficult. The more probable result of the long-continued destruction of the more brightly-coloured females, supposing the equal form of transmission to prevail would be the lessening or annihilation of the bright colours of the males, owing to their continual crossing with the duller females. It would be tedious to follow out all the other possible results; but I may remind the reader that if sexually limited variations in brightness occurred in the females, even if they were not in the least injurious to them and consequently were not eliminated, yet they would not be favoured or selected, for the male usually accepts any female, and does not select the more attractive individuals; consequently these variations would be liable to be lost, and would have little influence on the character of the race; and this will aid in accounting for the females being commonly duller-coloured than the males.\nIn the eighth chapter instances were given, to which many might here be added, of variations occurring at various ages, and inherited at the corresponding age. It was also shewn that variations which occur late in life are commonly transmitted to the same sex in which they first appear; whilst variations occurring early in life are apt to be transmitted to both sexes; not that all the cases of sexually-limited transmission can thus be accounted for. It was further shewn that if a male bird varied by becoming brighter whilst young, such variations would be of no service until the age for reproduction had arrived, and there was competition between rival males. But in the case of birds living on the ground and commonly in need of the protection of dull colours, bright tints would be far more dangerous to the young and inexperienced than to the adult males. Consequently the males which varied in brightness whilst young would suffer much destruction and be eliminated through natural selection; on the other hand, the males which varied in this manner when nearly mature, notwithstanding that they were exposed to some additional danger, might survive, and from being favoured through sexual selection, would procreate their kind. As a relation often exists between the period of variation and the form of transmission, if the bright-coloured young males were destroyed and the mature ones were successful in their courtship, the males alone would acquire brilliant colours and would transmit them exclusively to their male offspring. But I by no means wish to maintain that the influence of age on the form of transmission, is the sole cause of the great difference in brilliancy between the sexes of many birds.\nWhen the sexes of birds differ in colour, it is interesting to determine whether the males alone have been modified by sexual selection, the females having been left unchanged, or only partially and indirectly thus changed; or whether the females have been specially modified through natural selection for the sake of protection. I will therefore discuss this question at some length, even more fully than its intrinsic importance deserves; for various curious collateral points may thus be conveniently considered.\nBefore we enter on the subject of colour, more especially in reference to Mr. Wallace's conclusions, it may be useful to discuss some other sexual differences under a similar point of view. A breed of fowls formerly existed in Germany* in which the hens were furnished with spurs; they were good layers, but they so greatly disturbed their nests with their spurs that they could not be allowed to sit on their own eggs. Hence at one time it appeared to me probable that with the females of the wild Gallinaceae the development of spurs had been checked through natural selection, from the injury thus caused to their nests. This seemed all the more probable, as wing-spurs, which would not be injurious during incubation, are often as well developed in the female as in the male; though in not a few cases they are rather larger in the male. When the male is furnished with leg-spurs the female almost always exhibits rudiments of them,- the rudiment sometimes consisting of a mere scale, as in Gallus. Hence it might be argued that the females had aboriginally been furnished with well-developed spurs, but that these had subsequently been lost through disuse or natural selection. But if this view be admitted, it would have to be extended to innumerable other cases; and it implies that the female progenitors of the existing spur-bearing species were once encumbered with an injurious appendage.\n* Bechstein, Naturgeschichte Deutschlands, 1793, B. iii., 339.\nIn some few genera and species, as in Galloperdix, Acomus, and the Javan peacock (Pavo muticus), the females, as well as the males, possess well-developed leg-spurs. Are we to infer from this fact that they construct a different sort of nest from that made by their nearest allies, and not liable to be injured by their spurs; so that the spurs have not been removed? Or are we to suppose that the females of these several species especially require spurs for their defence? It is a more probable conclusion that both the presence and absence of spurs in the females result from different laws of inheritance having prevailed, independently of natural selection. With the many females in which spurs appear as rudiments, we may conclude that some few of the successive variations, through which they were developed in the males, occurred very early in life, and were consequently transferred to the females. In the other and much rarer cases, in which the females possess fully developed spurs, we may conclude that all the successive variations were transferred to them; and that they gradually acquired and inherited the habit of not disturbing their nests.\nThe vocal organs and the feathers variously modified for producing sound, as well as the proper instincts for using them, often differ in the two sexes, but are sometimes the same in both. Can such differences be accounted for by the males having acquired these organs and instincts, whilst the females have been saved from inheriting them, on account of the danger to which they would have been exposed by attracting the attention of birds or beasts of prey? This does not seem to me probable, when we think of the multitude of birds which with impunity gladden the country with their voices during the spring.* It is a safer conclusion that, as vocal and instrumental organs are of special service only to the males during their courtship, these organs were developed through sexual selection and their constant use in that sex alone- the successive variations and the effects of use having been from the first more or less limited in transmission to the male offspring.\n* Daines Barrington, however, thought it probable (Philosophical Transactions, 1773, p. 164) that few female birds sing, because the talent would have been dangerous to them during incubation. He adds, that a similar view may possibly account for the inferiority of the female to the male in plumage.\nMany analogous cases could be adduced; those for instance of the plumes on the head being generally longer in the male than in the female, sometimes of equal length in both sexes, and occasionally absent in the female,- these several cases occurring in the same group of birds. It would be difficult to account for such a difference between the sexes by the female having been benefited by possessing a slightly shorter crest than the male, and its consequent diminution or complete suppression through natural selection. But I will take a more favourable case, namely the length of the tail. The long train of the peacock would have been not only inconvenient but dangerous to the peahen during the period of incubation and whilst accompanying her young. Hence there is not the least a priori improbability in the development of her tail having been checked through natural selection. But the females of various pheasants, which apparently are exposed on their open nests to as much danger as the peahen, have tails of considerable length. The females as well as the males of the Menura superba have long tails, and they build a domed nest, which is a great anomaly in so large a bird. Naturalists have wondered how the female Menura could manage her tail during incubation; but it is now known* that she \"enters the nest head first, and then turns round with her tail sometimes over her back, but more often bent round by her side. Thus in time the tail becomes quite askew, and is a tolerable guide to the length of time the bird has been sitting.\" Both sexes of an Australian kingfisher (Tanysiptera sylvia) have the middle tail-feathers greatly lengthened, and the female makes her nest in a hole; and as I am informed by Mr. R. B. Sharpe these feathers become much crumpled during incubation.\n* Mr. Ramsay, in Proc. Zoolog. Soc., 1868, p. 50.\nIn these two latter cases the great length of the tail-feathers must be in some degree inconvenient to the female; and as in both species the tail-feathers of the female are somewhat shorter than those of the male, it might be argued that their full development had been prevented through natural selection. But if the development of the tail of the peahen had been checked only when it became inconveniently or dangerously great, she would have retained a much longer tail than she actually possesses; for her tail is not nearly so long, relatively to the size of her body, as that of many female pheasants, nor longer than that of the female turkey. It must also be borne in mind that, in accordance with this view, as soon as the tail of the peahen became dangerously long, and its development was consequently checked, she would have continually reacted on her male progeny, and thus have prevented the peacock from acquiring his present magnificent train. We may therefore infer that the length of the tail in the peacock and its shortness in the peahen are the result of the requisite variations in the male having been from the first transmitted to the male offspring alone.\nWe are led to a nearly similar conclusion with respect to the length of the tail in the various species of pheasants. In the Eared pheasant (Crossoptilon auritum) the tail is of equal length in both sexes, namely sixteen or seventeen inches; in the common pheasant it is about twenty inches long in the male and twelve in the female; in Soemmerring's pheasant, thirty-seven inches in the male and only eight in the female; and lastly in Reeve's pheasant it is sometimes actually seventy-two inches long in the male and sixteen in the female. Thus in the several species, the tail of the female differs much in length, irrespectively of that of the male; and this can be accounted for, as it seems to me, with much more probability, by the laws of inheritance,- that is by the successive variations having been from the first more or less closely limited in their transmission to the male sex than by the agency of natural selection, resulting from the length of tail being more or less injurious to the females of these several allied species.\nWe may now consider Mr. Wallace's arguments in regard to the sexual colouration of birds. He believes that the bright tints originally acquired through sexual selection by the males would in all, or almost all cases, have been transmitted to the females, unless the transference had been checked through natural selection. I may here remind the reader that various facts opposed to this view have already been given under reptiles, amphibians, fishes and lepidoptera. Mr. Wallace rests his belief chiefly, but not exclusively, as we shall see in the next chapter, on the following statement,* that when both sexes are coloured in a very conspicuous manner, the nest is of such a nature as to conceal the sitting bird; but when there is a marked contrast of colour between the sexes, the male being gay and the female dull-coloured, the nest is open and exposes the sitting bird to view. This coincidence, as far as it goes, certainly seems to favour the belief that the females which sit on open nests have been specially modified for the sake of protection; but we shall presently see that there is another and more probable explanation, namely, that conspicuous females have acquired the instinct of building domed nests oftener than dull-coloured birds. Mr. Wallace admits that there are, as might have been expected, some exceptions to his two rules, but it is a question whether the exceptions are not so numerous as seriously to invalidate them.\n* Journal of Travel, edited by A. Murray, vol. i., 1868, p. 78.\nThere is in the first place much truth in the Duke of Argyll's remark* that a large domed nest is more conspicuous to an enemy, especially to all tree-haunting carnivorous animals, than a smaller open nest. Nor must we forget that with many birds which build open nests, the male sits on the eggs and aids the female in feeding the young: this is the case, for instance, with Pyranga aestiva,*(2) one of the most splendid birds in the United States, the male being vermilion, and the female light brownish-green. Now if brilliant colours had been extremely dangerous to birds whilst sitting on their open nests, the males in these cases would have suffered greatly. It might, however, be of such paramount importance to the male to be brilliantly coloured, in order to beat his rivals, that this may have more than compensated some additional danger.\n* Journal of Travel, edited by A. Murray, vol. i., 1868, p. 281.\n*(2) Audubon, Ornithological Biography, vol. i., p. 233.\nMr. Wallace admits that with the king-crows (Dicrurus), orioles, and Pittidae, the females are conspicuously coloured, yet build open nests; but he urges that the birds of the first group are highly pugnacious and could defend themselves; that those of the second group take extreme care in concealing their open nests, but this does not invariably hold good;* and that with the birds of the third group the females are brightly coloured chiefly on the under surface. Besides these cases, pigeons which are sometimes brightly, and almost always conspicuously coloured, and which are notoriously liable to the attacks of birds of prey, offer a serious exception to the rule, for they almost always build open and exposed nests. In another large family, that of the humming-birds, all the species build open nests, yet with some of the most gorgeous species the sexes are alike; and in the majority, the females, though less brilliant than the males, are brightly coloured. Nor can it be maintained that all female humming-birds, which are brightly coloured, escape detection by their tints being green, for some display on their upper surfaces red, blue, and other colours.*(2)\n* Jerdon, Birds of India, vol. ii., p. 108. Gould's Handbook of the Birds of Australia, vol. i., p. 463.\n*(2) For instance, the female Eupetomena macroura has the head and tail dark blue with reddish loins; the female Lampornis porphyrurus is blackish-green on the upper surface, with the lores and sides of the throat crimson; the female Eulampis jugularis has the top of the head and back green, but the loins and the tail are crimson. Many other instances of highly conspicuous females could be given. See Mr. Gould's magnificent work on this family.\nIn regard to birds which build in holes or construct domed nests, other advantages, as Mr. Wallace remarks, besides concealment are gained, such as shelter from the rain, greater warmth, and in hot countries protection from the sun;* so that it is no valid objection to his view that many birds having both sexes obscurely coloured build concealed nests.*(2) The female horn-bill (Buceros), for instance, of India and Africa is protected during incubation with extraordinary care, for she plasters up with her own excrement the orifice of the hole in which she sits on her eggs, leaving only a small orifice through which the male feeds her; she is thus kept a close prisoner during the whole period of incubation;*(3) yet female horn-bills are not more conspicuously coloured than many other birds of equal size which build open nests. It is a more serious objection to Mr. Wallace's view, as is admitted by him, that in some few groups the males are brilliantly coloured and the females obscure, and yet the latter hatch their eggs in domed nests. This is the case with the Grallinae of Australia, the superb warblers (Maluridae) of the same country, the sun-birds (Nectariniae), and with several of the Australian honey-suckers or Meliphagidae.*(4)\n* Mr. Salvin noticed in Guatemala (Ibis, 1864, p. 375) that humming-birds were much more unwilling to leave their nests during very hot weather, when the sun was shining brightly, as if their eggs would be thus injured, than during cool, cloudy, or rainy weather.\n*(2) I may specify, as instances of dull-coloured birds building concealed nests, the species belonging to eight Australian genera described in Gould's Handbook of the Birds of Australia, vol. i., pp. 340, 362, 365, 383, 387, 389, 391, 414.\n*(3) Mr. C. Horne, Proc. Zoolog. Soc., 1869. p. 243.\n*(4) On the nidification and colours of these latter species, see Gould's Handbook of the Birds of Australia, vol. i., pp. 504, 527.\nIf we look to the birds of England we shall see that there is no close and general relation between the colours of the female and the nature of the nest which is constructed. About forty of our British birds (excluding those of large size which could defend themselves) build in holes in banks, rocks, or trees, or construct domed nests. If we take the colours of the female goldfinch, bullfinch, or black-bird, as a standard of the degree of conspicuousness, which is not highly dangerous to the sitting female, then out of the above forty birds the females of only twelve can be considered as conspicuous to a dangerous degree, the remaining twenty-eight being inconspicuous.* Nor is there any close relation within the same genus between a well-pronounced difference in colour between the sexes, and the nature of the nest constructed. Thus the male house sparrow (Passer domesticus) differs much from the female, the male tree-sparrow (P. montanus) hardly at all, and yet both build well-concealed nests. The two sexes of the common fly-catcher (Muscicapa grisola) can hardly be distinguished, whilst the sexes of the pied fly-catcher (M. luctuosa) differ considerably, and both species build in holes or conceal their nests. The female blackbird (Turdus merula) differs much, the female ring-ouzel (T. torquatus) differs less, and the female common thrush (T. musicus) hardly at all from their respective males; yet all build open nests. On the other hand, the not very distantly-allied water-ouzel (Cinclus aquaticus) builds a domed nest, and the sexes differ about as much as in the ring-ouzel. The black and red grouse (Tetrao tetrix and T. scoticus) build open nests in equally well-concealed spots, but in the one species the sexes differ greatly, and in the other very little.\n* I have consulted, on this subject, Macgillivray's British Birds, and though doubts may be entertained in some cases in regard to the degree of concealment of the nest, and to the degree of conspicuousness of the female, yet the following birds, which all lay their eggs in holes or in domed nests, can hardly be considered, by the above standard, as conspicuous: Passer, 2 species; Sturnus, of which the female is considerably less brilliant than the male; Cinclus; Motallica boarula (?); Erithacus (?); Fruticola, 2 sp.; Saxicola; Ruticilla, 2 sp.; Sylvia, 3 sp.; Parus, 3 sp.; Mecistura anorthura; Certhia; Sitta; Yunx; Muscicapa, 2 sp.; Hirundo, 3 sp.; and Cypselus. The females of the following 12 birds may be considered as conspicuous according to the same standard, viz., Pastor, Motacilla alba, Parus major and P. caeruleus, Upupa, Picus, 4 sp., Coracias, Alcedo, and Merops.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing objections, I cannot doubt, after reading Mr. Wallace's excellent essay, that looking to the birds of the world, a large majority of the species in which the females are conspicuously coloured (and in this case the males with rare exceptions are equally conspicuous), build concealed nests for the sake of protection. Mr. Wallace enumerates* a long series of groups in which this rule bolds good; but it will suffice here to give, as instances, the more familiar groups of kingfishers, toucans, trogons, puff-birds (Capitonidae), plantain-eaters (Musophagae, woodpeckers, and parrots. Mr. Wallace believes that in these groups, as the males gradually acquired through sexual selection their brilliant colours, these were transferred to the females and were not eliminated by natural selection, owing to the protection which they already enjoyed from their manner of nidification. According to this view, their present manner of nesting was acquired before their present colours. But it seems to me much more probable that in most cases, as the females were gradually rendered more and more brilliant from partaking of the colours of the male, they were gradually led to change their instincts (supposing that they originally built open nests), and to seek protection by building domed or concealed nests. No one who studies, for instance, Audubon's account of the differences in the nests of the same species in the northern and southern United States,*(2) will feel any great difficulty in admitting that birds, either by a change (in the strict sense of the word) of their habits, or through the natural selection of so-called spontaneous variations of instinct, might readily be led to modify their manner of nesting.\n* Journal of Travel, edited by A. Murray, vol. i., p. 78.\n*(2) See many statements in the Ornithological Biography. See also some curious observations on the nests of Italian birds by Eugenio Bettoni, in the Atti della Societa Italiana, vol. xi., 1869, p. 487.\nThis way of viewing the relation, as far as it holds good, between the bright colours of female birds and their manner of nesting, receives some support from certain cases occurring in the Sahara Desert. Here, as in most other deserts, various birds, and many other animals, have had their colours adapted in a wonderful manner to the tints of the surrounding surface. Nevertheless there are, as I am informed by the Rev. Mr. Tristram, some curious exceptions to the rule; thus the male of the Monticola cyanea is conspicuous from his bright blue colour, and the female almost equally conspicuous from her mottled brown and white plumage; both sexes of two species of Dromolaea are of a lustrous black; so that these three species are far from receiving protection from their colours, yet they are able to survive, for they have acquired the habit of taking refuge from danger in holes or crevices in the rocks.\nWith respect to the above groups in which the females are conspicuously coloured and build concealed nests, it is not necessary to suppose that each separate species had its nidifying instinct specially modified; but only that the early progenitors of each group were gradually led to build domed or concealed nests, and afterwards transmitted this instinct, together with their bright colours, to their modified descendants. As far as it can be trusted, the conclusion is interesting, that sexual selection together with equal or nearly equal inheritance by both sexes, have indirectly determined the manner of nidification of whole groups of birds.\nAccording to Mr. Wallace, even in the groups in which the females, from being protected in domed nests during incubation, have not had their bright colours eliminated through natural selection, the males often differ in a slight, and occasionally in a considerable degree from the females. This is a significant fact, for such differences in colour must be accounted for by some of the variations in the males having been from the first limited in transmission to the same sex; as it can hardly be maintained that these differences, especially when very slight, serve as a protection to the female. Thus all the species in the splendid group of the trogons build in holes; and Mr. Gould gives figures* of both sexes of twenty-five species, in all of which, with one partial exception, the sexes differ sometimes slightly, sometimes conspicuously, in colour,- the males being always finer than the females, though the latter are likewise beautiful. All the species of kingfishers build in holes, and with most of the species the sexes are equally brilliant, and thus far Mr. Wallace's rule holds good; but in some of the Australian species the colours of the females are rather less vivid than those of the male; and in one splendidly-coloured species, the sexes differ so much that they were at first thought to be specifically distinct.*(2) Mr. R. B. Sharpe, who has especially studied this group, has shewn me some American species (Ceryle) in which the breast of the male is belted with black. Again, in Carcineutes, the difference between the sexes is conspicuous: in the male the upper surface is dull-blue banded with black, the lower surface being partly fawn-coloured, and there is much red about the head; in the female the upper surface is reddish-brown banded with black, and the lower surface white with black markings It is an interesting fact, as shewing how the same peculiar style of sexual colouring often characterises allied forms, that in three species of Dacelo the male differs from the female only in the tail being dull-blue banded with black, whilst that of the female is brown with blackish bars; so that here the tail differs in colour in the two sexes in exactly the same manner as the whole upper surface in the two sexes of Carcineutes.\n* See his Monograph of the Trogonidae, 1st edition.\n*(2) Namely, Cyanalcyon. Gould's Handbook of the Birds of Australia, vol. i., p. 133; see, also, pp. 130, 136.\nWith parrots, which likewise build in holes, we find analogous cases: in most of the species, both sexes are brilliantly coloured and indistinguishable, but in not a few species the males are coloured rather more vividly than the females, or even very differently from them. Thus, besides other strongly-marked differences, the whole under surface of the male king lory (Aprosmictus scapulatus) is scarlet, whilst the throat and chest of the female is green tinged with red: in the Euphema splendida there is a similar difference, the face and wing coverts moreover of the female being of a paler blue than in the male.* In the family of the tits (Parinae), which build concealed nests, the female of our common blue tomtit (Parus caeruleus), is \"much less brightly coloured\" than the male: and in the magnificent sultan yellow tit of India the difference is greater.*(2)\n* Every gradation of difference between the sexes may be followed in the parrots of Australia. See Gould, op. cit., vol. ii., pp. 14-102.\n*(2) Macgillivray's British Birds, vol. ii., p. 433. Jerdon, Birds of India, vol. ii., p. 282.\nAgain, in the great group of the woodpeckers,* the sexes are generally nearly alike, but in the Megapicus validus all those parts of the head, neck, and breast, which are crimson in the male are pale brown in the female. As in several woodpeckers the head of the male is bright crimson, whilst that of the female is plain, it occurred to me that this colour might possibly make the female dangerously conspicuous, whenever she put her head out of the hole containing her nest, and consequently that this colour, in accordance with Mr. Wallace's belief, had been eliminated. This view is strengthened by what Malherbe states with respect to Indopicus carlotta; namely, that the young females, like the young males, have some crimson about their heads, but that this colour disappears in the adult female, whilst it is intensified in the adult male. Nevertheless the following considerations render this view extremely doubtful: the male takes a fair share in incubation,*(2) and would be thus almost equally exposed to danger; both sexes of many species have their heads of an equally bright crimson; in other species the difference between the sexes in the amount of scarlet is so slight that it can hardly make any appreciable difference in the danger incurred; and lastly, the colouring of the head in the two sexes often differs slightly in other ways.\n* All the following facts are taken from M. Malherbe's magnificent Monographie des Picidees, 1861.\n*(2) Audubon's Ornithological Biography, vol. ii., p. 75; see also the Ibis, vol. i., p. 268.\nThe cases, as yet given, of slight and graduated differences in colour between the males and females in the groups, in which as a general rule the sexes resemble each other, all relate to species which build domed or concealed nests. But similar gradations may likewise be observed in groups in which the sexes as a general rule resemble each other, but which build open nests.\nAs I have before instanced the Australian parrots, so I may here instance, without giving any details, the Australian pigeons.* It deserves especial notice that in all these cases the slight differences in plumage between the sexes are of the same general nature as the occasionally greater differences. A good illustration of this fact has already been afforded by those kingfishers in which either the tail alone or the whole upper surface of the plumage differs in the same manner in the two sexes. Similar cases may be observed with parrots and pigeons. The differences in colour between the sexes of the same species are, also, of the same general nature as the differences in colour between the distinct species of the same group. For when in a group in which the sexes are usually alike, the male differs considerably from the female, he is not coloured in a quite new style. Hence we may infer that within the same group the special colours of both sexes when they are alike, and the colours of the male, when he differs slightly or even considerably from the female, have been in most cases determined by the same general cause; this being sexual selection.\n* Gould's Handbook of the Birds of Australia, vol. ii., pp. 109-149.\nIt is not probable, as has already been remarked, that differences in colour between the sexes, when very slight, can be of service to the female as a protection. Assuming, however, that they are of service, they might be thought to be cases of transition; but we have no reason to believe that many species at any one time are undergoing change. Therefore we can hardly admit that the numerous females which differ very slightly in colour from their males are now all commencing to become obscure for the sake of protection. Even if we consider somewhat more marked sexual differences, is it probable, for instance, that the head of the female chaffinch,- the crimson on the breast of the female bullfinch,- the green of the female greenfinch,- the crest of the female golden-crested wren, have all been rendered less bright by the slow process of selection for the sake of protection? I cannot think so; and still less with the slight differences between the sexes of those birds which build concealed nests. On the other hand, the differences in colour between the sexes, whether great or small, may to a large extent be explained on the principle of the successive variations, acquired by the males through sexual selection, having been from the first more or less limited in their transmission to the females. That the degree of limitation should differ in different species of the same group will not surprise any one who has studied the laws of inheritance, for they are so complex that they appear to us in our ignorance to be capricious in their action.*\n* See remarks to this effect in Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, vol. ii., chap. xii.\nAs far as I can discover there are few large groups of birds in which all the species have both sexes alike and brilliantly coloured, but I hear from Mr. Sclater, that this appears to be the case with the Musophagae or plantain-eaters. Nor do I believe that any large group exists in which the sexes of all the species are widely dissimilar in colour: Mr. Wallace informs me that the chatterers of S. America (Cotingidae) offer one of the best instances; but with some of the species, in which the male has a splendid red breast, the female exhibits some red on her breast; and the females of other species shew traces of the green and other colours of the males. Nevertheless we have a near approach to close sexual similarity or dissimilarity throughout several groups: and this, from what has just been said of the fluctuating nature of inheritance, is a somewhat surprising circumstance. But that the same laws should largely prevail with allied animals is not surprising. The domestic fowl has produced a great number of breeds and sub-breeds, and in these the sexes generally differ in plumage; so that it has been noticed as an unusual circumstance when in certain sub-breeds they resemble each other. On the other hand, the domestic pigeon has likewise produced a vast number of distinct breeds and sub-breeds, and in these, with rare exceptions, the two sexes are identically alike.\nTherefore if other species of Gallus and Columba were domesticated and varied, it would not be rash to predict that similar rules of sexual similarity and dissimilarity, depending on the form of transmission, would hold good in both cases. In like manner the same form of transmission has generally prevailed under nature throughout the same groups, although marked exceptions to this rule occur. Thus within the same family or even genus, the sexes may be identically alike, or very different in colour. Instances have already been given in the same genus, as with sparrows, flycatchers, thrushes and grouse. In the family of pheasants the sexes of almost all the species are wonderfully dissimilar, but are quite alike in the eared pheasant or Crossoptilon auritum. In two species of Chloephaga, a genus of geese, the male cannot be distinguished from the females, except by size; whilst in two others, the sexes are so unlike that they might easily be mistaken for distinct species.*\n* The Ibis, vol. vi., 1864, p. 122.\nThe laws of inheritance can alone account for the following cases, in which the female acquires, late in life, certain characters proper to the male, and ultimately comes to resemble him more or less completely. Here protection can hardly have come into play. Mr. Blyth informs me that the females of Oriolus melanocephalus and of some allied species, when sufficiently mature to breed, differ considerably in plumage from the adult males; but after the second or third moults they differ only in their beaks having a slight greenish tinge. In the dwarf bitterns (Ardetta), according to the same authority, \"the male acquires his final livery at the first moult, the female not before the third or fourth moult; in the meanwhile she presents an intermediate garb, which is ultimately exchanged for the same livery as that of the male.\" So again the female Falco peregrinus acquires her blue plumage more slowly than the male. Mr. Swinhoe states that with one of the drongo shrikes (Dicrurus macrocercus) the male, whilst almost a nestling, moults his soft brown plumage and becomes of a uniform glossy greenish-black; but the female retains for a long time the white striae and spots on the axillary feathers; and does not completely assume the uniform black colour of the male for three years. The same excellent observer remarks that in the spring of the second year the female spoon-bill (Platalea) of China resembles the male of the first year, and that apparently it is not until the third spring that she acquires the same adult plumage as that possessed by the male at a much earlier age. The female Bombycilla carolinensis differs very little from the male, but the appendages, which like beads of red sealing-wax ornament the wing-feathers,* are not developed in her so early in life as in the male. In the male of an Indian parrakeet (Paloeornis javanicus) the upper mandible is coral-red from his earliest youth, but in the female, as Mr. Blyth has observed with caged and wild birds, it is at first black and does not become red until the bird is at least a year old, at which age the sexes resemble each other in all respects. Both sexes of the wild turkey are ultimately furnished with a tuft of bristles on the breast, but in two-year-old birds the tuft is about four inches long in the male and hardly apparent in the female; when, however, the latter has reached her fourth year, it is from four to five inches in length.*(2)\n* When the male courts the female, these ornaments are vibrated, and \"are shewn off to great advantage,\" on the outstretched wings: A. Leith Adams, Field and Forest Rambles, 1873, p. 153.\n*(2) On Ardetta, Translation of Cuvier's Regne Animal, by Mr. Blyth, footnote, p. 159.

On the Bombycilla, Audubon's Ornitholog. Biography, vol. i., p. 229. On the Palaeornis, see, also, Jerdon, Birds of India, vol. i., p. 263. On the wild turkey, Audubon, ibid., vol. i., p. 15; but I hear from Judge Caton that in Illinois the female very rarely acquires a tuft. Analogous cases with the females of Petrcocssyphus are given by Mr. R. Sharpe, Proeedings of the Zoological Society, 1872, p. 496.\nThese cases must not be confounded with those where diseased or old females abnormally assume masculine characters, nor with those where fertile females, whilst young, acquire the characters of the male, through variation or some unknown cause.* But all these cases have so much in common that they depend, according to the hypothesis of pangenesis, on gemmules derived from each part of the male being present, though latent, in the female; their development following on some slight change in the elective affinities of her constituent tissues.\n* Of these latter cases Mr. Blyth has recorded (Translation of Cuvier's Regne Animal, p. 158) various instances with Lanius, Ruticilla, Linaria, and Anas. Audubon has also recorded a similar case (Ornitholog. Biography, vol. v., p. 519) with Pyranga aestiva.\nA few words must be added on changes of plumage in relation to the season of the year. From reasons formerly assigned there can be little doubt that the elegant plumes, long pendant feathers, crests, &c., of egrets, herons, and many other birds, which are developed and retained only during the summer, serve for ornamental and nuptial purposes, though common to both sexes. The female is thus rendered more conspicuous during the period of incubation than during the winter; but such birds as herons and egrets would be able to defend themselves. As, however, plumes would probably be inconvenient and certainly of no use during the winter, it is possible that the habit of moulting twice in the year may have been gradually acquired through natural selection for the sake of casting off inconvenient ornaments during the winter. But this view cannot be extended to the many waders, whose summer and winter plumages differ very little in colour. With defenceless species, in which both sexes, or the males alone, become extremely conspicuous during the breeding-season,- or when the males acquire at this season such long wing or tail-feathers as to impede their flight, as with Cosmetornis and Vidua,- it certainly at first appears highly probable that the second moult has been gained for the special purpose of throwing off these ornaments. We must, however, remember that many birds, such as some of the birds of paradise, the Argus pheasant and peacock, do not cast their plumes during the winter; and it can hardly be maintained that the constitution of these birds, at least of the Gallinaceae, renders a double moult impossible, for the ptarmigan moults thrice in the year.* Hence it must be considered as doubtful whether the many species which moult their ornamental plumes or lose their bright colours during the winter, have acquired this habit on account of the inconvenience or danger which they would otherwise have suffered.\n* See Gould's Birds of Great Britain.\nI conclude, therefore, that the habit of moulting twice in the year was in most or all cases first acquired for some distinct purpose, perhaps for gaining a warmer winter covering; and that variations in the plumage occurring during the summer were accumulated through sexual selection, and transmitted to the offspring at the same season of the year; that such variations were inherited either by both sexes or by the males alone, according to the form of inheritance which prevailed. This appears more probable than that the species in all cases originally tended to retain their ornamental plumage during the winter, but were saved from this through natural selection, resulting from the inconvenience or danger thus caused.\nI have endeavoured in this chapter to shew that the arguments are not trustworthy in favour of the view that weapons, bright colours, and various ornaments, are now confined to the males owing to the conversion, by natural selection, of the equal transmission of characters to both sexes, into transmission to the male sex alone. It is also doubtful whether the colours of many female birds are due to the preservation, for the sake of protection, of variations which were from the first limited in their transmission to the female sex. But it will be convenient to defer any further discussion on this subject until I treat, in the following chapter, of the differences in plumage between the young and old.","id":"<urn:uuid:429cf924-5712-4f80-a526-9d8fbe64f107>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/literature.org\/authors\/darwin-charles\/the-descent-of-man\/chapter-15.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9711375237,"token_count":11677,"score":3.265625,"int_score":3}

{"text":"Guest post by Henry B. Perry\nHenry Perry, M.D., Ph.D., MPH, is a senior associate in the Department of International Health at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Md.\nDuring the past half-century, there has been a growing recognition that community-based workers can make an important contribution to the health of communities, especially in resource-constrained settings. These workers are known by many names, but most commonly Community Health Workers (CHWs). With initial training of usually 6 weeks or less, they can effectively provide different types of services from community mobilization to health education to preventive screening to family planning education to identifying persons with symptoms of leprosy or tuberculosis to diagnosis and treatment of life-threatening childhood illness, and many more. These persons may work as volunteers or for modest incentives or salaries.\nBased on early projects that utilized CHWs effectively in a number of developing countries, the seminal International Conference on Primary Health Care \u2014 sponsored by the World Health Organization and UNICEF in 1978 and attended by high-level representatives of almost every country in the world \u2014 recognized that in many settings where facilities and highly trained health workers are scarce, CHWs can become an important part of a primary health care system.\nThe Declaration of Alma Ata, adopted at the conference, called for basic health services \u2014 promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitative \u2014 to be provided by \u201chealth workers, including physicians, nurses, midwives, auxiliaries and community workers [italics added] as applicable, as well as traditional practitioners as needed, suitably trained socially and technically to work as a health team and to respond to the expressed health needs of the community.\u201d The Declaration also recognized the importance of providing health services \u201cas close as possible to where people live and work.\u201d\nA rapidly growing number of studies demonstrate that CHWs make it possible to expand access and improve coverage of essential services, particularly in remote and poorly served populations, thereby improving equity. CHWs have been shown to play critical roles in interventions to\n- reduce child mortality, including distribution of vitamin A capsules and other critical micronutrients\n- promote water and sanitation education (hand washing, point-of-use water treatment and safe water storage, latrine construction and promotion of latrine use)\n- distribute mosquito nets and assist communities in draining stagnant water to eliminate breeding grounds for mosquitoes\n- diagnose and treat childhood pneumonia, diarrhea, malaria, newborn sepsis and severe malnutrition\n- promote healthy behaviors such as appropriate breastfeeding (exclusive breastfeeding during the first six months of life and continued breastfeeding until at least one year of age)\n- provide hygiene and cleanliness education\n- ensure appropriate care of newborns\n- promote and facilitate immunizations for mothers and children.\nMany countries can benefit by scaling up integrated community case management of pneumonia, diarrhea, malaria and newborn sepsis and promotion of healthy behaviors that can save the lives of millions of children who are dying from preventable causes.\nCHWs are one of the essential ingredients for making this possible \u2014 along with political commitment, professional leadership, long-term sustainable training, support and supervision from the health system and reliable logistical support of basic medicines and supplies. A strong commitment by the world community to these activities, which are some of the most cost-effective approaches to promoting global equity in health, is a moral imperative for today and tomorrow.\nJames Grant, the renowned executive director of UNICEF from 1980 to 1995 and champion of what is often referred to as the First Child Survival Revolution, repeatedly reminded us that \u201cmorality must march with capacity.\u201d\nWe now know that CHWs can have the capacity to make a difference between life and death for millions of children. The moral imperative for the world community is to ensure that health systems and underserved communities support CHWs in attaining this capacity.\nBerman, P. A., D. R. Gwatkin, et al.

{"text":"Gay and Lesbian Issues\nThe adolescent years are full of challenges, many related to sex and sexual identity. These issues can be especially difficult for teens who are (or think they may be) homosexual. Homosexual teens deserve the same understanding and respect as heterosexual teens, and it is important for everyone to know the facts about homosexuality. Here are the basics.\nEach of us has a biological sex (we have a male or female body), a gender identity (we feel like a male or female), and a sexual orientation (we are attracted to males or females). Homosexuality refers to a person's sexual orientation; homosexual teen-agers have strong romantic or sexual feelings for a person of the same sex. Heterosexual teen-agers are attracted to people of the opposite sex, and bisexual teens are attracted to people of both sexes.\nThe word \"gay\" is used to describe both men and women who are homosexual, with the word \"lesbian\" specifically referring to a homosexual woman. It is estimated that 10 percent of the population in the United States and throughout the world is lesbian or gay.\nAlthough scientists don't know why some people are homosexual and others are not, most believe that homosexuality is a normal variation of sexual orientation. It may be genetic, result from natural substances (hormones) in the body, be influenced by the environment before or after birth, or, most likely, several of these things working in combination. Homosexual teens are found in all types of families. Homosexuality is not caused by \"bad parenting.\" If your teen is gay, it is not because of anything you or anyone else did.\nHomosexuality also is not something a person chooses, nor is it an illness that can be cured. According to the American Psychiatric Association, so-called therapies such as \"reparative therapy\" and \"transformational ministry\" don't work and actually can be harmful, causing guilt and anxiety in homosexual teens.\nNot all teen-agers who are attracted to members of the same sex are homosexual. Many teens experiment with their sexuality during adolescence, in much the same way that they experiment with clothing, body art or music. This brief sexual experimentation is thought to be a normal part of sexual development. For homosexual teens, the attraction to people of the same sex is stronger and longer lasting.\nBack to top\nEvery family is different. While one parent may find out by chance that a teen is homosexual, others may hear directly from their teen in person, in a letter or by a phone call. When a teen tells other people that he is homosexual, it's called \"coming out.\" Although this process sometimes can be difficult or painful for families, it also can be a time of tremendous growth. It is important to remember that all teens need their family's support and acceptance, especially when they are dealing with sensitive issues.\nBack to top\n\"Coming out\" can be scary and painful, and parents need to reassure their children that they will not be loved any less for sharing the truth about themselves. If your teen tells you he is gay, let him know that you love him unconditionally, and accept him no matter what.\nShow your teen that you care by learning more about homosexuality. Read books on the subject or check out reputable Web sites (such as www.pflag.org). Talk to some adults you know who are gay. Look for organizations or support groups in your community that can give you information on homosexuality. It will be easier for you to support your teen when you know more and are comfortable with the subject.\nParents may worry about how friends, neighbors and family will react to their teen's homosexuality. It is usually best not to share any information without your teen-ager's permission. Unfortunately, prejudice against homosexuals is widespread, mostly due to ignorance and fear. When your teen is ready for you to let others know, you should talk with them about your teen's sexual orientation and help them to understand, by using what you have learned.\nBack to top\nGrowing up as a homosexual in a mostly heterosexual society often is not easy. Gay and lesbian adolescents sometimes must cope with unfair, prejudiced, and even violent behavior at school, at home and in the community. They may feel fear or be alone and unsupported. This can push some teens to use drugs and alcohol, engage in risky sexual behavior, or even attempt suicide. It is important that homosexual teens feel supported by their parents and always able to talk openly with them about these issues.\nOverall, most gay and lesbian youth grow up to be well-adjusted and happy adults, with successful careers and family lives.\nBooks for parents of the newly out:\n\"Is it A Choice?

{"text":"Vedic Art: Indian Miniature Painting, Part 14\nBY: SUN STAFF\nAhmadnagar, c. 1595\nDec 26, 2011 CANADA (SUN) A serial presentation of India's artistic legacy in paintings, sculpture and temple architecture.\nTHE DECCANI SCHOOLS\n16th to 18th Centuries\nLike the group of Bikaner paintings featured in yesterday's segment, of Govinda fluting with His cows, there are many beautiful Vaisnava themes to be found among the Deccan Miniatures. Today we take a brief look at paintings from the Ahmednagar School, a sub-category of the Deccan School. In the Ahmednagar Miniatures, Vaisnava themes are overshadowed by the Persian influence, no doubt because the earliest examples of this school are no longer in existence.\nAhmednagar, Maharashtra, situated about 250 km. due east of Mumbai, was an Islamic kingdom during the Sixteenth Century. During the late Iron Age it was part of the territory of the Sattavahanas and during the 1st Millennium A.D. it was ruled by the Yadavas, until it fell to the Muslim intruders.\nRagamala, Ahmednagar, 17th c.\nNearly all the early examples of Ahmednagar painting are in the Persian style, an influence seen not only in themes, but also in the richly brilliant colors, high horizons, golden skies and landscapes, and gilt scripts framing the wide borders of manuscript illustrations. This style is equally evident in Ahmednagar School Ragamala illustrations of the period.\nIn the Ragamala illustration of Vasanta Raga above, the painting is bordered along with top with the Raga verse in Devanagari script vas (anta). Not shown is an additional caption above that, in Arabic characters, which mislabels the painting as Hindola Raga and Vasant Ragini. The raga depicted is actually the Vasanta, and it was no doubt the introduction of the swing (hindola) that led to the confusion of titles.\nThe Sanskrit verses for this Raga describe how Vasanta (the male personification of Spring, or Kamadeva) is sprayed with holi colors by young maids in a mango grove, on a Kashmiri mountain. Praised by strings of bees, he disports himself on a swing. Like a blue lotus (dark complexioned) and dressed in a tawny garment, he holds in his fingers the shoots of the fresh mango.\nIn the painting, the young male Spring wears a four-pointed coat, a fashionable style worn during the reign of Akbar. This aspect of the figure may have been adopted by the artist from a Malwa influence. The distinctive feature of the women's costumes are the projecting transparent veils, a style also found in the Nimat Namah (cookbook) of Malwa. This may tie it to the Chaurapanchasika Group of Miniatures, perhaps developed in its classical form in Malwa or south Rajasthan during the second half of the 16th Century. This detail of costume does point to the northern Deccan origin of this Vasanta Raga illustration.\nMinistry of Culture, Government of India\nSubmit an Article\nCopyright 2005, 2011, HareKrsna.com.

{"text":"By Justin Moyer\nThe Washington Post\n\u2014 Defense Secretary Leon Panetta signed an order Thursday allowing women the same opportunities as men to serve in combat, including formerly off-limits assignments on attack submarines and in the Navy SEALs. Just two weeks before the announcement, researchers from San Diego's Naval Health Research Center published a study suggesting that some recent mothers deployed on the battlefield may be more prone to depression after seeing action.\n\"Women who deploy and report combat-associated exposures after childbirth are significantly more likely to screen positive for maternal depression than are women who did not deploy after childbirth,\" concluded the study, titled \"Is Military Deployment a Risk Factor for Maternal Depression?\" and appearing in the Journal of Women's Health. \"It is also possible,\" the report noted, \"that giving birth and leaving a young child, in addition to the experience of combat, contribute to postdeployment depression.\"\nThe study included eight co-authors, five of them associated with the Naval Health Research Center, a research and development laboratory within the Department of Defense.

{"text":"Walking under the metal gate that reads \u201cArbeit Macht Frei\u201d (\u201cWork Brings Freedom\u201d) is a seminal moment for visitors to Auschwitz \u2014 a chill-inducing passage into a place of death. It comes as some surprise, then, to learn that it was actually upon passing the ticket-takers\u2019 booth in the parking lot that visitors entered what was the main complex of the concentration camp.\nThe communist government that took control of Auschwitz after the war altered the physical complex in innumerable unmarked ways, changes that were largely made to serve the story of the Holocaust told behind the Iron Curtain. In communist eastern Europe, the central narrative of the Holocaust was not the death of Jews; it was the story of communist resistance and fascist atrocity. As a result, the focus of the Auschwitz museum is the complex known as Auschwitz 1, where the bulk of Polish political prisoners were killed early in the war. In the communist incarnation of the museum, only two of the barracks in Auschwitz 1 were given over to a discussion of the Jews. That has broadened in the post-communist years, but there continues to be a very European focus on nationalism. The Dutch government was given a barrack where they tell a story of brave Dutch resistance; they do not mention that, aside from Poland, no country allowed a higher proportion of its Jews to be killed than the Netherlands.\nThe museological focus on Auschwitz 1, however, has the unintended effect of leaving the much more massive Birkenau complex \u2014 the center of mass extermination \u2014 in a relatively unadulterated state. Few spaces convey the physical enormity of Jewish death during the Holocaust like the fields of Birkenau, with the outlines of destroyed barracks stretching out over a vast desolate field. At the back of the Birkenau complex, the Soviets erected an abstract granite memorial that towers over the surroundings. It represents the Soviet story, which was always one of triumph, skipping as quickly as possible over the mourning stage. This effort to create a narrative, though, is overwhelmed by the remains of the two brick buildings nearby that held the gas chambers, now collapsing in on themselves.","id":"<urn:uuid:8cceb1a4-fe2e-4399-a86b-54e75cb6317f>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/forward.com\/articles\/3395\/auschwitz\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9683104753,"token_count":440,"score":3.171875,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Cancer debate: Are tumors fueled by stem cells?\nHow can a cancer come back after it's apparently been eradicated? Three new studies from American, Belgian, British and Dutch researchers are bolstering a long-debated idea: that tumors contain their own pool of stem cells that can multiply and keep fueling the cancer, seeding regrowth.\nIf that's true, scientists will need to find a way to kill those cells, apart from how they attack the rest of the tumor.\nStem cells in healthy tissues are known for their ability to produce any kind of cell. The new research deals with a different kind, cancer stem cells. Some researchers, but not all, believe they lurk as a persisting feature in tumors.\nOver the past decade, studies have found evidence for them in tumors like breast and colon cancers. But this research has largely depended on transplanting human cancer cells into mice that don't have immune systems, an artificial environment that raises questions about the relevance of the results.\nNow, three studies reported online Wednesday in the journals Nature and Science present evidence for cancer stem cells within the original tumors. Again, the research relies on mice. That and other factors mean the new findings still won't convince everyone that cancer stem cells are key to finding more powerful treatments.\nBut researcher Luis Parada, of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, believes his team is onto something. He says that for the type of brain tumor his team studied, \"we've identified the true enemy.\"\nIf his finding applies to other cancers, he said, then even if chemotherapy drastically shrinks a tumor but doesn't affect its supply of cancer stem cells, \"very little progress has actually been made.\"\nThe three studies used labeling techniques to trace the ancestry of cells within mouse tumors.\nCollectively, they give \"very strong support\" to the cancer stem cell theory, said Jeffrey M. Rosen, a professor of molecular and cellular biology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. He did not participate in the work but supports the theory, which he said is widely accepted.\nParada's team worked with mice genetically primed to develop a certain type of brain tumor. The scientists genetically labeled particular cells in the tumor and then attacked the cancer with the same drug given to human patients. It kills growing tumor cells and temporarily stops the cancer's growth.\nAfter treatment, when the tumor started growing again in the mice, the researchers showed that the vast majority, if not all, of its new cells had descended from the labeled cells. Apparently these were the tumor's cancer stem cells, they concluded.\nParada said his team is now trying to isolate cancer stem cells from mouse brain cancers to study them and perhaps get some leads for developing therapies to eradicate them.\nHe also said that preliminary study of human brain tumors is producing results consistent with what his team found in the mice.\nParada's study appears in Nature. In a second Nature report, British and Belgian researchers found evidence for cancer stem cells in early stage skin tumors in mice. And in the journal Science, a Dutch group found such evidence in mouse intestinal polyps, which are precursors to colon cancer.\nScott Kern of the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore is skeptical about whether tumors contain cancer stem cells. He said that since the new studies didn't involve human tumors, it's not clear how relevant they are to people.\nThe two European studies focused largely on lesions that can lead to tumors, he said. And as for Parada's brain cancer study, he said he believed the results could be explained without relying on the cancer stem cell theory.\nCopyright 2012 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Software licenses! If you've ever attempted to read one you know how true this is, but you have to know a little about software licensing even if you can't parse all of the fine print.\nBy: Chris Peters\nMarch 10, 2009\nA software license is an agreement between you and the owner of a program which lets you perform certain activities which would otherwise constitute an infringement under copyright law. The software license usually answers questions such as:\nThe price of the software and the licensing fees, if any, are sometimes discussed in the licensing agreement, but usually it's described elsewhere.\nIf you read the definitions below and you're still scratching your head, check out Categories of Free and Non-Free Software which includes a helpful diagram.\nFree vs Proprietary:\nWhen you hear the phrase \"free software\" or \"free software license,\" \"free\" is referring to your rights and permissions (\"free as in freedom\" or \"free as in free speech\"). In other words, a free software license gives you more rights than a proprietary license. You can usually copy, modify, and redistribute free software without paying a fee or obtaining permission from the developers and distributors. In most cases \"free software\" won't cost you anything, but that's not always the case \u2013 in this instance the word free is making no assertion whatsoever about the price of the software. Proprietary software puts more restrictions and limits on your legal permission to copy, modify, and distribute the program.\nFree, Open-Source or FOSS?\nIn everyday conversation, there's not much difference between \"free software,\" \"open source software,\" and \"FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software).\" In other words, you'll hear these terms used interchangeably, and the proponents of free software and the supporters of open-source software agree with one another on most issues. However, the official definition of free software differs somewhat from the official definition of open-source software, and the philosophies underlying those definitions differ as well. For a short description of the difference, read Live and Let License. For a longer discussion from the \"free software\" side, read Why Open Source Misses the Point of Free Software. For the \"open-source\" perspective, read Why Free Software is Too Ambiguous.\nPublic domain and copyleft.\nThese terms refer to different categories of free, unrestricted licensing. A copyleft license allows you all the freedoms of a free software license, but adds one restriction. Under a copyleft license, you have to release any modifications under the same terms as the original software. In effect, this blocks companies and developers who want to alter free software and then make their altered version proprietary. In practice, almost all free and open-source software is also copylefted. However, technically you can release \"free software\" that isn't copylefted. For example, if you developed software and released it under a \"public domain\" license, it would qualify as free software, but it isn't copyleft. In effect, when you release something into the public domain, you give up all copyrights and rights of ownership.\nShareware and freeware.\nThese terms don't really refer to licensing, and they're confusing in light of the discussion of free software above. Freeware refers to software (usually small utilities at sites such as Tucows.com) that you can download and install without paying. However, you don't have the right to view the source code, and you may not have the right to copy and redistribute the software. In other words, freeware is proprietary software. Shareware is even more restrictive. In effect, shareware is trial software. You can use it for a limited amount of time (usually 30 or 60 days) and then you're expected to pay to continue using it.\nEnd User Licensing Agreement (EULA).\nWhen you acquire software yourself, directly from a vendor or retailer, or directly from the vendor's Web site, you usually have to indicate by clicking a box that you accept the licensing terms. This \"click-through\" agreement that no one ever reads is commonly known as a EULA. If you negotiate a large purchase of software with a company, and you sign a contract to seal the agreement, that contract usually replaces or supersedes the EULA.\nMost major vendors of proprietary software offer some type of bulk purchasing and volume licensing mechanism. The terms vary widely, but if you order enough software to qualify, the benefits in terms of cost and convenience are significant. Also, not-for-profits sometimes qualify for it with very small initial purchases.\nSome of the benefits of volume licensing include:\nLower cost. As with most products, software costs less when you buy more of it.\nEase of installation. Without volume licenses, you usually have to enter a separate activation code (also known as a product key or license key) for each installed copy of the program. On the other hand, volume licenses provide you with a single, organisation-wide activation code, which makes it much easier to find when you need to reinstall the software.\nEasier tracking of licenses. Keeping track of how many licenses you own, and how many copies you've actually installed, is a tedious, difficult task. Many volume licensing programs provide an online account which is automatically updated when you obtain or activate a copy of that company's software. These accounts can also coordinate licensing across multiple offices within your organisation.\nTo learn more about volume licensing from a particular vendor, check out some of the resources below:\nQualified not-for-profits and libraries can receive donated volume licenses for Microsoft products through TechSoup. For more information, check out our introduction to the Microsoft Software Donation Program, and the Microsoft Software Donation Program FAQ. For general information about the volume licensing of Microsoft software, see Volume Licensing Overview.\nIf you get Microsoft software from TechSoup or other software distributors who work with not-for-profits, you may need to go to the eOpen Web site to locate your Volume license keys. For more information, check out the TechSoup Donation Recipient's Guide to the Microsoft eOpen Web Site.\nAlways check TechSoup Stock first to see if there's a volume licensing donation program for the software you're interested in. If TechSoup doesn't offer that product or if you need more copies than you can find at TechSoup, search for \"volume licensing not-for-profits software\" or just \"not-for-profits software.\" For example, when we have an inventory of Adobe products, qualifying and eligible not-for-profits can obtain four individual products or one copy of Creative Suite 4 through TechSoup. If we're out of stock, or you've used up your annual Adobe donation, you can also check TechSoup's special Adobe donation program and also Adobe Solutions for Nonprofits for other discounts available to not-for-profits. For more software-hunting tips, see A Quick Guide to Discounted Software Programs.\nPay close attention to the options and licensing requirements when you acquire server-based software. You might need two different types of license \u2013 one for the server software itself, and a set of licenses for all the \"clients\" accessing the software. Depending on the vendor and the licensing scenario, \"client\" can refer either to the end users themselves (for example, employees, contractors, clients, and anyone else who uses the software in question) or their computing devices (for example, laptops, desktop computers, smartphones, PDAs, etc.). We'll focus on Microsoft server products, but similar issues can arise with other server applications.\nOver the years, Microsoft has released hundreds of server-based applications, and the licensing terms are slightly different for each one. Fortunately, there are common license types and licensing structures across different products. In other words, while a User CAL (Client Access License) for Windows Server is distinct from a User CAL for SharePoint Server, the underlying terms and rights are very similar. The TechSoup product pages for Microsoft software do a good job of describing the differences between products, so we'll focus on the common threads in this article.\nMoreover, Microsoft often lets you license a single server application in more than one way, depending on the needs of your organisation. This allows you the flexibility to choose the licenses that best reflect your organisation's usage patterns and thereby cost you the least amount of money. For example, for Windows Server and other products you can acquire licenses on a per-user basis (for example, User CALs) or per-device basis (for example, Device CALs).\nThe license required to install and run most server applications usually comes bundled with the software itself. So you can install and run most applications \"out of the box,\" as long as you have the right number of client licenses (see the section below for more on that). However, when you're running certain server products on a computer with multiple processors, you may need to get additional licenses. For example, if you run Windows Server 2008 DataCenter edition on a server with two processors, you need a separate license for each processor. SQL Server 2008 works the same way. This type of license is referred to as a processor license. Generally you don't need client licenses for any application that's licensed this way.\nClient Licenses for Internal Users\nMany Microsoft products, including Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008, require client access licenses for all authenticated internal users (for example, employees, contractors, volunteers, etc.). On the other hand, SQL Server 2008 and other products don't require any client licenses. Read the product description at CTXchange if you're looking for the details about licensing a particular application.\nUser CALs: User CALs allow each user access to all the instances of a particular server product in an organisation, no matter which device they use to gain access. In other words, if you run five copies of Windows Server 2008 on five separate servers, you only need one User CAL for each person in your organisation who access those servers (or any software installed on those servers), whether they access a single server, all five servers, or some number in between. Each user with a single CAL assigned to them can access the server software from as many devices as they want (for example, desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, etc.). User CALs are a popular licensing option.\nDevice CALs: Device CALs allow access to all instances of a particular server application from a single device (for example, a desktop computer, a laptop, etc.) in your organisation. Device CALs only make sense when multiple employees use the same computer. For example, in 24-hour call centres different employees on different shifts often use the same machine, so Device CALs make sense in this situation.\nChoosing a licensing mode for your Windows Server CALs: With Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008, you use a CAL (either a User CAL or a Device CAL) in one of two licensing modes: per seat or per server. You make this decision when you're installing your Windows Server products, not when you acquire the CALs. The CALs themselves don't have any mode designation, so you can use either a User CAL or a Device CAL in either mode. Per seat mode is the default mode, and the one used most frequently. The description of User CALs and Device CALs above describes the typical per seat mode. In \"per server\" mode, Windows treats each license as a \"simultaneous connection.\" In other words, if you have 40 CALs, Windows will let 40 authenticated users have access. The 41st user will be denied access. However, in per server mode, each CAL is tied to a particular instance of Windows Server, and you have to acquire a new set of licenses for each new server you build that runs Windows. Therefore, per server mode works for some small organisations with one or two servers and limited access requirements.\nYou don't \"install\" client licenses the way you install software. There are ways to automate the tracking of software licenses indirectly, but the server software can't refuse access to a user or device on licensing grounds. The licenses don't leave any \"digital footprint\" that the server software can read. An exception to this occurs when you license Windows Server in per server mode. In this case, if you have 50 licenses, the 51st authenticated user will be denied access (though anonymous users can still access services).\nSome key points to remember about client licensing:\nThe licensing scenarios described in this section arise less frequently, and are too complex to cover completely in this article, so they're described briefly below along with more comprehensive resources.\nYou don't need client licenses for anonymous, unauthenticated external users. In other words, if someone accesses your Web site, and that site runs on Internet Information Server (IIS), Microsoft's Web serving software, you don't need a client license for any of those anonymous users.\nIf you have any authenticated external users who access services on your Windows-based servers, you can obtain CALs to cover their licensing requirements. However, the External Connector License (ECL) is a second option in this scenario. The ECL covers all use by authenticated external users, but it's a lot more expensive than a CAL, so only get one if you'll have a lot of external users. For example, even if you get your licenses through the CTXchange donation program, an ECL for Windows Server 2008 has an \u00a376 administrative fee, while a User CAL for Windows Server 2008 carries a \u00a31 admin fee. If only a handful of external users access your Windows servers, you're better off acquiring User CALs. Also, an ECL only applies to external users and devices. In other words, if you have an ECL, you still have to get a CAL for all employees and contractors.\nEven though Terminal Services (TS) is built into Windows Server 2003 and 2008, you need to get a separate TS CAL for each client (i.e. each user or each device) that will access Terminal Services in your organisation. This TS license is in addition to your Windows Server CALs.\nMicrosoft's System Centre products (a line of enterprise-level administrative software packages) use a special type of license known as a management license (ML). Applications that use this type of licensing include System Center Configuration Manager 2007 and System Center Operations Manager 2007. Any desktop or workstation managed by one of these applications needs a client management license. Any server managed by one of these applications requires a server management license, and there are two types of server management licenses \u2013 standard and enterprise. You need one or the other but not both. There are also special licensing requirements if you're managing virtual instances of Windows operating systems. For more information, see TechSoup's Guide to System Center Products and Licensing and Microsoft's white paper on Systems Center licensing.\nSome Microsoft server products have two client licensing modes, standard and enterprise. As you might imagine, an Enterprise CAL grants access to more advanced features of a product. Furthermore, with some products, such as Microsoft Exchange, the licenses are additive. In other words, a user needs both a Standard CAL AND an Enterprise CAL in order to access the advanced features. See Exchange Server 2007 Editions and Client Access Licenses for more information.\nWith virtualisation technologies, multiple operating systems can run simultaneously on a single physical server. Every time you install a Microsoft application, whether on a physical hardware system or a virtual hardware system, you create an \"instance\" of that application. The number of \"instances\" of particular application that you can run using a single license varies from product to product. For more information see the Volume Licensing Briefs, Microsoft Licensing for Virtualization and the Windows Server Virtualization Calculator. For TechSoup Stock products, see the product description for more information.\nThere are a lot of nuances to Microsoft licensing, and also a lot of excellent resources to help you understand different scenarios.\nAbout the Author:\nChris is a former technology writer and technology analyst for TechSoup for Libraries, which aims to provide IT management guidance to libraries.

{"text":"My Beef With Meat\nIf it has a face, it probably gobbles up global resources along with its grass\nBy Stett Holbrook\nLast month, the federal government released a much-anticipated report on global climate change. It paints a chilling picture of what will happen if global warming continues unabated. \"This report is a game-changer,\" said the new director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Jane Lubchenco, at a press conference last week. \"I think that much of the foot-dragging in addressing climate change is a reflection of the perception that climate change is way down the road, it's in the future and it only affects certain parts of the country. This report demonstrates in concrete scientific information that climate change is happening now, and it's happening in our back yards.\"\nThe report, issued by the U.S. Global Change Research Program, compiles work from 13 different government agencies. In a refreshing break from the science-averse Bush administration, the report states unequivocally that climate change is human caused. The report details changes scientists are already seeing and predicts how the climate will change if greenhouse-gas emissions aren't curtailed. The report also discusses how decisive policies can roll back the impending doom. (Read the report at globalchange.gov.) Here are two of the key findings:\n\u2022 Climate changes are under way in the United States and are projected to grow. These include increases in heavy downpours, rising temperature and sea level, rapidly retreating glaciers, thawing permafrost, lengthening growing seasons, lengthening ice-free seasons in the ocean and on lakes and rivers, earlier snowmelt and alterations in river flows.\n\u2022 Agriculture is considered one of the sectors most adaptable to changes in climate, but increased heat, pests, water stress, diseases and weather extremes will pose adaptation challenges for crop and livestock production.\nThere have been many reports on global warming and dire predictions from respected scientists. So far not much has changed. I hope that President Obama uses the power of his position to spur the dramatic and speedy action needed to reduce the profound impacts of the crisis. The challenge Obama faces is convincing people that the time to change our ways is today, not tomorrow. The trouble is, we don't usually realize we're in trouble until the roof starts caving in. For example, only when we faced global financial meltdown did world leaders act. A global recession is real and painful, but compared to the apocalyptic effects of unchecked global warming, it's but a pinprick.\nWhat does all this have to do with food? Well, while the U.S. government appears to be finally getting serious about acting against global warming, we the people need to do as much as we can. Food strikes me as particularly target-rich as we seek to reduce global warming. I see reducing our consumption of meat as the single most important action we can take as individuals. I've come to view a double bacon cheeseburger as the culinary equivalent of dumping dirty motor oil into a clear mountain lake. If eating burgers was only detrimental to those who eat them that would be one thing, but the production of meat and dairy across the world is an environmental catastrophe.\nI'm a firm believer in spending more for quality, food included. But eating well shouldn't be prohibitively expensive. I guess it's all in how one defines \"eating well.\" For me, that means little or no processed food and plenty of fresh produce in season. Food is of course a necessary expense, but there's a lot of discretion on how to spend your food dollar. But the ironic thing about food when you buy fresh, unprocessed ingredients and cook for yourself rather than opening a can or box, eating well generally costs less. At least that's my belief.\nAccording to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), livestock production generates nearly a fifth of the world's greenhouse gases, more than transportation. Animal agriculture is the leading source of methane and nitrous oxide emissions, which--combined with carbon dioxide--are the primary causes of global warming. Livestock production accounts for more than 8 percent of global human water use, the FAO says. Evidence suggests that it is also the largest source of water pollution thanks to animal wastes, antibiotics, hormones, fertilizers and pesticides used for feed crops, and sediments from eroded pastures. An estimated 30 percent of the Earth's ice-free land is involved in livestock production. Approximately 70 percent of previously forested land in the Amazon is used as pasture, and feed crops cover a large part of what's left.\nEating organically raised, grass-feed beef is a far better option than the factory-farmed garbage that most of us eat. But organically raised or not, livestock still sucks up scarce natural resources and contributes to global warming. I'm not saying we should give up meat entirely. Just eat less of it. Given the severity of the climate crisis, reducing our consumption of meat is a painless step everyone can take. What if President Obama declared he was willing to go without meat a few days a week for the sake of the planet? I'm not holding my breath for that one, but more often than not I'm going to hold off on eating meat.\nSend a letter to the editor about this story.","id":"<urn:uuid:3c0c98ac-e4c9-4bfb-9570-c1be0ef28106>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.metcruz.com\/bohemian\/07.08.09\/eats-0927.html","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9550318122,"token_count":1090,"score":2.828125,"int_score":3}

{"text":"\u201cUtopian\u201d has almost become a put-down or a suggestion that one is being unrealistic, if not naive. But I would argue that socialists must be utopian, not in the sense of expecting fundamental change instantaneously, but in the sense of holding in their very being the deep desire for the realization of a world completely unlike our own. It is that for which generations have fought and it is that ideal that has kept many a freedom fighter going despite tremendous adversities.\nWhat is especially interesting about the history of capitalism is that with its rise there also emerged the impulse towards alternatives. These alternatives were not necessarily elaborated as eloquently as were the theories behind capitalism and, specifically, democratic capitalism, but they were nevertheless important. The oppressive and often criminal nature of rising capitalism brought with it revolutionary movements that challenged either the system itself or components of the system. These revolts took various forms, such as the slave revolts that spanned the entire period of the African slave trade.\nPeter Linebaugh\u2019s The Many-Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic offers a glimpse into the world of the North Atlantic and the development of capitalism. It was a world of significant resistance carried out by men and women; slaves and the free; mutinies and worker conspiracies. And in most cases there was a deep desire, sometimes elaborated, toward a not-always-defined freedom from the exploitation and oppression that accompanies capitalism.\nWith this as a backdrop, one can see that the desire for a utopia has always been a component of progressive and revolutionary anti-capitalism. Utopia was not simply a dream, but it represented the ideological and spiritual outlines of the ideal alternative. It became something for which movements fought. For many, that utopia took the name \u201csocialism.\u201d\nIn the 19th century, there were two diametrically opposed approaches to the question of socialism. On the one hand, there were the formations of local communities based on ideal socialist principles, such as equality and shared work. These were generally referenced as examples of \u201cutopian socialism.\u201d These communities attempted to live side-by-side with capitalism, hoping to demonstrate a viable alternative. Yet in their failure to tackle the system itself, these communities were strangled by the ever-growing amoral beast of capitalism.\nIn contrast, there were revolutionary movements, initially based in Europe, that sought to gain power for workers through struggle. Karl Marx and Frederick Engels were only two of those associated with this approach. These movements also co-existed (and usually not very well) with revolutionary anarchists who envisioned the immediate end of not only capitalism, but any governmental\/state system.\nIt was also during the 19th century that the first great experiment in the creation of a worker\u2019s state took place during the short-lived Paris Commune of 1871. This urban uprising of the dispossessed shook the world and suggested that worker power was more than a slogan.\nThe 20th century was the moment for the great socialist experiments, beginning with the Russian\/Soviet Revolution in October 1917, and continuing on with China, Vietnam, Cuba and numerous other locales. Time and space do not permit anything approaching an exhaustive look at the twists and turns of the socialist experiments of the last century and the many conclusions that we could draw. For the purposes of this essay, let us say that revolutionary transformation proved to be far more difficult than the overthrow of a particular state structure.\nAmong other things, capitalism is not simply about a ruling class of capitalists, but about toxic practices, many of them day-to-day, which people have learned over generations and, as the great Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci would say, have come to be accepted as \u201ccommon sense.\u201d These practices and expectations operate like the ghostly hands of demons in a graveyard reaching out and placing often unexpected constraints on the ability to break free of such haunted spaces.\nWe also discovered that socialism was about far more than economics. It must be about the expansion of democracy and the actual control over the lives of working people by the workers themselves. This means that there will be mistakes, setbacks, and detours. But the people themselves need to take these on, since there is no omnipotent individual or organization that can ensure success in a process that knows no guarantees.\nSocialism, then, is not a utopia but a step in a process that takes us in the direction of an idea- that is, a society free of all exploitation and oppression, and with the elimination of all oppressing and oppressed classes. For me, it is summarized not in the text of a great socialist treatise, but, ironically perhaps, in the words of a fictional character, Captain Jean Luc Picard of the starship Enterprise, in the film Star Trek: First Contact. In explaining to someone from the 21st century the economics of the 24th century, he says, \u201cThe acquisition of wealth is no longer the driving force in our lives. We work to better ourselves\u2026and the rest of humanity.\u201d\nSuch an era, however, is a very long way off, and humanity will have to earn admission to that new historical epoch through the trials and tribulations associated with transforming the way that we live our lives and the way that we treat the planet.\nEach day we must struggle to get one step closer.\nThis post is also available in: Spanish","id":"<urn:uuid:ff332c0e-86bd-4089-a859-a5b5f69a5240>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/freedomroad.org\/askasocialist\/2011\/12\/is-socialism-utopian\/","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9730058312,"token_count":1119,"score":2.96875,"int_score":3}
{"text":"Locust Care Sheet\nLocust are probably the largest type of insect that you will use as livefood. Adults measure up to 8cm and are a yellow colour with darker brown\/purple patches. They are popular for their large gut content which means they are highly nutritious feeders but are somewhat expensive compared to other foptions.\nThe Locust is a fascinating insect. They are quite pleasant to have around and will not try to bite like a cricket would. Locust are often portrayed as a swarm insect that destroys crops and eats everything in their path. In fact, they are lower down the pecking order than crickets so the two should never be mixed, unless the aim is to feed the crickets. However, they do eat a lot and grow fairly quickly.\nOnly adult locust have wings that are able to give them flight. All locust have wings but only at the 5th and final moult a locust develops flying wings and are capable of flight over short distances.\nLocust have amazing claws they can hold onto and climb just about anything including glass. They tend to hang upside down while shedding so their good grip comes is readily employed.\n Housing and Heating\nHousing locust is just like housing crickets, you will want to put them in the biggest tub you can find (of course glass is fine), as long as it is sufficiently deep to deter any would-be escapees. Ventilation is important to locust so make sure the lid is perforated with holes, you can do this with a drill or a soldering iron. As locust prefer to perch a substrate really is not necessary, so a simple stack of egg crates does the trick and also provides hiding places. For water, provide a dish of damp kitchen roll, this prevents drowning and is easily changed when it gets dirty.\nWhen it comes to cleaning time after a week or two, there are several options. You are probably best lifting out the hides slowly and transferring them to another tub while working around the rest of the locust while cleaning the tub. Shake the locust off the egg crates and throw them away, swap them with clean ones and you have a nice clean tub of locust. Alternatively you can use all the locust then throw the whole lot away before purchasing a fresh batch.\nAs for temperature, locusts like a temperature of 25-33\u00c2\u00b0C (77-91.4\u00c2\u00b0F) and a dry atmosphere which will prevent fungal infections.\n Feeding Locust\nFeeding is very similar to crickets. They need to be provided with a good supply of dry foods, \"bug grub\" is an insect feeder that has a mixture of ingredients designed to be fed to insects so that they have a good gut content and provide ample nutrients to your pets. Alternative foods can be used such as bran, weetabix, digestives and bread. Fruits such as grapes, apples or vegetables such as potatoes, tomatoes and cabbage provide extra vitamins and moisture. If moist foods are available on a regular basis then a water dish is not really needed.\n Breeding Locust\nTemperature and humidity are important in breeding. Eggs are laid in a 4 inch deep dish filled with silver or sharp sand so prepare a tub as such. The sand should be kept moist but not too wet so it looks soggy.\nThe female locust will position herself over the sand dish and push her down and deposit up to 200 eggs. Hoppers will emerge after 10 - 12 days. The hoppers will go through 5 instar molting before becoming adult locust.","id":"<urn:uuid:59b9b3d9-21e1-4f3e-bdc7-6543a7bc99b8>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.care-sheet.com\/index\/Locust_Care_Sheet","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9639157057,"token_count":739,"score":2.671875,"int_score":3}
{"text":"A tracheostomy (TRA-ke-OS-to-me) is a surgically made hole that goes through the front of your neck and into your trachea (TRA-ke-ah), or windpipe. The hole is made to help you breathe.\nA tracheostomy usually is temporary, although you can have one long term or even permanently. How long you have a tracheostomy depends on the condition that required you to get it and your overall health.\nTo understand how a tracheostomy works, it helps to understand how your airways work. The airways carry oxygen-rich air to your lungs. They also carry carbon dioxide, a waste gas, out of your lungs.\nThe airways include your:\nAir enters your body through your nose or mouth. The air travels through your voice box and down your windpipe. The windpipe splits into two bronchi that enter your lungs. (For more information, go to the Health Topics How the Lungs Work article.)\nA tracheostomy provides another way for oxygen-rich air to reach your lungs, besides going through your nose or mouth. A breathing tube, also called a trach (trake) tube, is put through the tracheostomy and directly into the windpipe to help you breathe.\nDoctors use tracheostomies for many reasons. One common reason is to help people who need to be on ventilators (VEN-til-a-tors) for more than a couple of weeks.\nVentilators are machines that support breathing. If you have a tracheostomy, the trach tube connects to the ventilator.\nPeople who have conditions that interfere with coughing or block the upper airways also may need tracheostomies. Coughing is a natural reflex that protects the lungs. It helps clear mucus (a slimy substance) and bacteria from the airways. A trach tube can be used to help remove, or suction, mucus from the airways.\nDoctors also might recommend tracheostomies for people who have swallowing problems due to strokes or other conditions.\nCreating a tracheostomy is a fairly common, simple procedure. It's one of the most common procedures for critical care patients in hospitals.\nThe windpipe is located almost directly under the skin of the neck. So, a surgeon often can create a tracheostomy quickly and easily.\nThe procedure usually is done in a hospital operating room. However, it also can be safely done at a patient's bedside. Less often, a doctor or emergency medical technician may do the procedure in a life-threatening situation, such as at the scene of an accident or other emergency.\nAs with any surgery, complications can occur, such as bleeding, infection, and other serious problems. The risks often can be reduced with proper care and handling of the tracheostomy and the tubes and other related supplies.\nSome people continue to need tracheostomies even after they leave the hospital. Hospital staff will teach patients and their families or caregivers how to properly care for their tracheostomies at home.\nThe NHLBI updates Health Topics articles on a biennial cycle based on a thorough review of research findings and new literature.

Lepidophyma is the most speciose (~17 species), whereas Cricosaura is monotypic. Xantusiids have a reasonably good fossil record extending from the mid-Paleocene onward in western North America.\nXantusiids are fascinating lizards for several reasons. First, although they are almost uniformly diminuitive (Xantusia magdalena measures less than 4 cm snout-vent length, and the largest xantusiid species measure about 10 cm snout-vent length), xantusiids generally take several years to reach sexual maturity, and several species give birth to just 1 or 2 offspring. It is a more usual reproductive strategy for small lizards to mature quickly and produce large numbers of offspring, to increase their chances of survival. Despite this low reproductive potential, xantusiid neonates actually have a high life expectancy; this can be attributed at least in part to their secretive lifestyle, which leads to the second reason why xantusiids are particularly interesting -- microhabitat specialization.\nMicrohabitat specialization is an ecological hallmark of Xantusiidae. Many populations are narrowly restricted to specific niches -- crevices (e.g., Xantusia henshawi in exfoliating granitic cap rocks), interstices in agaves and yuccas in dry climates (e.g., X. magdalena), decaying logs in wet climates (e.g., Lepidophyma flavimaculatum) -- and individuals may be found under the same patch of cover throughout their lives!\nThese microhabitat restrictions result in extremely disjunct geographical distributions, and also may be responsible for some morphological convergence within the group (e.g., flattened skulls for crevice dwelling). Xantusiidae also includes two insular endemics: the Cuban Cricosaura typica is the only xantusiid found in the West Indies and is interpreted as one of the Caribbean's few ancient endemic vertebrate lineages; and Xantusia riversiana (formerly Klauberina riversiana) is limited to three of the Channel Islands off the coast of California.\nThe phylogenetic relationships of Xantusiidae are problematic. Morphology and molecules produce different topologies within the clade: morphology recovers a Cricosaura + Lepidophyma clade, while mitochondrial genes recover a Lepidophyma + Xantusia clade. Lack of resolution of relationships within Xantusiidae has hindered the placement of this clade within the squamate tree. Xantusiidae is a \"tree-changing\" taxon: it causes homoplasy wherever it is placed, and its placement can tip the balance between the two primary competing hypotheses of scleroglossan relationships. Xantusiidae is traditionally placed within Scincomorpha, but some analyses have placed it near Gekkota. Thus, Xantusiidae is either a highly derived, or extremely basal, scleroglossan clade. Previous analyses of squamate phylogeny have almost certainly suffered in relying on species of the readily available -- but relatively derived -- genus Xantusia as exemplars for Xantusiidae. Cricosaura or a species of Lepidophyma would be more appropriate, but both are exceedingly rare in collections; indeed, some species of Lepidophyma are known from only 1 or 2 specimens.\nWhatever the placement of Xantusiidae within squamates, there is no doubt that xantusiids are monophyletic. The following are some of the hypothesized synapomorphies of the lineage (from Estes et al., 1988), most of which can be seen in the skull reconstructions above: supratemporal fenestra closed primarily by postorbital; parietals paired well into postembryonic ontogeny; parietal table extensive posteriorly, largely obscuring braincase in dorsal view, supratemporal process short; vomers fused; ectopterygoid contacts palatine anterolaterally, excluding maxilla from suborbital fenestra; ectopterygoid enlarged medially, restricting suborbital fenestra.\nAbout the Species\nThis specimen was collected in Baja California Sur, Mexico. It was made available to the University of Texas High-Resolution X-ray CT Facility for scanning by Dr. Jessie Maisano of The University of Texas and Dr. Jacques Gauthier of Yale University. Funding for scanning was provided by an NSF grant (DEB-0132227) to Dr. Jack Sites of Brigham Young University. Funding for image processing was provided by a National Science Foundation Digital Libraries Initiative grant to Dr. Timothy Rowe of The University of Texas at Austin.\nAbout this Specimen\nThe specimen was scanned by Matthew Colbert on 18 May 2005 along the coronal axis for a total of 615 1024x1024 pixel slices. Each slice is 0.0152 mm thick, with an interslice spacing of 0.0152 mm and a field of reconstruction of 7 mm.\nBezy, R. L. 1982. Xantusia vigilis.

{"text":"Now, it is common knowledge these days that Hitler's final great offensive in the last years of WWII was the Ardennes Offensive of 1944\/45, also known as the battle of the Bulge. What was not appreciated at the time by the Allied high command was just how desperately short of vital supplies the Third Reich armies actually were. The Ardennes Offensive was Hitler's bold attempt to capture and hold the Allied army's massive supply of Brussels sprouts, vital - of course - for the full functioning of any army.\nGerman intelligence were aware that the American army was - in particular - massing huge quantities of the vital Brussels sprouts just behind their frontlines in preparedness for their own massive push - and - of course - in time for Christmas.\nThe German's audacious plan would have succeeded if the Allies had not quickly worked out that it was their stockpiles of Brussels sprouts that were under immediate threat. The bold plan put forward by the Allied Generals was a heavy gamble, but it paid off. They ordered their front-line chefs to begin boiling their entire stocks of Brussels sprouts, and - most importantly - to keep them boiling well past a state of fully preparedness.\nSo, when the weather altered and the wind direction changed, it blew the smell of over-cooked Brussels sprouts straight into the faces of the advancing Germans. Then the Reich troops knew that they would not be able to replenish their stocks of Brussels sprouts and any sprouts that they did capture from the Allied frontline kitchens would be overcooked to the point of inedibility.\nLater in this series, we will discuss the major strategic role that Brussels sprouts have played in world history, such as Hadrian building a wall to protect the Roman Empire's most northern supplies of Brussels sprouts from the northern barbarians, thus thwarting the barbarian's fiendish plan to deep-fry the Roman's entire stockpiles of sprouts.\nThen there was, also, Napoleon's retreat from Moscow when his over-long supply line of Brussels sprouts direct from France broke down. Even when his troops could get sprouts, they were of poor quality - dry, wizened and frozen solid. Of course, this led to a massive collapse of morale. Eventually, the lack of good quality sprouts forced a massive retreat where thousands of French troops died from a pitiful lack of sprouts.\nAnd, of course, not forgetting - of course - how the Spanish conquest of the Americas was a result of the Spaniards overwhelming sprout superiority.","id":"<urn:uuid:1e42f564-b487-459a-9400-a0404ff31bff>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/www.abctales.com\/story\/hadley\/brussels-sprouts-and-their-role-history","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368696381249\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9742326736,"token_count":518,"score":2.859375,"int_score":3}

{"text":"By Dr. Mercola\nJunk food is contributing to skyrocketing rates of diabetes, high blood pressure, and even strokes -- and not just among adults.\nFood and beverage companies spend $2 billion a year promoting unhealthy foods to kids, and while ultimately it's the parents' responsibility to feed their children healthy foods, junk food ads make this much more difficult than it should be.\nA new campaign, We're Not Buying It, is now underway to help expose deceptive marketing to children, debunk industry claims, and highlight the latest research, in the hopes of ending this assault on today's youth, and I'll explain how you can get involved, too, below.\nDoes Your Child Recognize the \"Golden Arches\"?\nMost toddlers recognize the sign of McDonald's \"golden arches\" long before they are speaking in full sentences.\nBecause they are often raised on French fries, fast-food hamburgers and orange soda, or if \"raised\" is a bit of a stretch, are taught that French fries, chicken fingers and soda is an acceptable meal. Have you noticed that even in \"regular\" restaurants the kids' menu options are almost always entirely junk food like pizza, macaroni and cheese or fried chicken strips?\nOf course kids will probably prefer these foods if that's what they're offered; these foods are manufactured to taste good, and most kids aren't going to opt for a spear of broccoli over a French fry -- until they're old enough to understand the implications of the choice, and assuming you have taught them about the importance of eating healthy foods along the way.\nIn many ways society is set up against you on this one. As The Interagency Working Group on Foods Marketed to Children (IWG) reports:\n- The fast-food industry spends more than $5 million every day marketing unhealthy foods to children.\n- Kids watch an average of over 10 food-related ads every day (nearly 4,000\/year).\n- Nearly all (98 percent) of food advertisements viewed by children are for products that are high in fat, sugar or sodium. Most (79 percent) are low in fiber.\nSo even under the best circumstances, your kids will probably be exposed to the latest \"cool\" kid foods, and this is what marketers are banking on. Then, when you go to the grocery store, your child will have a meltdown if you don't give in and buy the cereal with their favorite cartoon character on the box, or the cookies with brightly colored chips. If you're a parent, it's certainly easier to just give in, but it's imperative to be strong as shaping your child's eating habits starts very early on \u2026\nYour Child's Taste Preferences are Created by Age 3\nResearch shows when parents fed their preschool-aged children junk foods high in sugar, salt and unhealthy fats, it had a lasting impact on their taste preferences. All of the children tested showed preferences for junk foods, and all (even those who were just 3 years old!) were also able to recognize some soda, fast food and junk food brands.\nThe researchers concluded what you probably already suspect: kids who were exposed to junk food, soda and fast food, via advertising and also because their parents fed them these foods, learned to recognize and prefer these foods over healthier choices. This does have an impact on their health, as nutrients from quality foods are critical in helping your child reach his or her fullest potential!\nOne study from British researchers revealed that kids who ate a predominantly processed food diet at age 3 had lower IQ scores at age 8.5. For each measured increase in processed foods, participants had a 1.67-point decrease in IQ.\nAs you might suspect, the opposite also held true, with those eating healthier diets experiencing higher IQ levels. For each measured increase in dietary score, which meant the child was eating more fruits and vegetables for instance, there was a 1.2-point increase in IQ.\nThe reality is, the best time to shape your kids' eating habits is while they're still young. This means starting from birth with breast milk and then transitioning to solid foods that have valuable nutrients, like egg yolk, avocado and sweet potatoes. (You can easily cross any form of grain-based infant cereal off of this list.)\nFrom there, ideally you will feed your child healthy foods that your family is also eating -- grass-fed meats, organic veggies, vegetable juice, raw dairy and nuts, and so on. These are the foods your child will thrive on, and it's important they learn what real, healthy food is right from the get-go. This way, when they become tweens and teenagers, they may eat junk food here and there at a friend's house, but they will return to real food as the foundation of their diet -- and that habit will continue on with them for a lifetime.\nThis is What Happens When You Let Marketers Dictate Your Kid's Diet \u2026\nThe state of most kids' diets in the United States is not easy to swallow. As IWG reported:\n- Nearly 40% of children's diets come from added sugars and unhealthy fats.\n- Only 21% of youth age 6-19 eat the recommended five or more servings of fruits and vegetables each day\nThis is a veritable recipe for disease, and is a primary reason why today's kids are arguably less healthy than many prior generations. Obesity, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure -- these are diseases that once appeared only in middle-age and beyond, but are now impacting children. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that by 2050, one in three U.S. adults will have diabetes -- one of them could be your child if you do not take steps to cancel out the messages junk-food marketers are sending and instead teach them healthy eating habits.\nMake no mistake, the advertisers are doing all they can to lure your child in.\nIn fact, last year the food and beverage industry spent more than $40 billion, yes billion, lobbying congress against regulations that would decrease the marketing of unhealthy foods to kids. You can do a lot of persuading with $40 billion, which may explain why food manufacturers are allowed to get away with so much -- like putting pictures of fruit all over product packaging when the product actually contains no fruit.\nA 2011 study by the Prevention Institute even found that 84 percent of food packages that contain symbols specifically intended to help people choose healthier foods did not meet even basic nutritional standards! In fact, 57 percent of these \"Better-for-You\" children's foods were high in sugar, 95 percent contained added sugar, and 21 percent contained artificial colors. So you need to be very wary when buying any processed foods for your kids, even the \"healthy\" ones, as they will most certainly contain large amounts of fructose with very little to offer in the way of healthy nutrition.\nHelp Fight Back Against Junk-Food Marketers and Stand Up for Kids' Health\nThe Prevention Institute's \"We're Not Buying It\" campaign is petitioning President Obama to put voluntary, science-based nutrition guidelines into place for companies that market foods to kids. You can sign this petition now, but I urge you to go a step further and stop supporting the companies that are marketing junk foods to your children today.\nIdeally, you and your family will want to vote with your pocketbook and avoid as much processed food as possible and use unprocessed raw, organic and\/or locally grown foods as much as possible. Your children should be eating the same wholesome foods you are -- they don't need bright-blue juice or deep-fried \"nuggets\" any more than you do.\nIf you and your kids are absolutely hooked on fast food and other processed foods, you're going to need some help and most likely some support from friends and family if you want to kick the junk-food lifestyle. Besides surrounding yourself with supportive, like-minded people, you can also review my article \"How to Wean Yourself Off Processed Foods in 7 Steps\" or read the book I wrote on the subject, called Generation XL: Raising Healthy, Intelligent Kids in a High-Tech, Junk-Food World.\nFinally, my nutrition plan offers a step-by-step guide to feed your family right, and I encourage you to read through it now. You need to first educate yourself about proper nutrition and the dangers of junk food and processed foods in order to change the food culture of your entire family. To give your child the best start at life, and help instill healthy habits that will last a lifetime, you must lead by example. Children will simply not know which foods are healthy unless you, as a parent, teach it to them first.","id":"<urn:uuid:f212f6fc-c358-4ebf-b694-a8eb315dfe06>","dump":"CC-MAIN-2013-20","url":"http:\/\/articles.mercola.com\/sites\/articles\/archive\/2011\/10\/24\/stop-junk-food-marketing-to-kids.aspx?x_cid=021412Care2","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2013-20\/segments\/1368699881956\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20130516102441-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9687580466,"token_count":1797,"score":2.96875,"int_score":3}
{"text":"The aviation sector is renowned as a carbon intensive business, but an increasing number of airports are looking to change that by integrating the latest green-tech into their daily operations.\nAir travel and transport accounts for two percent of all human generated greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) -- with airports contributing five percent to the overall aviation figure.\nBy adapting clean energy policies and technologies, eco-conscious airport operators hope to make a dent in these numbers and boost the industry's environmental street-cred.\n\"We are making our airports greener, while balancing the tremendous economic impacts they deliver for our region,\" says Amy Malick, deputy commissioner of sustainability for the Chicago Department of Aviation (CDA), which will host the fifth annual Airports Going Green conference this November.\nThe conference provides a platform for over 400 airport executives and green thinkers from around the world to present programs, strategies, and lessons-learned regarding airport sustainability.\n\"(We are) committed to implementing sustainable initiatives at our airports that enhance the quality of life for citizens,\" she adds.\nMalick highlights how the CDA has installed over 230,000 square feet of vegetated roof space at Chicago O'Hare and Midway International Airport, ensured all Chicago airport trucks are fueled with ultra-low sulfur diesel gas and insisted recycled materials are utilized in all airports when possible.\nAs a result, the CDA has saved 76,000 tons of CO2 from being pumped out by Chicago's airports alone, she claims.\nAcross the U.S. like-minded schemes are taking off with increasing regularity. Airports such as Boston Logan and Denver International now generate a small percentage of their energy requirements from renewable energy sources (such as on site wind and solar).\nIn Europe meanwhile 64 airports have joined the Airport Carbon Accreditation program, which recognizes innovative eco-airport efforts.
